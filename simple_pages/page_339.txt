Do you want to know how to get out of the trap?
RAPHAELA

WES
That’s the problem. So you should sit down with the understanding that you don’t want to get 
out of the trap and then that’s at least clear between us. And you won’t complain about it. The 
rest of your life, when you notice it’s not working and it’s trapped and your trapped and things 
are kind of dead, and you’re not getting off  on things, and you’re bitching and moaning about 
complaining about things and the people around you are bitchers and moaners and complain-
ers—all friends—then that’ll be okay with you because you took a stand in The Forum that 
you prefer that.

WES
Do you want to get out of the trap?
RAPHAELA
Yes.
WES

RAPHAELA
I’m willing to listen.
