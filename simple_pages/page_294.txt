SPEAKING BEING
KEVIN
Okay.
ERHARD
It’s a stand one takes in the matter. That’s what Wes is discussing with you, to put it in more 
technical language.
KEVIN
Okay. 
ERHARD
That’s what he means when he says “It’s whatever you say it is.”
KEVIN
Okay.
ERHARD
Like a declaration.
KEVIN.
My breakthrough was my racket, fi nding my racket, which was standing right in front of me all 
the time, was that I have to do everything: Every goddamned thing in the world for everybody. I 
even have to run this Forum for you.
(laughter)
Now there’s going to be some people laughing, but as The Forum went along, I realized that I 
was running The Forum because The Forum wasn’t working out the right way for me, so I was 
having to make adjustments in The Forum so it was working out right for me. And so I made 
those adjustments. When I wanted to go to the bathroom, I went to the bathroom. And I tried to 
come on time, but I was late a couple of times, so I guess that means that I didn’t really try.
WES
No it means you were late.
KEVIN (laughing)
Sorry I said that.
ERHARD
You did try. 
KEVIN
Okay. I have to do everything because everybody around me is ineff ective. And I am very good 
at it. I can do anything. Fix this, make sure everything gets done, and I can’t let anybody do 
anything for me. And I was aware of this, but I never saw this was such a dominant feature of 
my life as I did until today. At that point it leaves my mind blank.
