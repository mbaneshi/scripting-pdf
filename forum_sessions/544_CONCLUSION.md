CONCLUSION
Technology of Transformation
Two fundamental questions have guided our inquiry that has, at last, brought us
to bring to language Erhard‚Äôs technology of transformation as we have witnessed
it in the dialogue of The Forum and in our ruminations that have brought Heideg-
ger‚Äôs and Erhard‚Äôs thinking face-to-face: What are the foundations of Erhard‚Äôs rhetor-
ical and ontological rhetoric? How does the dialogic rhetorical structure of The Forum
achieve ontological transformation?
First, what are the foundations of Erhard‚Äôs rhetorical and ontological rhetoric?
We have sought to show that both Heidegger‚Äôs philosophy and Erhard‚Äôs
rhetoric are founded upon the existence and nature of what Heidegger calls the
ontological difference, the difference between beings and Being. Both projects
attempt to span this difference and to develop a language through which beings can
speak and communicate Being. The Forum may be seen as the practical, rhetorical
development of Heidegger‚Äôs thought in this area; Erhard appears to have taken
certain difficult Heideggerian ideas and made them accessible in a profound way.
It is not our thesis, however, that Heidegger‚Äôs thought is foundational
t
to Erhard‚Äôs work as a whole. According to Erhard, his project was generated
by an experience of ontological transformation which he underwent in 1971;
his subsequent work has been an evolving attempt to communicate that
transformation experience. His use of Heideggerian terms and concepts in this effort
began just a few years prior to the time The Forum replaced the est Training in 1985,
t
and indeed, it may be argued that this encounter was crucial in this development
of Erhard‚Äôs work, which development continues to this day in Landmark Worldwide
and in his new work with speaking the Being of leadership. In any event, while
drawing upon Heidegger‚Äôs ontological language to express his own transformation,
Erhard has simultaneously extended the communicative possibilities of that
Heideggerian language. That is, he has shown how a dialogue with Being might look
in lived experience and what its effect might be for those who participate in such an
unfolding ontological dialogue.
Thus the foundation of Erhard‚Äôs rhetoric may be seen to be its relationship with
Being, and that where ontological language speaks from determines its power: that

The strategic dialogue in which this process occurs is from time to time
characterized by aggressiveness and intrusiveness on Erhard‚Äôs part, and by frequent
resistance on the part of his dialogic partners. Heidegger has pointed out that
any attempt to analyze Being constantly has the character of doing violence to
the complacency of the everyday interpretation. Thus what occurs in The Forum
is the violation of the everyday interpretation, as identity (the ‚Äúthey‚Äù self) is
deconstructed and Being is wrested from unconcealment. In the process, Erhard‚Äôs
rhetoric sometimes seems intrusive, and the dialogue which it stimulates is often
combative; yet during the four days of The Forum the results of the dialogue are
dramatic.
Central to Erhard‚Äôs achievement is his rhetorical development of two
Heideggerian ideas. The first is the complex and elusive notion of appropriation,
which addresses the central paradox of the being-Being relationship: that human
beings can attain ontological freedom only by recognizing and allowing their
fundamental subservience to the play of Being. The second is the encounter with
the Nothing, the emptiness and meaningless correlative to the mood of anxiety.
Both of these ideas are communicated, in The Forum‚Äôs persistent and reiterative
ontological rhetoric, so that they can be apprehended as ontological insights:
that is, so that they produce a result in the participants‚Äô way of Being by virtue of
discovering it for themselves, rather than simply being understood conceptually.
Through the reiterated dialogic communication of these ontological insights,
participants in The Forum‚Äôs dialogue come increasingly to dwell in the ontological
assumptions given by those insights, and then act in their lives with freedom to be
in the very circumstances that would otherwise appear as constraints.
Embedded in both of these Heideggerian ideas, and basic to The Forum‚Äôs
ontological rhetoric, is the figure of reflexivity. That is, for both Heidegger and
Erhard, what is necessary for the creation of a clearing for Being is that human
beings turn around and see themselves as they are. Thus The Forum is fundamentally
the enactment of a reflexive turn, a rhetorical figure par excellence: participants in
The Forum, by virtue of its technology of transformation, speak a language designed
to reveal them as they are, so that what may be simultaneously revealed, within and
beyond the way they are, is their own largest possibility.
We conclude that Erhard‚Äôs work is both a manifestation of the metaphysical/
technological tradition and a new appropriation of that tradition. Therefore, on the
Heideggerian view, it is an appropriate venue for a reflexive thinking which can step
back, and in taking such a step, to reach beyond the current technological paradigm
by reaching through that paradigm. The technology of The Forum is putting-into-
use putting itself to use in order to turn and see itself face-to-face. It is calculative,
technological thinking calculating its own deconstruction, reflexion radicalized
for the appropriation of its own essential nature. As a dialogic, rhetorical project,
it extends the communicative possibilities of Heidegger‚Äôs thinking, and makes the
event of appropriation, and the freeing release which it occasions, available to an
audience which Heidegger‚Äôs work is likely never to reach.
