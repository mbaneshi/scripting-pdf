WES
Like the people over there who’ve really got it made have less problems than you do.
DONALD
But... they do.
(laughter)r
WES
No, they don’t. I promise you they don’t. They have more problems than you.
DONALD
So it’s something like the relationship with the problems?
WES
Yeah. They are able to relate to problems as part of the game.
DONALD
Instead of that it shouldn’t be.
WES
Exactly.
DONALD
Oh, I got it. Earlier someone said that problems are a declaration. You said no. But they are a
declaration...
WES
We’re a little ahead of ourselves. “In life there are problems” is ultimately a declaration. And
“In life, problems shouldn’t be” is ultimately a declaration.
DONALD
We just don’t know that.
WES
Right.
DONALD
So, would the declaration that problems show up in be a complaint declaration?
WES
Yeah.
Forum Day Four: Session Two
405
DONALD (sitting)
Okay I’m done.
TIM
The diffi  culty I’m having is to get the baggage away from the problem I carry because of the cul-
ture and my own experiences, because when I hear the word “problem,” whether it “shouldn’t
be” or “in life there are problems,” there are invitations to certain kinds of action around the
word problem, like “solve it,” or “do something about it.”
WES
Very good. Yeah.
TIM
Or “remedy.”
WES
Sure, we haven’t gotten there yet. “Shouldn’t be”: What is the response to something that
shouldn’t be?
TIM
You get rid of it...
WES
Get rid of it. Do something about it. Solve it. Fix it. Change it. Right?
TIM
Right. Find the solution.
WES
Find the solution. Solve it! See we never notice something. Let me tell you something about this
conversation. We’re doing diff erent dimensions. It isn’t like you have to get everything on the
same dimension. But you have to get the dimensions to get the conversations. We did this on
the fi rst day, right? In geometry we learned about three axes.
Wes drew a diagram on the board representing the x, y, and z axes.
WES (continuing)
You know you can’t collapse those. That’s the very nature of them, that they are distinct axes;
they etch out diff erent dimensions. What people try to do to fi gure things out—because fi guring
out has to have things in a linear fashion—is they try to fi t everything on a single axis. What
they don’t see is that there’s power in creating in a conversation a group of dimensions, which
when you get them all, you get the picture. You can’t put a sphere on one dimension, can you?
406
SPEAKING BEING
You can’t even put a circle in one dimension. Before you can have a circle you have to create
the two dimensions. So we’re creating diff erent dimensions in this conversation. Okay, so we’ll
jump dimensions somewhat.
TIM
So, your invitation to me is to look at the possibility that the word “problem” can exist in a dif-
ferent dimension than with “solution.”
WES
Yeah: a diff erent context in which you will not be immediately moved to solve it.
TIM
Got it.
WES
Hold on a second. What you’re bringing up is great. This whole thing about problem/solution:
Here’s one thing that people almost always never get.
Wes walked over to a the chalkboard on stage right and erased “Right/wrong; dominate/avoid domi-
nation; justifi es itself/invalidates others.”
WES (continuing)
Take a look at any problem that you’ve had and look at what you’ve done with it. What you’ve done
with it is: solved it in some way. The way people solve problems is they do something about it, and
if that didn’t work, they do something more, and if that didn’t work, they do something better, and
if that didn’t work, they do something diff erent. They are led to dealing with it, solving it.
(drawing a “P” on the board and then encircling it)
You’ve got a problem, and then you solve it. What happens with regard to the solution to the
problem?
TIM
It becomes a truth, or something right, the right thing to do.
WES
Yes. But it’s worse than that. You have to actually look at a problem that you’ve had that you’ve solved
and then look at the solution to see what happened to it. Take a look at a problem that you had.
TIM
I’m thinking: Some solutions become problems.
WES
Yes, exactly! The solution becomes your next problem.
WES (continuing)
Forum Day Four: Session Two
407
TIM
Some.
WES
No, all of them! When they’re solutions. Take a look. It’s a very nasty trap. What’s a very big
problem for somebody in high school?
TIM
Zits.
(laughter)r
WES
Yeah but only because zits mean something: That’s the real problem.
TIM
Yes.
WES
If all the models had zits, zits would be good. What does that mean?
TIM
Looking good.
WES
Getting a boyfriend, getting a girlfriend, and getting laid. Have you forgotten?
(laughter)r
Grades too, but we’ll talk about getting laid because it’s more fun.
(laughter)r
So that’s the big problem. Look back at your life and look at teenagers and see what it’s all
about. It was about getting a girlfriend, getting a boyfriend, and getting laid, and also getting
laid with the right one. So, many people immediately solved that problem right out of high
school. What did they do?
TIM
They get married. And then they’ve got a new problem.
WES
That becomes the next problem. Aren’t marriages that solve problems the next problem? I didn’t
say marriages are a problem. Listen carefully. Marriage is not a problem. Marriage is marriage.
408
SPEAKING BEING
But when marriage is a solution to a problem, it becomes the next problem. This is the way it is
for most people: For most people a relationship is a solution to a problem. What do you think
that does to the relationship? It turns it into a thing, with a group of expectations. It becomes
part of your racket. That’s not relating. You turn someone else into a solution to your problem.
That’s what you’re relating with and that’s not relating. That’s making it a problem. How many
people found it diffi  cult at some point in The Forum, for them?
(a large number of people raising their hands)
You know how some people solved that problem? There are people for whom that’s a real prob-
lem. When they experience something, that’s a real problem; they don’t like something, it’s a real
problem. You know how they solve that? Some people? They leave. That’s their solution to the
problem. Not a lot of people; a couple people. You think that ends up as a problem for them? What
about the relationships that you’ve left? Look at a relationship. And it was a problem and the way
you dealt with it is you left it. You will drag that crummy relationship around with you forever.
That’s this whole thing about being incomplete with your parents: That’s at the source of it.
TIM
Okay I understand it in the examples you used and it makes real sense that solutions become
problems.
WES
Well, it’s part of the quote that Kipp butchered. Where is Kipp? I’ll read it to you exactly: “The
world that we have made as a result of the level of thinking we have done thus far creates prob-
lems that we cannot solve at the same level we created them at.” Because if we solve them at the
same level we created them at, we are in worse shape.
TIM
Well that still doesn’t address the issue though of needing to be solved.
WES
No, no, no, no, you’re trying to go too fast. You’re trying to solve the problem called “solving
doesn’t work.”
TIM
Yeah, that you solve it at a diff erent level. That’s the invitation of Einstein anyway: to solve it at
a diff erent level.
WES
We’re going to give you a diff erent level. And it won’t be the level... the level that you deal with
problems, what you call solutions...
TIM
The “shouldn’t be...”
WES (continuing)
Forum Day Four: Session Two
409
WES (drawing larger circles around the fi rst circle around the “P”)”
...becomes the next problem, which you then solve, which becomes the next problem. So you’ve
got to solve that one, which becomes the next problem. On and on and on: which is all racket,
by the way, and leaves you looking like this.
(hunching over)r
TIM
It seems that there are problems.
WES
It says up here “In life there are problems” that occur in languaging.
TIM
There are problems with solutions that don’t become problems.
WES
Really? Give me one.
TIM
I left my wallet where I bought a gift. And I came and sat down and realized I left my wallet.
I sat there and thought, “Gee, I don’t remember putting my wallet away.” I got up and went to
check my coat and my wallet wasn’t there. So I left and went to the store...
WES
But this is a story. I don’t hear any problem in this.
TIM
So you’re defi ning that losing a wallet is not a problem.
WES
No, not necessarily a problem.
TIM
Unless you say “it shouldn’t be.”
WES
Exactly. Losing a wallet is losing a wallet. Having cancer is having cancer. People are going to
die. “Those people with cancer are going to die!” You are going to die.
TIM
What are the problems that are in life? Give me a problem in life?
The Drift
The work of both Erhard and Heidegger is the generation and
development (the teasing out) of primordial metaphors, which
may be held, for the purpose of this discussion, as what Erhard has
called distinctions (and more recently, “linguistic abstractions”),
the distinguishing of which unconceals new possibilities for Being-
in-the-world.
410
SPEAKING BEING
WES
Any one you got, they belong here, because they belong in life.
TIM
Not because they shouldn’t be but because they are there. So saying “shouldn’t be” doesn’t make
them a problem.
WES
No: “Shouldn’t be” is the source of your problems and the solutions to your problems that are at-
tached to your rackets. Now we’re going to look at problems outside your racket to see what you can
do with them. What would you have to give up to have the problems that you have—not changing
them—but to have the problems that you have and just have them? You’d have to give up a lot.
(indicating Nicole, and her unfi nished thesis)
She’d have to give up a lot with the thesis: a lot of story, and “something’s wrong,” “something’s
wrong with me,” or “something’s wrong with it,” or “my mother...” She’d have to give that all up.
Then she’d have a problem. “I need to get my thesis done and I’m not getting it done.” That’s the
name of that tune. If she would be with it like that she’d have to give up all the “shouldn’t be”s
around that, right?
TIM
Yes.
WES
She’s solved that problem about the thesis a lot. She gave some explanations about it as a way to
solve it. She lied about it as a way to solve it. See how those solutions are building the problem?
TIM
I think I’m getting it. So a problem can exist out of the context of “shouldn’t be...”
WES
But not out of the context of languaging.
TIM
In life... They are there... Period.
WES
Yeah. Problems will occur in languaging one way or the other, because that’s all there is for
human beings.
TIM
They are a rainstorm.
The development of a distinction begins with positing what at
first appears to be a definition or premise—a “hint”—that participants
then “try on,” and from which they are to “stand” and then “look out”
at their everyday lives, and fill in for themselves what is hinted at in
the hint. In dialogue with Erhard and the other course leaders—in
combination with witnessing such dialogues—participants share
what they see, and in the authentic space of this sharing, the distinc-
tion continues to emerge in the background, in what is unsaid in the
conversation that directs our attention to a way of seeing and Being-
in-the-world—a world that is itself being called out into unconceal-
ment by the series of hints. The very act of undergoing a dialogue in
which a distinction is distinguished gives Being-in-the-world.
Calling a distinction by a descriptive title, then, such as “sto-
ry,” or “what happened,” or “concern,” or “distinction,” or “racket,”
or “empty and meaningless” can only ever be a hint, a piece of
a whole that cannot ever be fully represented adequately as a
descriptive statement. Thus, these “hints” function rhetorically as
metaphors, language that on the surface is familiar, but once we
take up the language and follow its movement, it “turns” us away
toward something utterly diff erent from itself. What makes these
metaphors “primordial” is that speaking them, and following
them, brings forth Being-in-the-world from nothing. What makes
the work of Erhard so distinctive is precisely this approach.
Through his encounter with Heidegger’s thinking, Erhard has
said, new specifications for the communication of his work became
available—ways to say things more pointedly, increasing the work’s
value to participants (Erhard, interview with the authors). The funda-
mental dynamic of Erhard’s work—its all-encompassing generative
distinction—has remained consistent since its inception as the est
Training, and throughout its iteration as The Forum. At the same time,
new languagings have been added to its vocabulary, creating other
paths into the generative distinction. But just as Heidegger’s language
evolved significantly over the course of his career, Erhard has consis-
tently experimented with other new primordial metaphors.
Experimentation is essential if such a methodology of language
is to retain its generative power. An ontological distinction is com-
municated in the unspoken background as concepts are generated
Forum Day Four: Session Two
411
WES
No, there is languaging.
TIM
Languaging creates the rainstorm.
WES
Languaging creates everything.
TIM
Yeah. Including problems.
WES
Including problems. And you are given an already way of relating to problems. We’re giving you
a new way to relate to problems: to let them be.
TIM
Okay.
WES
For the moment. In order to deal with something powerfully, you have to be able to let it be.
I can change the fl oor if I could let it be. If I’m arguing about the fl oor all day I’ll never get
around to changing it. From complaining about the fl oor all day I’ll never get to deal with it.
TIM
Thank you.
WES
We’ve got “problems are in languaging,” and we’ve got a way where we can let them be. It’s
okay to have a problem. They occur in languaging. We want to look at a specifi c problem to
see what access we have to the problem when we let it be. Now I’m going to share my one real
problem—the problem of all The Forum leaders who live in California. My problem is “I want
to go to the beach but I don’t have time. I’m always in The Forum.” Whatever your problem is, it
fi ts in that form. Something... but something.
On the chalkboard Wes wrote “I want to go to the beach but I don’t have time” on the chalkboard.
(continuing)
You need to take one of your problems and put it in that form. Get the confl icting things.
The way you get something stuck is you get one force opposed by an equal and opposite
force. They have to be equal and opposite or you won’t get stuck. If one force is bigger than the
other, there will be movement. Anybody who can’t see that? That’s the nature of a problem.
in the foreground of a conversation; but the distinction maintains its
force only while those concepts are being generated. In this relevant
passage, Heidegger distinguishes two ways in which beings (includ-
ing ideas and concepts) can be brought to appear in the world:
Considered in terms of the essence of space,
the diff erence between the two types of
appearing is this: appearing in the first and
authentic sense, as the gathered bringing-it-
self-to-stand, takes space in; it first conquers
space; as standing-there, it creates space for
itself; it brings about everything that belongs
to it, while it itself is not imitated.
“
Appearing in the second sense merely steps
forth from an already prepared space, and it is
viewed by a looking-at within the already fixed
dimensions of this space. The aspect off ered by
the thing, and no longer the thing itself, now
becomes what is decisive. Appearing in the first
sense rips space open. Appearing in the second
sense simply gives space an outline and measures
the space that has been opened up. (IM 203–204,
emphasis and paragraphing added)
“
In the initial saying of a primordial metaphor, then, the space of a
distinction is ripped open. Subsequently, with each new and onto-
logically consonant languaging of that distinction—or with each re
iteration of the dialogic unfolding of the series of hints—the space
that has been created expands.
But this demands that the space be opened newly in each occur-
y
rence. Erhard is emphatic on this point: “I never repeat material,” he
told an audience in 1989, “and I mean that quite literally. Every time
I deal with something, I deal with it anew, like something to make
present between you and me” (“Beyond the Winning Formula”).
Two categories of distinctions are suggested by the two guid-
ing questions of The Forum. The first category includes our current
but concealed ways of being human—our “blind spots.” These are
412
SPEAKING BEING
Problems in life are presented as two equal but opposite forces in which you get stuck. Get a
problem up for yourself and see that they are constructed by equal but opposite forces. The
only problem with this is that there are some lies up here. What’s a lie up here?
GRACE
It’s the word “but” and it implies that there is no solution or no way out, or that you’re stuck.
WES
Okay. Here is what “but” means, and why it’s a problem: Problems are created by buts...
(laughter)r
Welcome to the fourth day of The Forum. Problems are created by buts, because “but” means
what follows it—this is the logic of linguistics here, okay—what follows “but” negates what pre-
cedes it, like an equal and opposite force to it. “I want to go to the beach” is stopped by the equal
and opposite force “I don’t have enough time,” because of “but.” You see that?
GRACE
Say “and”?
WES
Why would we want to say “and”?
GRACE
If you say “and” you have two things to look at and you can do something if you want to.
WES
That’s close. Here’s the question. “But” says this is an equal and opposite force to that. Is it really?
GRACE
No. They are two separate issues!
WES
What’s the equal and opposite force to “I don’t have time”?
GRACE
“I have time.”
WES
“I do have time,” right? “I do have time” is the equal and opposite force to “I don’t have time,”
so that’s what’s really equal and opposite. And “I don’t want to go to the beach” is the equal and
opposite force to “I want to go to the beach.”
the things about ourselves and our behavior that “we don’t know
that we don’t know,” which emerge within the question: “What is
the Being of human beings?” In the second category are the new
possibilities of Being, which can be distinguished only when the
blind spots have been discovered and chosen, and the background
of meaninglessness revealed as it is within the question: “What is
the possibility of Being for human beings?”
This categorization is certainly valid at the levels of aff ect and
value—the “bad” behaviors we want to change versus the im-
proved versions we want to create—but considered ontologically,
the diff erence is only apparent. The distinctions in both categories
assign meaning to the meaningless. But, it may be argued, were
not the behaviors being distinguished in the first category—such
as my racket—already there, albeit unrecognized?
Heidegger responds that they have always been available as
possibilities. “What is spoken out is already necessarily within phy-
sis (Being), otherwise it could not be spoken from out of it” (FCM
26). This is why its emergence into the world clicks for us even as
it blows us away, occurring as something that at some level we
already knew; and thus its showing up is accompanied by “the ring
of truth,” as shown in this brilliant passage from Being and Time:
Before Newton’s laws were discovered, they
were not ‘true’; it does not follow that they
were false, or even that they would
become false if ontically no discoveredness
were any longer possible. [. . .] To say that
before Newton his laws were neither true nor
false, cannot signify that before him there
were no such entities as have been uncov-
ered and pointed out by those laws. Through
Newton the laws became true and with them,
entities became accessible in themselves to
Dasein. Once entities have been uncovered,
they show themselves precisely as entities
which beforehand already were. Such uncover-
ing is the kind of Being which belongs to ‘truth.’
(BT 269, emphasis added)
“
WES (continuing)
Forum Day Four: Session Two
413
WES (indicating both independent clauses of the sentence on the board)
These two are not equal and opposite forces: That’s the lie. It’s possible to have both of those and
no confl ict. They are not inherently confl icting. The “but” makes them confl icting. So, we change
“but” to “and.” If we say, “I want to go to the beach and I don’t have time,” we’d be telling the
truth about the two forces operating on us. “I want to go to the beach,” and “I don’t have time.”
But is there a problem? Does “I want to go to the beach and I don’t have time” occur as a problem?
GRACE
Yes, it occurs as a problem because you’re dealing with two opposing forces.
WES
No, they are not opposing.
GRACE
They’re separate and distinct.
WES
You’re the one who said so a moment ago.
GRACE
Right. What next?
WES
So: “I am here in The Forum and I want to eat.” Is that a problem?
GRACE
Not unless there’s a “but” in there.
WES
Do you hear a problem there?
GRACE
No.
WES
But: “I’m here in The Forum, but I’m starving to death.” Do you hear a problem?
GRACE
Yes.
WES
Taking the same forces and I’ve presented them to create a confl ict, at which I am at the eff ect
and stuck with. And it comes from, not from life, because in reality there are no problems, it
The ring of truth signals not only “Of course! That’s true!” but also,
embedded in its reverberations, “It’s been true all along.”
¥
In the early- to mid-1980s, during the period when the est Train-
t
ing was being retired and The Forum was being generated, Erhard’s
organization produced a series of audiotapes. In them, we hear Erhard
developing distinctions, oft en in dialogic sessions with seminar
participants. In some, the influence of Heidegger’s vocabulary may be
heard. In others, we observe Erhard exploring other articulations. As
with Heidegger, Erhard’s work is generated from a central distinction,
which may be approached from an abundance of starting points.
One such starting point is the drift , a distinction developed
on the 1985 audiotape, “Eff ective Action and Accomplishment.”
This distinction opens a way to Erhard’s central transformational
distinction; we suggest that the dynamic of this distinction may be
analogized to several that Heidegger hints at throughout his work,
with rubrics such as thrownness, the “they,” and the play of Being.
To use a Heideggerian term, the two men are saying the Same (see
the sidebar entitled “The Same” in Session Three of Day Three).
In this 1985 seminar, the distinction is teased out collabora-
tively in the interactions between Erhard and the seminar partici-
pants, all of whom have had previous experience of The Forum and
are familiar with Erhard’s basic vocabulary of distinctions and the
rhetorical dialogue in which they get distinguished. In what follows
here, we provide brief excerpts (elisions are not shown).
Erhard opens the seminar with the image of a “boat in the
water with no rudder and no sails”:
Now when you put a boat in the water it
doesn’t stay still. It moves. And some ninny on
the shore might say, “Boy, there’s a lot of in-
tention in that boat.” But really what there is
in the boat is drift . So I want to invent this dis-
tinction for ourselves called the drift . You and
I are drift ing. Life is drift ing. The world is drift -
ing. Humanity is drift ing. The United States is
drift ing. . . . There’s a certain drift . And there’s
no distinction called the drift .
“
414
SPEAKING BEING
comes from me and my speaking. So here’s what there is to get: all your problems as stucknesses
are lies. All your problems as stucknesses are lies. All the presentation of the stuff  there, that’s
not a lie. “I want to go to the beach and I don’t have time”: That’s not a lie and it’s not a problem.
GRACE
Right.
WES
Any time you fi nd yourself stuck. Not moving. That’s bullshit. You’ve lied. Wake up! The stuck is the
lie. It comes from the—not the use of the word “but”—this is not about take every “but” out of your
language—this is about: Appreciate what you’re presenting in the problem, with “but,” or whatever
you use. Whenever you try to make things opposing and put yourself at the eff ect of them, there’s a lie
there and you’re doing it, and the lie is that you’re not doing it. The lie is: You’re not doing it when you
really are. That’s the lie. Nothing is inherently stuck in life. Life’s moving along fi ne. You see that?
GRACE
Yes.
As Grace sat Donald raised his hand and stood up again.
DONALD
So if I say “I want to lose weight, but I hate dieting,” there’s a lie there. It’s like saying “I want to
lose weight and you’re wearing a black vest.” Or “I want to lose weight and Vaclav Havel is the
president of Yugoslavia.”
WES
Yeah, it’s that crazy, really. Why would anybody be so crazy as to do that?
DONALD
To be a victim.
WES
Not just victim, but to be a racketeer.
DONALD
So if I say “I’m overweight because my mother used to make fritters,” that’s the same lie.
WES
Yeah.
DONALD
Like “I’m overweight because you’re wearing a black sweater.” But the reason I blame my mother,
say, when I don’t like dieting, is because I’ve...
So there’s this enormous body of superstition
about accomplishment and failure which has
nothing whatsoever to do with accomplish-
ment or failure. It’s merely the drift . . . . I want
you to see that in many ways you are a drift
for yourself. You have a certain drift . The tide
comes in, you go this way; the tide goes out,
you go that way. So in many ways, you your-
self are a part of the drift  for you yourself.
“
Now if this one drift s into the other one, they
impact each other. But that’s all part of the
drift , yes? Your relationships drift . They’ve got
a life of their own. Projects drift , they’ve got
a life of their own. When I’m considering the
distinction “accomplishment,” my question is,
what impacts the drift ?
“
The distinction is teased out in the subsequent dialogue between
Erhard and the seminar participants. Some of what appears here
in embryonic form would later be developed in the Being a Leader
Course (http://beingaleader.net) Erhard has developed together
with Michael Jensen (Professor Emeritus of Economics at the
Harvard Business School), Steve Zaff ron (CEO of the Vanto Group),
Kari Granger (Fellow, Center For Character and Leadership Devel-
opment, United States Air Force Academy), and Jeri Echeverria
(Professor and Provost Emerita for the California State University,
Fresno). The next sidebar presents an excerpt from the pre-course
readings for the Being a Leader Course (from 2015). ■

WES
You’ve gotta have something be wrong.
DONALD
It’s fun to be stuck in “I’m fat and my mother...” There’s more juice in the being stuck than in
just going ahead and losing weight. What’s that about?
WES
It’s called “racket.” That’s what it’s about.
DONALD
Okay, so I’ve got a racket.
WES
You are a racket. And your whole “fat” story is part of your racket. All your problems about
“fat” are part of your racket, and all your solutions to those problems are part of the racket. And
all your not-solutions to those problems are part of the racket...
DONALD
If it’s a racket then there’s some payoff  holding it in place.
WES
Absolutely.
DONALD
I thought it happened the other way around. The costs... I got the costs... There’s some payoff  in
holding onto my little problem here. So I’ve got some payoff ...
WES
You want to be looking at what Donald is looking at: your problems and their relationships to
your racket, and your payoff s and your costs. That’s what the conversation—that’s what makes
the diff erence in the conversation; that’s what you want to be looking at. There should be an
opening into the problems that compose your life. Now—”That harmonizes with the rest of The
Forum?”—that’s what you want to be looking at.
DONALD
So I’ve got a racket called—I have, I’ve manufactured, I’ve created a racket called “I’m fat and
I want to lose weight,” right? This is a racket. I can see the costs. The costs are real clear: it’s
health, it’s aliveness, vitality.
WES
No your racket is, “I want to lose weight but I can’t.”
416
SPEAKING BEING
DONALD
Right, okay. That’s it.
WES
“And my mother’s the one who did it to me.” Was it your mother?
DONALD
Yeah. As a matter of fact.
(laughter)r
WES
You love to make your mother wrong! You really do. He can do it on a daily basis. He can live
now... Here’s how he solved the problem of how to make his mother wrong on a continual basis.
He has a problem with his weight. So every time he looks in the mirror his mother’s wrong.
Think about how accessible that is to him now. He doesn’t even need to call her up on the
phone. It’s just: Look in the mirror. That’s the payoff . Making her wrong is the payoff . You love
it. People love to make people wrong. There’s nothing like it: It’s the spice of life.
DONALD
Wes, I saw some people in New York a couple of weeks ago and they said, “Donald, you’ve
gained a lot of weight since moving to California.” I said “well, the relationship I moved out
here for didn’t work out.”
WES
Oh, so you made that relationship wrong.
DONALD
Got it.
WES (to the group)
Donald is learning something. His mother was the teacher—no, his need to make his mother
wrong is the teacher. He can make people wrong by gaining weight. It works every time. And
they did it to him. And they’re creeps, just like his mother, the original weight giver.
(laughter)r
By the way, your problems are like that. They repeat themselves. They’re repetitive in nature. So
that’s an insight.
DONALD
My mother...
Forum Day Four: Session Two
417
WES
And your solutions to problems, as rackets, are repetitive.
DONALD
I got another repetition. My mother never graduated from high school. She went to work
instead. She wanted us to go to university. It was a big thing in our family to go to university.
My mother really wanted all eleven of us to go to university, and I made my mother wrong by
dropping out. And so I get to be uneducated, to continue to make my mother wrong, and Dad
in there too. And so when she writes me letters... and tells me about my sister’s grades—like I
don’t give a shit about my sister—I wish she’d stop reminding me of her being about education,
because really she’s wrong. I really didn’t need to do that... So does that mean that in every prob-
lem that I have, I can see where I’m making someone wrong?
WES
Yeah.
DONALD
And if something happens, like if I lose my wallet, that’s not a problem and there’s no charge on
it, I could just go back to the store where I lost my wallet and get it back. So when something’s
there, there always has to be a lie for there to be stuckness...
WES
And whenever you lie, you lie for a purpose, to make someone or something wrong, to avoid the
domination of, to win, or to justify something: That’s why you lie. You lie to avoid the domina-
tion of something, someone, make someone wrong or make yourself right, win, avoid losing
and justify yourself and invalidating others. That’s why people lie. That’s the whole point of it.
DONALD
I caught myself lying on Wednesday, on Day One of this Forum, and I forget what process we
were sharing about, but I was saying that the airlines had messed up my fl ight, but what hap-
pened was more like a dance with the changing schedules.
WES
You were more committed to moving through the stops than you were to making something
wrong. If you were more committed to making something wrong, then that is what you would
have been engaged in, and you would have ended up with the problems that most people have.
DONALD
I was so committed to having it work that I called the offi  ce here in San Francisco to get the
address to send my bags here in case the fl ight got canceled again. I was committed to just have
it work. But then at the same time, I lied about it on the phone, complaining to someone that I
was stuck in Denver for three hours.
418
SPEAKING BEING
WES
Yeah, there’s nothing like a little sympathy along the way.
DONALD
You know the thing that I didn’t want to stand up and talk about was my weight because I
didn’t want to have eight hundred people come up and give me suggestions now.
(laughter)r
I think there’s like a stuckness that that creates.
WES (to the group)
Don’t give Donald suggestions.
DONALD
Okay, thanks, Wes. That’s it.
WES
Very good. Thank you.

What you want to be doing is looking at your problems and the payoff s to them.
ILLIANA
I’m trying to fi gure it out.
WES
Bad deal. Wrong deal.
ILLIANA
Okay. Just a second. My racket is that I want attention.
WES
What problem allows you to run the racket?
ILLIANA
Asking for attention.
WES
Is that the problem? Asking for attention?
ILLIANA
I have many diff erent problems on that basis.
“Way of Being” and the “Nature of Being for
Human Beings”
The following is an excerpt from the Pre-Course Reading Assign-
ment #5 from the Being a Leader Course (http://beingaleader.net)
as of fall 2015. In the manner in which this pedagogical document
opens up a way to distinguish the diff erence between “way of
being” for human beings, and the “fundamental and essential
nature of Being for human beings,” the authors find a further
development of Erhard’s work in The Forum (circa 1989) that both
continues to resonate with Heidegger’s thinking while experiment-
ing with new languagings of primordial metaphors.
What is Meant by “Way of Being”
In speaking about another person’s way of being you or I might
say, “She’s in a good mood,” or “That made him sad,” or “She’s
always cheerful,” or “He is an extrovert.”  We also sometimes simi-
larly think about our own way of being.
Our way of being is some combination of our mental state,
emotional state, bodily state, and our thoughts and thought pro-
cesses, and memories.  Or saying the same thing in more experi-
ential terms, our way of being is some combination of our attitude
or state of mind, and our feelings or emotions, plus our body
sensations, and our thoughts and memories.  For short, our way of
being is what is going on with us internally in a given moment or in
y
a given situation.
Note that the temporality of our way of being is what is going
on with us in a given moment or in
t
a given situation.  Even if a
certain way of being could be said to be our general or characteris-
tic way of being, none of us is always only the way we generally or
characteristically are.
Once you have checked out in your own experience what we
have said so far about way of being (and you should certainly do
that), what we have said becomes pretty obvious.  But, there are
two facts about our way of being that are at first perhaps not so
obvious:
Forum Day Four: Session Two
419
WES
Right: With this person and with that person...
ILLAINA
Yes.
WES
“I want attention from him but he’s not giving me any attention,” and so you develop a whole
story about what kind of person he is, and she’s had this problem before with other people, and
none of it should be, it’s all wrong and she’s less-than, and you’re into this whole crummy story
and somebody’s wrong. And somebody’s right. Of course she’s right and something else is wrong.
ILLIANA
From that I developed asking attention in diff erent ways.
WES
Right: as a solution. But they never really work, do they?
ILLIANA
No. Until today. I don’t get what I want.
WES
Yeah.
ILLIANA
Now, you said to bring up the problem, okay? The problem that I came up with was... I’m deal-
ing now in my life with a... working with a new company, trying to do something that I don’t
believe I can do. And what I really want is their attention, to know that I can do it.
WES
Yeah, and that’ll make everything lousy, with no satisfaction. She’s doing it to get attention, not to
produce results. There will be no accomplishment, and she’ll never get enough attention, so she’ll
be driven, and it’s a racket. And she’ll also conclude about it that it shouldn’t be. The whole situation
“shouldn’t be,” and you shouldn’t be this way. However it turns out, “it shouldn’t be.” And you’ll have
a problem again, and that shouldn’t be. And so now you can stand in empty and meaningless and see
the absurdity of that. The absurdity of the problem called “needing attention.” You want attention?
ILLIANA
Yeah.
WES
Great. Take what you get and call that “attention.” That would be a possibility, right? From
empty and meaningless?
Fact One
Our actions from moment to moment are generally consistent with
t
our way of being in those moments.  This is true for any way of be-
ing, such as annoyed, or sad, or loving, and the like.  For example,
when we are being angry we are also likely to find ourselves acting
angrily, and when we are being confident we are likely to be acting
confidently.  It is clear that when we are being angry, or confident,
or annoyed, or sad or loving, our actions are likely to be consistent
with that way of being.
Note that we have said that our actions are virtually always
consistent with our
t
way of being (what is going on with us inter-
nally).  And that is all that can be verified in our experience (in our
consciousness).  We can have theories about some additional con-
nection or relation between our way of being and our actions, but
there is no proof (evidence) of any further connection or relation
between our way of being and our way of acting other than that
they are consistent with each other.
t
However, we must note that most people go through life and
act in life as though what is going on with them internally (some
combination of their mental state, emotional state, bodily state,
and their thoughts and memories) causes their actions.  But there
is no scientific evidence for believing in such a causal connection.
All we can say about the relationship between our way of being
and acting is that they are mutually arising or co-arising.  In fact,
during the course we will present neuroscience research (Clancey
1993; Libet 1999; Hawkins 2004; Soon 2008; Haggard 2009; Kandel
2009; Bode 2011; Wolpert 2011; Zimmer 2013 and Buckner 2013)
that is contrary to the belief that what is going on with you inter-
nally causes your actions.  For now, the following quotes from
neuroscientist Sam Harris (2012) summarize in everyday lan-
guage the research about the connection between what is going
on with you internally (in this case, your decision or intention) and
y
your action:
420
SPEAKING BEING
ILLIANA
You mean, whatever comes?
WES
Yeah. Take what you get and call that “attention.” Someone looks over at me, “great. That’s
attention.” And then get along with my work. Not like “They didn’t look long enough. That
must mean I’m not okay.” Swirling around in your racket. Who cares if you didn’t get attention?
Produce some results. And then you’ll die.
(laughter)r
ILLIANA
I want to ask a question. I would like to fi t my racket with what you are saying.
WES
Where is the “unfi t”?
(after Illiana asks Wes to read the board once more)
“I want to go the beach, but I don’t have any time.” That’s a problem.
ILLIANA
So that’s the “but”: “I want to get attention, but I don’t want to ask for it.”
WES
Great. That’s a problem, right?
ILLIANA
Right.
WES
Let’s shift it: It’s a lie. It’s a racket.
ILLAINA
Okay.
WES
Tell the truth about it. “I want to get attention and I’m afraid to ask for it.”
ILLIANA (smiling)
And I’m afraid to ask for it. So the “but” is creating the problem.
Some moments before you are aware of what
you will do next—a time in which you subjec-
tively appear to have complete freedom to
behave however you please—your brain has
already determined what you will do.  You
then become conscious of this “decision” and
believe that you are in the process of making
it. (9)
The intention to do one thing and not another
does not originate in consciousness—rather, it
appears in consciousness. . . . (8)
“
Fact Two
And, perhaps even less obvious is that both our way of being and
our actions (arising together consistent with each other) is correlat-
ed with—is naturally, necessarily, closely connected with; or more
d
poetically, in-a-dance-with—the way in which what we are dealing
with occurs or shows up for us.  In short, our way of being and act-
ing is a natural correlate of (in-a-dance-with) the way what we are
dealing with occurs for us.  For example, if the way a situation we
are dealing with occurs or shows up for us as threatening, our way
of being and acting is likely to be a natural correlate of (in-a-dance-
with) the situation occurring or showing up for us as threatening.
On the other hand, if the way a situation we are dealing with occurs
or shows up for us as an opportunity to excel, our way of being and
acting is likely to be correlated with the situation
d
occurring for us
as an opportunity to excel.
In summary, our actions are merely consistent with our
t
way of
being—that is, our actions are likely consistent with some combi-
nation of our mental state, emotional state, bodily state, and our
thoughts and memories; but our actions are not caused by these
d
aspects of what is going on with us internally.
Forum Day Four: Session Two
421
WES
You see that?
ILLIANA (nodding and smiling)
Yes.
WES
Yeah. This is a woman who just got the lie in her life. Why you’re driven to the “but” is your
racket. You’ll fi nd yourself taking things and putting “but” between them. Opposing them from
your racket. You’ll have to train yourself in telling the truth.
ILLIANA
The “but” makes it fi ghting. “And” is making peace.
WES
Yes! Very good!
ILLIANA
Thank you.
(applause)
Paul stood up again, the participant who can speak several languages and who struggled to get the
distinction “being inauthentic” during Session Two of Day One.
PAUL
I see something now about having my foot nailed to the floor. When you were going around
there: I saw myself one day going around in my living room in a circle, and it just cracked
me up that I did that. What’s come out of it, I sat there wanting to go into real estate, and
wanting to have a career in real estate, but I don’t know if I should because I... “I’m not re-
ally good at this, I don’t understand it. I really should go to school. But school takes a lot of
money and I don’t have a lot of money and I hate my job. And I hate my job because I can’t
make a lot of money.” It just kept going and going and going. What’s funny is that it led to
me coming here, because I got that everything, this all is going to collapse and I’ll be dead.
If I don’t do something about it, or do something, it’ll be the end of me. Not only that, I can
see how I’ve done this with other things I love in my life, like music, that I’ve completely
talked myself right out of it. It’s something I wanted to do but I started too late. I’m not
a great technician and I don’t have all these things. And I eventually lost sight of the fact
that I just like making music. Instead of just being in that making music I’ve gotten tangled
up in all the little piddly details and it became a racket after a while. And it kept me from
dealing with the fact that I have to practice if I want to make it, and I didn’t want to. Now it
is so easy to see it. Now I’d like to get home and play.
You can confirm facts 1 and 2 for yourself by checking them
out in your own experience.  Regarding fact 1:  Is your way of being
at this moment—that is, some combination of your attitude, and
your feelings, plus your body sensations, and your thoughts and
memories regarding what you are dealing with—consistent with
t
your way of acting in this moment?  Or more pointedly, is your way
of being and way of acting consistent with each other, virtually
arising as one thing?
And then, fact 2:  Is your way of being and acting (arising as
though one thing) correlated with (closely connected with) the
way what you are dealing with occurs or shows up for you?  And,
has that been essentially true in situations you have dealt with in
the past?  (For those of you who are tempted to do so, don’t stop
at understanding the text of what we said; rather, take the time to
actually check it out in your own as-lived experience.)
d
In summary:  Our way of being and acting is correlated with
d
(naturally, necessarily, closely connected with; in-a-dance-with)
the way in which what we are dealing with occurs for us.
During the course everything in this section will be gone over
and made clear for you so that you can confirm its validity in your
own lived experience.  In addition, the critical importance for being
a leader and the eff ective exercise of leadership of what has been
covered in this section will be dealt with in depth during the in-
class sessions of the course.
A Fact about the Way in which what we are
Dealing With Occurs for us
When we go through life such that who we are is whatever we are
referring to when we say “I” or “me” (which is the way we usually
do go through life), there is a background for the way in which life,
d
living, and self occur for us.  That is, when who we are for ourselves
r
is what we are referring to when we say “I” or “me,” this back-
ground (or we could say “environment”) for the way in which life,

I’ve been sitting here thinking about my problems, and there’s a lot of them.

All the problems you have in your languaging.
DOREL
In my languaging.

You see the diff erence between those? There are no problems in your life, are there?
DOREL

KIPP
Be careful about this creation business. They live in the conversation you are. There are no
problems out there. Your dog never has any problems. And when you say you have a lot of
problems in your life, you’re saying there’s this “life” someplace that contains these problems;
the problems are in your conversations. Languaging.
DOREL
One of the things I got was that I get easily upset and angry.

You’re kidding. How did you get in here? He gets easily upset? Angry?

living, and self occur for us,
r
colors and shapes that occurring.  We
term this background or environment for the way life, living, and
self occur:  “mood.”  The occurring is in the foreground and the
d
mood is in the
d
background coloring and shaping the
d
occurring in
the foreground.  During the in-class sessions of the course we will
clarify and fully deal with what is introduced in this paragraph.  At
this point, the only thing there is to get about what is said in this
paragraph is that there is this something called “mood,” and mood
is distinct from and diff erent than what is meant by “clearing,” a
term you will encounter in the next section.
The “Fundamental and Essential Nature and
Function of Being for Human Beings” in Contrast
to One’s “Way of Being”
There is a difference between the fundamental and essential
nature of “being” for human beings, and any person’s individual
moment-to-moment particular “way of being.”
t
We are sometimes aware of our particular moment-to-mo-
ment way of being, but we human beings so take for granted
that we exist (that we
t
are), that we give no thought to the actual
nature and function of being for us human beings (unless it is to
think about the time when we won’t be at all).  As a result, getting
clear about the fundamental and essential nature and function of
being for human beings (as contrasted with our individual mo-
ment-to-moment way of being) will be somewhat challenging.
Being for human beings (that is, the fundamental and essen-
tial nature of being for human beings) is “being the clearing” (the
possibility, or something like, the emptiness or nothingness) in
which life, living, and self occur or
r
show up for us.  What shows up
in the clearing that we are is all of it, the entire “state of the world.”
All of it, our entire “state of the world”—includes physical objects
and non-physical entities of every kind (and their properties and
in various relationships), other people (and their properties and in

various relationships), and we ourselves (and our properties and in
various relationships), along with the spatiality of here and there,
and the temporality of the past, the present, and the future.
The “ourselves” that shows up in the clearing that we are, is
that to which we refer when we say “I” or “me”—that is, our partic-
ular way of being in this or that moment, or our sense of ourselves
(our identity or persona).  You can confirm this by noticing that you
(as the clearing you are) are capable of being aware of yourself as
whatever it is that you are referring to when you say “I” or “me,”
and the at-the-moment way of being of that “I” or “me.”  In other
words, what you refer to when you say “I” or “me” shows up for
you in the clearing that you fundamentally and essentially are.
We note here that a drawback with the phrase the clearing
that we are is that it seems to imply subjectivity, and it is definitely
not meant in that way.  We will clarify and fully develop this during
t
the in-class sessions of the course.
Saying all this in other words:  Being for human beings (the
fundamental and essential nature of being for human beings)
is always and only, as philosopher Martin Heidegger so brilliantly
nailed it, “being in the world” (Being and Time). While we
generally think of being as something located “in here,” if you
take a careful look you will see that you are always being with
something or being about something, that is, always being in
t
the world (even if the part of the world you are being with is that
thing you refer to when you say “I” or “me” or the way of being
of “I” or “me”).
You can confirm for yourself that being for you is being in the
world, that you are so to speak a clearing for it all, in that when you
are conscious, you are always conscious of something or conscious
about something (even if what you are conscious of in a given mo-
ment is being conscious).  In other words, for human beings what
it is to be is for the world, all of it (our entire “state of the world”) to
show up (to occur).
Our moment to moment way of being is not the fundamental
t
and essential nature of being for us human beings.  When we are
being the clearing for life to show up, and our “I” or “me” self is

KIPP
Right. If it takes fi fteen minutes, then it takes fi fteen minutes. And that’s the whole story. Get
your car. Life is hard. And then you die. They throw dirt over your face, and that happens
whether you get your car or not, whether you get it in two or fi fteen minutes.
DOREL (smiling)
I am just a goddamned bitcher and complainer in life. I get upset and angry and I bitch and
bitch and bitch and bitch.
KIPP
That’s right.
DOREL
So that’s the thing with me.
KIPP
Yeah. It’s interesting. You’re so honest in your speaking, it contributes to everybody in the room
a lot, Dorel. Your authenticity is powerfully contributing. It’s real. Makes a big diff erence for
people. I was leading The Forum in London, and during the evening session after the four days,
a man stood and shared that his younger son came to him: “Daddy Daddy, Johnny hit me.” “Uh
huh.” “But Daddy, you don’t understand, he hit me in the same place as before, where it really
hurt!” “Uh huh.” “But Daddy, Johnny’s older and you said before he should know better not
to hit me.” “Uh huh.” “Daddy, I don’t want you to go back to that seminar anymore because it
makes you stupid!”
(laughter)r
DOREL (laughing)
Am I going to be stupid?
KIPP
Yes. What’s going to be stupid is: It’s going to take fi fteen minutes to get your car when it takes
fi fteen minutes. And when you’re lost, you’ll be lost. And that’s life, yes? You don’t have to add
simply one of the things that shows up in the clearing, that leaves
us free to be and free to act in life—free to be and free to act with
whatever we are dealing with in any situation.   This is critical for
being a leader and exercising leadership eff ectively as one’s natu-
ral self-expression; and during the in-class sessions of the course
access to this fundamental and essential nature of being for us
human beings will be made available to you.
As was the case with the previous section (Section 2), during
the course everything in this section will be gone over and made
clear for you so that you can confirm its validity for yourself in
your own lived experience.  In addition, the critical importance of
what has been covered in this section for being a leader and the
eff ective exercise of leadership as your natural self-expression will
be dealt with in depth during the in-class sessions of the course. ■

all that other stuff  to it. As a matter of fact, when you’re lost, you could discover something. But
when you’re lost and angry, you’re too busy being angry to fi nd out anything beyond being lost
and angry. Anything else?
DOREL
No. Thank you.
KIPP
Well done. Thank you very much.
WES
Wait a second, Kipp. Just to complete this: You have to deal with your own listening to this
conversation. Consider the possibility that you are listening to the conversation about problems
like it would help you solve them. See that? It’s listening to this like “Oh, here’s new stuff  to help
me solve my problems.” That’s more of the same. This conversation is intended to create a new
clearing for problems, which clearing will alter you and the problems in life. That’s the intention.
If you were looking at Illiana’s face, she got a new clearing for this whole thing about attention.
She still needs attention. She still has a racket. Still has the same job. But the occurrence “atten-
tion” occurs in a new clearing. This clearing will give her the opportunity to make new requests.
See, she’s never tried out being straight with people about giving her attention. Like...
(to Illiana, who is sitting)
“Would you give me some attention? Let’s stop for fi ve minutes. I’m producing great results. I
want you to listen to what happened to me today. Would you be willing to do that?” The racket
is to do it and have a problem with doing it. Now you can just do it. By the way, this attention
thing has something else behind it.
(to the group)
The point is that there’s a possibility for you and your problems to relate diff erently. A new
clearing. You don’t have to remember any of this. No, there’s one thing you have to remember:
Your problems are part of your racket and your racket stinks. That’s all you need to remember.
That’ll create a new clearing for you.
At 3:30, Kipp asked participants to stand up and stretch and then sit back down.
KIPP
When you come into life from empty and meaningless, and you’re able to be with your racket,
what opens up for you is choice. However, you don’t know anything about choice. So we’re
going to spend some time distinguishing choice as choice. So when you say you’re going to do
something and you want to do it, you say what? You go out and make a what? A decision, yes?
You say something like “I made a decision to do this.” First of all, we want to get choice and
decision distinct. The word “decide” comes from the same family as suicide, matricide, and
426
SPEAKING BEING
patricide and all the cides—meaning to kill. Decide means to kill or murder the alternative. So
when you decide something you are destroying the alternative. “I’ve decided to do that!” That’s
a decision—based on something. “I’m deciding this because...” It’s always based on something.
What gives a decision is it’s based on something. Choice is not based on something. It’s based
on no thing or nothing. Choice is to select freely and after consideration, not limited by what-
ever the evidence that you have to give for a decision. The fi rst thing we need to do is to get
a decision to be a decision and a choice to be a choice so that they can live distinctly for you.
When you say choose, what you mean for the most part is decide. What you’re actually saying
is decide. We’re going to do a little demonstration with someone to distinguish a choice from a
decision, so you can see it clearly for yourself, so you can see a choice in action.
Kipp asked for a volunteer who has not taken The Forum before, nor seen the demonstration. The
participant chosen was Bill, the young man who had interacted so combatively with Erhard during
Session One of Day One of The Forum.
KIPP (continuing)
Are you willing to do this demonstration, to stay with it all the way through, keep participating,
even if it looks like it might be frustrating for you and you might not get it, and go right to the
end and keep on playing?
BILL (smiling)
Couldn’t look any worse than I did on the fi rst day. So yeah, I’m willing.
KIPP
That’s true.
(laughter: to the group)
Okay, so. All right. Now, your job is not to coach Bill. A lot of the time when you are sitting in
your chair and you don’t have whatever it is that you have when you’re standing there attempt-
ing to get it sorted out for yourself, where it’s sometimes a little more diffi  cult to see, so don’t
say it out loud, or coach him in some way. Let him struggle with it because it’s the inquiry into
the distinction, the struggle that will bring forth the distinction. We’re not defi ning a distinc-
tion; we’re not explaining a distinction. We’re not describing choice. We want to see choice as a
distinction in action. So Bill, I’m going to ask you to make a simple choice, and each time I ask
you to make a choice, you’ll say to me, “I choose...” whatever you chose, “because...” And you’ll
fi ll in whatever comes after that for you, okay? You clear how to respond? Okay ready?
BILL
Yeah.
Kipp held out two hands as if he had an ice cream cone in each one.
KIPP (continuing)

KIPP (to Bill)
Chocolate or vanilla: Choose.
BILL (pointing at the hand representing chocolate
(
)
I choose chocolate... because I prefer the fl avor.
KIPP
Perfect. Okay, so, “I chose chocolate because I prefer the fl avor.” That’s a perfect decision,
because what selected the chocolate was what? What did the selecting?
BILL
I did.
KIPP
Well, if you really look at it, the reason, the thought, the consideration—“because I prefer
the flavor better”—came along, right?
BILL
Yeah.
KIPP (pulling a tissue out of a tissue box)
Like this little thought—peep!—comes along...
(dangling the tissue in the air)r
“I prefer the fl avor of chocolate better.”
(pointing at the tissue
(
)
And that reason, that consideration, that thought, selected the chocolate, didn’t it? Not you.
That’s what the selection was based on, wasn’t it?
BILL
Yeah.
KIPP
That’s a decision because it’s based on something. Perfect! That’s what your job is up here, so
everybody can see a decision as a decision, and a choice as a choice. Okay, ready?
(holding out his hands again to Bill)
Chocolate or vanilla: Choose.
428
SPEAKING BEING
BILL
Chocolate.
KIPP
Perfect! Now why’d you choose chocolate?
BILL (after a long pause)
I chose chocolate...
KIPP
Because...
BILL
If I put a because in there it’ll be a decision...
KIPP
We did this before, it works...
(laughter)r
“I chose chocolate because...”
BILL
I chose chocolate... because it’s black. I don’t know.
KIPP
Perfect! So, along came this thought...Peep!
(pulling another tissue from the box and dangling it
(
)
“Because it’s black.” And what did the selecting was the reason, the feeling, the thought, the
consideration, the evidence, the something did the selecting, not you. So that’s a clear-cut deci-
sion.
BILL
How do I get out of this?
KIPP
You keep inquiring, just like you’re doing. You’re doing perfectly. Okay? Ready to go again?
BILL
Yeah.
Forum Day Four: Session Two
429
KIPP
Chocolate or vanilla: Choose.
BILL
Vanilla.
KIPP
Vanilla! Perfect! Why did you choose vanilla? “I chose...”
BILL (to laughter)r
Can you give me a hint?
KIPP
A choice is to select freely and after consideration... “I chose...”
BILL
I chose vanilla because I want to experiment with a new taste.
KIPP
Perfect! So along came a thought—peep!...
(pulling another tissue out of the box
(
)
“because I want to experiment with a new taste,” right? And “because I want to experiment
with a new taste” selected vanilla, and not you: That’s a clear-cut decision because it’s based on
the reason, the feeling, the consideration, the thought...
(holding many tissues)
See we’re starting to get “the mind” built here. This is what the mind is made up of, all those
things, those thoughts, those feelings, those considerations. And you’re doing great, training
everyone in the room in these distinctions. I know it may not feel that way to you, but you’re
doing great. Ready?
The demonstration continued, with Bill selecting a fl avor after Kipp presented the choice: because
he only had two choices; because it’s there; because he decided to, etc. At each juncture Bill reiter-
ated his complaint that he knew the problem (how to make a choice using the word because, when
using because leads to making a decision) but that he didn’t know how to get out of it.
BILL
I chose because I exhausted all my reasons.
KIPP
So the reason—peep!
430
SPEAKING BEING
KIPP (pulling another tissue out of the box
(
)
“I’ve exhausted all my reasons” is a reason. It doesn’t sound like a reason, but it’s a reason. And
so the selection of chocolate was once again based on a reason. It was based on something; a
choice is based on nothing, except you saying so. Chocolate, vanilla: choose!
BILL
Vanilla.
KIPP
Perfect! Why did you choose vanilla?
BILL
I chose vanilla because I decided to...
(Kipp pulls out another tissue, wafting it will a string of “peeps”)”
Because I chose to.
KIPP
Okay, okay. Let’s check it out again. Chocolate or vanilla: choose!
BILL
Chocolate.
KIPP
Perfect! Why did you choose chocolate?
BILL (hesitating)
I have to use because?
KIPP
Yes.
BILL (to laughter)r
I don’t see any way to develop from this.
KIPP
Right. You’re distinctioning something. You’re distinguishing something, and you’re doing
great. Chocolate or vanilla: choose!
BILL
Chocolate.
Forum Day Four: Session Two
431
KIPP
Perfect! Why did you choose chocolate?
BILL
I chose chocolate... because I enjoy choosing chocolate.
KIPP (pulling out another tissue to a elongated “peep!”
(
)”
“I enjoy” is like a feeling, a thought, a consideration, a reason, isn’t it? It’s based on your enjoy-
ment. That reason came along and selected it again.
BILL
I do not know how to make a choice without... with using the word because. I must have missed
something.
KIPP
You didn’t miss anything. They are real glad it’s you up here, not them.
(applause)
When you come from life is empty and meaningless and you’re able to be with your racket,
choice opens up for you, but you don’t know anything about choice. Why we are working this
way is to distinguish something called choice, and a choice is based on nothing: It’s a pure
choice, simply because you choose. Chocolate/Vanilla: choose!
BILL (fi nally
(
)
I choose chocolate simply because I choose... chocolate.
The participants erupted in applause.
KIPP
The important thing is all his reasons, thoughts, feelings considerations, are still there, weren’t
they? See, you think you have to get rid of these...
(holding up all the tissues he had pulled out of the box)
In order to make a choice. No. They are all still there, except his choice isn’t based on these.
He has his reasons, his thoughts, his feelings, his considerations, but he’s not being those. He’s
being his choice. You think you have to get rid of all these, then you can make a choice. Yes?
BILL
I thought that way. I think that way.
432
SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
So far that’s what’s been available for you, is you thinking that this is what you got for your life,
yes? If you can get enough of these lined up in one way or the other, it will give you the action
that you want.
BILL
Yes.
KIPP
Exactly. What’s been missing for you is the distinction choice, for you “Bill,” and for you “human
being.” It doesn’t come with being human. You don’t come equipped with that one. You’ve got to
invent that one. You want to test this now to make sure you and everybody else is clear about it?
BILL
Sure.
KIPP
Bill, why is the fl oor down there?
BILL (looking down)
It’s just there?
KIPP
It’s where? The fl oor is down there because...?
BILL (laughing)
It doesn’t choose to be there. That’s for sure.
KIPP
Good, Bill. So...?
BILL
Because it’s there.
KIPP
Where? The fl oor is down there because...?
BILL
Because the fl oor is down there.
KIPP
Let’s check this out a bit more.
Forum Day Four: Session Two
433
KIPP (pointing up
(
)
Bill, why is the ceiling up there?
BILL
Because it’s up there.
KIPP (pointing at a participant
(
)
But Bill, why is Ashley like that?
BILL
Because Ashley’s like that.
KIPP (pointing at another participant
(
)
Wait a second Bill, why is John like that?
BILL
Because John is like that.
KIPP
Yeah, but Bill, what is the sound of one hand clapping?
BILL (to laughter)r
I’ve heard this one before...
He took a long time mulling over this, trying various answers: “it’s nonexistent,” “there is no sound,”
etc. Kipp repeated the prompts for the fl oor and the ceiling, and then returning to the sound of one
hand clapping.
BILL (to laughter)r
It can’t manifest a sound. It must have something to do with the fl oor and the ceiling.
KIPP
Human beings love logic. It’s all got to be logical. Right? What is the sound of one hand clap-
ping?
BILL
There is no sound.
KIPP
Where you are looking there is no sound. But the sound of one hand clapping is what? It’s
simply what?
