Forum Day Four: Session Three 463
(laughter)
KIPP (to the group)
Are you starting to see how much room you have in life to be? Every conversation, you’re gone. 
You are a Velcro ball.
WANDA
I’m sharing this to see the decisions I’ve made and how they have run me. And what I decided 
at that point was to never allow my family to stop me in my career. I was sharing this with her 
during dinner and she said, “This is too painful, I don’t want to talk about this.” My point in 
sharing this is that without this Forum we wouldn’t have had the breakthrough we did have. At 
one point I fi nally said, “Mom, the only way you and I and the rest of the children will be freed 
is to talk about it like ‘that’s what’s so,’ rather than to suppress it.”
KIPP
Think back to the conversation we were just having a few minutes ago. In the real-life sense, 
these are the conversations he was talking about choosing, like those, the ones that are there to 
talk about. 
WANDA
So at that point she asked me for some coaching—she’d never asked for that before...
KIPP
You had not been available for that before. It’s not that she never asked you: You’ve never been 
there, available.
WANDA
So we started sharing about the experience. She acknowledged that the experience was 
painful for her. The first time she had ever acknowledged that and that it might have been 
painful for us as children growing up around that. She had not been willing to confront 
that with us.
KIPP (correcting her) 
She hadn’t said that. 
WANDA
Right. Well, I hadn’t been willing to confront it either... 
KIPP (correcting again, getting her out of the story into the what happened)
You hadn’t said that... 
WANDA
We did share it. It looked like what was coming across was that she didn’t do a good job.
