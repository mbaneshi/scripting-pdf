Forum Day Three: Session One

stand back a bit and watch it think. You think you’re limited to what it thinks. But that’s it
thinking. It has thought you into a lot of pain and suff ering, unhappiness, and dissatisfaction.
And it has a purpose, like a machine. It is designed in-order-to. It is not designed in order
to leave you with love, fulfi llment, and full self-expression. Have you got any idea what it’s
designed in-order-to? It’s designed in order to make you look good. That’s its design function.
(in the aisle among the group)
And it uses thinking and feeling, interpretations, what you believe to be true, in order to make
you look good. It utilizes and organizes those elements and generates those elements in a form
designed to make you look good. What does it mean to look good? Well, specifi cally, it means
to make you right and others wrong, to foster your dominating and to avoid the domination
of anything else. And it uses your thinking and your feelings, and your perceptions and your
interpretations, conclusions, etc., to justify yourself; except yourself and it have become one.
You have identifi ed with it. You are an it; you are an anybody. What makes you an anybody
is you identify with it. You identify with its thinking and its feeling, and that makes you an
anybody, and the costs are love, happiness, and self-expression. It thinks and you have its
thoughts, and it thinks in order to make you look good, and what it costs you to identify with it
is love, happiness, vitality, and self-expression.
BETTY
I think the thing that hit me the strongest was the racket. When I could identify my racket and
my reason for allowing things to take place in my life and receive the cost that I received from it,
was the identifi cation of breaking through the barrier of all of this. I felt like this ton of bricks
was lifted from my shoulders, being able to acknowledge that. And I realize what I was doing...
ERHARD
See—hold on. It doesn’t think like that. What she’s speaking doesn’t have anything to do with
looking good, does it? As a matter of fact if you were real concerned with looking good you
would never say what she just said. You can’t say what she just said without thinking, because it
might make you look bad. Go on.
BETTY
I realized the cost that I was paying for the racket I was having.
ERHARD
Running. You run a racket.
BETTY
The racket I was running. In allowing myself to be used for acceptance.
ERHARD
Kipp and I may have to go home and let her do this. That’s extraordinarily powerful to
recognize that your life doesn’t belong to you. That it’s using your life for its purposes. And its
confronted as the “it” which we have been sent, becomes “us.”
The “giant cybernetic system,” to use Hubert Dreyfus’ s phrase,
has thereby been set in motion: “We don’t produce the clearing.
The clearing produces us” (“Gaining a Free Relationship to
Technology,” Applied Heidegger Conference).
We have become both the “it” which acts in-order-to, and, as
the they-self/identity, one of those entities which is subject to the
in-order-to of the “it.” Erhard has summarized the result of this
system:
“
When you are that you are the identity “I”—when
you are that you are that—and you couple that
with what “it” is up to, you get a very powerful
look into how this what-it’s-up-to is translated
into our everyday way of Being-in-the-world,
into our everyday engagement with our everyday
concerns. What “it” is concerned with, once
you are that you are it. . . what “it” is up to is
making you right. . . and making anything else by
contrast wrong. (“The Heart of the Matter”)
In Being and Time, the in-order-to is also shown by Heidegger
to be a central element of the existential structure of Dasein. As we
have shown elsewhere, Dasein is always in the world in such a way
that it is concerned about things—getting them done, producing
d
them, giving them up, considering them, and so forth (BT 83–84,
T
96)—and our understanding of the world is mediated through
these concerns (see the sidebar “Concern” during Session Four
of Day One). Heidegger calls the things we encounter in this way
equipment, and in-order-to is a characteristic of equipment:
“
Equipment is essentially ‘something in-order-
to. . . .’ A totality of equipment is constituted
by various ways of the ‘in-order-to,’ such
as serviceability, conduciveness, usability,
manipulability. [. . .] Dealings with equipment
subordinate themselves to the manifold
assignments of the ‘in-order-to.’ (BT 97, 98)

SPEAKING BEING
purposes are looking good--all that stuff  up on the board specifi cally--that’s what looking good
looks like: being right, making other people and other things wrong, dominating, avoiding
domination, justifying yourself and invalidating others, and other things. When you come to see
that that’s what your life is being used for, you’ve gotten pretty close to the source of your self.
You’ve gotten pretty close to the source of your identity. Pretty close to the source of that with
which you’ve confused your self. Go on.
BETTY
He was right that I allow myself to be used for acceptance. That was the cost that I was paying.
I didn’t enjoy the cost I was receiving. I made them wrong to be right when I was the one who
was wrong.
KIPP
Even though she didn’t enjoy the cost she was receiving, it was familiar. And what you call
comfortable is what is familiar, what you are used to. She doesn’t know now how to relate to her
brother. She knows how to relate to him before: make him wrong. But now she has to be in the
presence of the risk...
ERHARD
She’s got to make up a relationship with her brother. That’s called “invent.” She’s got to invent a
relationship with her brother. Another word for that is “create”: create a relationship with her
brother. You want to think about that a little bit: The possibility of living life as a creative act,
where you don’t have an answer when you stand in front of the canvas. What you’ve got is an
empty canvas, possibility. You create something in the empty space of not knowing how to be
there already. Knowing how to be there already is nothing more than the past coming around to
meet you in the future. Sure she knows how to relate to her brother that way she’s always been.
That’s comfortable. It’s uncomfortable to stand in front of an empty canvas. It’s uncomfortable
because you’re at risk. You might make a fool of yourself. You might be conned. You might get
taken advantage of. You don’t like that, visit the surgeon and get a lobotomy.
BETTY
It doesn’t just stop at my brother.
ERHARD
Obviously it doesn’t stop at your brother. Somebody who says “I hate, I hate, I hate”—that is
“disgruntled and unhappy” waiting-to-happen. Suppose she doesn’t have this as a way to start
every morning? Suppose she doesn’t have that as a way to walk into work? She’ll have to create
a way to walk into work, and create a way to walk into her relationships with her family, and
create a way to walk into relationships with men in her life—instead of being sour to start with
before anything happens.
BETTY
I stay sour constantly.
referentiality, a frame of reference for our understanding—a
“towards-which” for all of our/its dealings in the world. And the
primary towards-which, says Heidegger, is always the “for-the-
sake-of-which” that Dasein itself is: “the ‘for-the-sake-of’ always
pertains to the Being of Dasein, for which, in its Being, that very
Being is essentially an issue” (BT 116–117). My concerns and my
T
actions always circle back to my own Being, always defined by
the in-order-to: “In so far as Dasein exists factically, it understands
itself in the way its ‘for-the-sake-of-itself’ is thus connected with
some current ‘in-order-to’” (BT 416).
T
One of The Forum’s central purposes is the unconcealment
of the in-order-to, which is the design function of the “it”—the
calculative thinking which characterizes the technological clear-
ing. Erhard has pointed out that recognizing his own thrownness
to in-order-to was central in the development of his thinking.
During his 1971 experience of ontological insight, from which the
est Training was generated, he says:
t
“
I realized that I actually didn’t know anything. Ev-
erything that I knew had a tag on it, and the name
of the tag was “in order to.” So I knew this in order
to, I knew that in order to, et cetera. Everything
t
was somehow a part of a story about how it was
going to advance me or how it could be used, or
how it could benefit people, or whatever it might
be. Nothing lived on its own. (Simon  37)
As we will show in the closing Interval for Day Four of The Forum,
the danger of the technological clearing, for Heidegger, is that we
are oblivious to its nature and are thus denied access to the truth
of aletheia: “Through [the technological destining of enframing]
the other possibility is blocked,” said Heidegger, that human
being “might rather be admitted sooner and ever more primally
to the essence of what is unconcealed and to its unconcealment
[aletheia]” (“QCT” in BW 331).
