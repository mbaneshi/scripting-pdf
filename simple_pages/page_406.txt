SPEAKING BEING
WES
There are two things there: fully participating and getting excited.
DAVID
Getting really excited about the projects I’m involved in.
WES
“I do projects. I’m not excited. That’s a problem for me.” Is that how it goes?
DAVID
Yes.
WES
See the languaging there?
DAVID
Yes.
WES
That’s where the problem is.
DAVID
Thank you.
WES
You’re welcome.
(laughter; David sits)
So now that we’ve put it into the domain of languaging, we have some access to them. If you can
locate problems where they are, that is to say, in languaging, you now have an access to dealing 
with problems that will allow for a breakthrough in problems. We’re now going to deal with the 
real breakthrough in problems. This is what you all need to get is the next thing I deal with. I 
deal with a little bit more, but this is it. You want to fi nd the specifi c box... I want you to imagine: 
Languaging has many boxes. Make believe: Many boxes in languaging; many possibilities for 
things to occur in within languaging. We want to fi nd the specifi c box that problems occur in. 
Problems occur in one box only for human beings. It doesn’t show up as a box, because people
think their problems are “out there,” shows up like “out there.” But now that you know that it
shows up in a box in languaging, we have to fi nd the box. Knowing the box will give us some 
power with regard to our problems. It’ll actually blow the whole thing open. 
Wes moved to the chalkboard, drew a square, and wrote “problems” inside it.
