Forum Day Three: Session Four

ERHARD
Hold on a second. You notice he didn’t say he was confused. You want to listen that he’s
saying the same things a lot of other people have said in here. Talking about not quite getting
something yet. But he’s talking about it, he has framed it, he’s construed it, he’s spoken it so that
there’s an opening for him to get it. Rather than a way that there is no opening for him to get it
so that Kipp has to beat him up to get him to get it.
FRED
So what I was looking at, the possibility that empty and meaningless, if we had the opposite
of that, if life was full and fulfi lling there would be no space for me to come up, to express
myself, to be fully blown as a human being, in the sense that I would be spending all my time
trying to fi nd out what’s the meaning of life if it’s already so full? I’m looking at empty and
meaninglessness as a place to start from like it’s empty, it’s open.
ERHARD
Here’s the problem in that. It’s one of the problems Kipp and I have in leading The Forum.
This empty and meaningless you’ve got to get just like it is. You can’t get it as a place to start.
If you’re getting it like a place to start you’re getting it in-order-to. You’ve got to kill hope.
Otherwise your life is going to be full of hopelessness. See the one thing that goes away with
hope... When you suff er the pain of getting rid of hope, the other thing that goes away with it
is “hopeless.” We’re going to get a little deeper into this business about empty and meaningless
and take a look at what the structure is. If it’s all empty and meaningless then how did all this
crap happen? Everyone’s seen enough crap to be clear about the amount of crap there is? We
don’t need to do more crap in here?
Erhard stopped to acknowledge a participant for how diff erent she looked from the fi rst day.
ERHARD (continuing)
In Fred’s straight talk about it, I want you to get that you’ve got to get it just to get it, not in-
order-to. See if there’s an iota of getting out of the trap in your getting it, you didn’t get it. You
gotta go through the despair, you gotta go through whatever emotion you have, or whatever
mood you’ve got about it. You’ve got to get it cleanly. You can’t get it knowing that there’s going
to be a way out, because the way out is the way in. See if you get it knowing there’s going to be a
way out, you didn’t get it because you got it in a way that’s going to keep you in. I had forgotten
who I was talking to over here in the last session, what I said, that the attempt to get out of the
trap... you know, what makes Californians silly is their attempt to get out of the trap, because
the attempt to get out of the trap is being in the trap. What it is to be in the trap is to try to get
out of the trap. You can’t get out if you try, because trying to get out is part of the trap. You read
the right books, and they tell you that. Okay, so you fi gure, I’m going to give up trying to get out
of the trap. Well, that’s part of the trap. See, you can’t get out if you try, because trying to get
out is being in the trap. And you can’t get out if you don’t try. There’s no getting out of the trap.
There’s no way to win this game; you can’t beat this one. You’ve got to be able to be in the trap.
Every one of those words was chosen very carefully. You should listen to them very rigorously.
Giving up, surrendering to the trap: won’t work. All that’ll do is leave you in the trap. Trying to

SPEAKING BEING
get out of the trap won’t work because the trap is constructed in such a way that the attempts to
get out are the very bars of the trap. That’s what keeps you in the trap. You can’t get out if you
try, and you can’t get out if you don’t try. You’ve got to be able to be in the trap. You know, you
can’t write that. That’s oral. If you read it, it sounds like I said you’ve got to be able to be in the
trap. No. I said you’ve got to be able to be in the trap. You’ve got to fi nd freedom in the ropes:
full, total, absolute freedom in the ropes. You’ve got to fi nd freedom in your asshole-ness. Find
freedom in the racket. Not avoiding the racket, not running the racket, not indulging yourself
in the racket. “Okay, I’ll just do my racket.” That’s trapped. You’ve just surrendered to it, given
up to the racket. Trying not to do your racket will just be a new racket, even if you succeed at it,
which you probably won’t. Very, very rarely do people succeed at not doing their racket, and if
you did succeed that would just be your new racket. Your new racket would be not doing your
racket. Lots of people around here like that. They’re Enlightened. You’re the kind of people who
fall in holes or get hit by busses. So, no in-order-to. It’s empty and meaningless. And it’s empty
and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless. It doesn’t mean anything that it doesn’t
mean anything. It just doesn’t mean anything and it doesn’t mean anything that it doesn’t mean
anything. And it isn’t going to work out. It isn’t going to work out because it already worked out.
You think it’s going to work out someday. The right woman is not going to come along someday,
the one who’s blonde and naked on a horse. You’re gonna be stuck with the one you got. You
aren’t going to make it. There’s no making it. And you got plenty of evidence for that already. A
lot of people in this room have a lot of making it already. There are no failures in here. We could
go down the street and fi nd people whose lives are desperate due to their failures. Everyone
in here is pretty successful in dealing with life. You’re pretty stupid, but you’re successful at
dealing with life. We’ve made it this far despite our stupidity. Evidence that the stupid do make
it... At any rate... So no cheating. You can’t cheat your way out of this. You’ve got to lose and
then be able to be.
FRED
It looks like... I don’t know if that’s as far as I can take it. That’s what is. Like there’s no
supporting, no stuff  around it.
ERHARD
Yeah. It’s called the existential moment of truth: naked and without any support. You’ve got to
be able to be there. You’ve got to be able to be with nothing underneath you. You won’t make it.
You won’t make it in The Forum. It’ll take years for you to get that. Fred and I have been working
together a long time, pretty intensively. He’s a real good guy. It’s hard to tell when he talks about
himself. You don’t get it all when you open it up. We’re opening it up in here. This is kindergarten.
But it’s started. This is an experience over which you will never get. You’ll hear me talking for
years. What you’ll never get over is knowing that you’ve got a choice. I know you don’t know
what choice means yet, but you’ll never get over that. No matter how fucked up you get, that
you’ll never get over. Still lots of work to do. And you’ll do it if you see it as a privilege to do that
work.  If you can’t see what an extraordinary opportunity it is to do this work, then you ought
to complete The Forum and get every ounce of value you can get out of it, and there’s plenty
of value there to get, and you ought to go on your merry way. That’s a fair deal. You paid for it.
You’re not obligated to do anything; you haven’t joined anything because there’s nothing to join.
“
Giving up, surrendering to the trap: won’t
work. All that’ll do is leave you in the trap.
Trying to get out of the trap won’t work
because the trap is constructed in such a
way that the attempts to get out are the
very bars of the trap. That’s what keeps
you in the trap. You can’t get out if you
try, and you can’t get out if you don’t try.
You’ve got to be able to be in the trap.
