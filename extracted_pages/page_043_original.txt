 Forum Day One: Session One 29
Hesitantly, Bill sat down.
ERHARD
Do I take that to mean that you’ve chosen to be here?
BILL
Yes. 
ERHARD (to the group)
All Bill’s doing is doing you a favor. He’s letting you see yourself. That’s an extraordinary gift, 
to see yourself.
(turning back to Bill)
I want to apologize to you for saying things that you found off ensive. Do you accept my 
apology?
BILL
Yes, I do. 
ERHARD 
I’m not clear you’re here because you chose to be here.
BILL 
Yes. But I’m not clear if I’ll get the results.
 ERHARD
And you won’t be. How The Forum works is you learn nothing. And then you learn more noth-
ing. And then you learn it all at once. It’s an all of a sudden phenomenon. 
(pausing) 
What we just went through is very important. I brought something to that conversation that’s 
designed to leave you in a diff erent place about those conversations. I predict that when The
Forum is over you’ll tell me this was the most important experience in your whole life. We’ll
see. There’s a bit of a risk here, and I accept that.
Erhard fi nally left Bill, and addressed the group, moving among them.
ERHARD
Nobody participates in programs that I lead because they were pressured. A lot of people are 
here because they’ve got reasons to be here. And I want you to know you’re not here because 
of your reasons. You put yourself in that chair, and not your reasons. You’ve got a story called
force, and what actually happened was somebody spoke to you. If you live in a story called 
force, your life will look like a response to force. See, most of you live in response to a story you 
made up. You live in a sea of reasons. But I want you to be clear, you put yourself in that chair,
“
 If you live in a story called force, your life
will look like a response to force.
NOTE: Please see the final conversation Erhard has with Bill 
near the close of Session Three of Day Four.
