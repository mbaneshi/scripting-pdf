SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Do you think I give a shit that you’re tired? We’re talking about the rest of your
life and you’re sitting there complaining about being tired. That’s disgusting. 
You are disgusting.
(pausing: to the group)
Now that I’ve got your attention. . . 
(repeating the assignments) 
Let me leave you with a reminder. I have already gotten everything I need out
of this Forum. You have not. You need to be twice as powerful tomorrow. The 
way to be twice as powerful is to do these assignments. You gave your word
to be here on time tomorrow. Is that clear? You gave your word to be on time
tomorrow regardless of the circumstances, is that clear?
(to a participant who was standing at the back of the room preparing to leave)
What are you doing at the door with your hat and coat on? You need to be 
back in The Forum so we can end The Forum.
The participant returned to her seat in palpable silence.
ERHARD
Thank you.
The fi rst day of The Forum ended.
