Forum Day Three: Session One
187
JANE
Last summer at a camp.
ERHARD
What happened?
JANE
Everybody had to say their problem out in the open and I didn’t want to do it. They kept asking
over and over until I did.
ERHARD
Can you remember a time before that speaking in front of a group of people?
JANE
I didn’t.
ERHARD
What about in school?
JANE
I never talked in school. I sat in the back.
ERHARD
When were you frightened about standing up?
JANE
In the fourth grade.
ERHARD
What happened in the fourth grade?
JANE
Well my fi rst year of fourth grade I had to stay back. And most of the people—well this is my
story—made fun of me for staying back, and said I was stupid.
ERHARD
How do you do in school?
JANE
Fine. I get good grades.
ERHARD
Are you happy in school?
“
Our fundamental task now consists of awakening
a fundamental attunement in our philosophizing.
I deliberately say: in our philosophizing, not in
r
some arbitrary philosophizing nor even in phi-
losophy in itself, for there is no such thing. It is a
matter of awakening a fundamental attunement
which is to sustain our philosophizing, and not
the fundamental attunement. Accordingly, there
is not merely one single attunement, but several.
(FCM 59)
The task that Heidegger proposes is the distinguishing of the
fundamental attunements that, unrecognized, generate human
thinking. His purpose here is not to ascertain these attunements,
since that term implies objective knowing (i.e., the stance of a sub-
ject whose goal is to learn about something separate from itself),
but that I am never separate from my attunements:
“
Perhaps such a thing as the fundamental attune-
ment we are seeking is precisely something that
cannot be ascertained in this way by an inquiry. It
could be that it pertains to ascertaining an attune-
ment not merely that one has the attunement,
but that one is attuned in accord with it. (FCM 60,
M
emphasis added)
To know an attunement, then, requires
w
entering it.
Such inquiry makes a special demand of the inquirer, a
demand always present in ontological inquiry, and one that has
made scholarly or scientific studies of Werner Erhard’s work
problematic. Central to The Forum’s promise is the possibility of
choosing an authentic existence; but participants—even those
with scholarly credentials—cannot ascertain whether that result
has been produced by hearing about the experiences of others in
The Forum, or even by observing their behaviors. In this domain
of knowing, the evidence lies in one’s own lived experience; and to
further challenge scientific inquiry, it is in the nature of one’s lived
experience that what it means is up to you.

SPEAKING BEING
JANE
No.
ERHARD
Would you like to be happy in school?
JANE
Yeah. Well, I feel if I was happier about being in school I’d get better grades.
ERHARD
Okay. You’d also be happier in life.
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
What happened in the fourth grade?
JANE
The biggest thing I remember is I asked people to come to my birthday party, and no one
showed up for it.
ERHARD
What did you decide when nobody showed up?
JANE
That no one liked me.
ERHARD
I want you to be right there—back in the fourth grade. You didn’t merely decide “nobody likes
me.” You became “nobody likes me.” You’ve been living over top of “nobody likes me.” And
when nobody likes you, it’s threatening to stand up in front of a group. Do you get that?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Is it true that nobody likes you?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
How old are you when you’re in the fourth grade?
The scientific mind boggles; but these principles lie at the
heart of a phenomenological approach to knowing, such as those
of Heidegger and Erhard: you must yourself be fully available for
the outcome; and the insight of the transformational Augenblick is
that the meaning of my life is determined by the stand I take on it.
But I must first take a stand.

Attunements are already always there. I am never not attuned
in some way to the world; there is never a naked “I” which sub-
sequently becomes attuned. We are attuned from inception, but
without being conscious of our attunement. This is tricky territory.
“
We speak, aft er all, of the unconscious. In one re-
spect it is at hand, and yet in another respect it is
not at hand, namely insofar as it is not conscious.
This strange ‘at hand and yet at the same time not
at hand’ arises from the possibility of being con-
scious of something unconscious. (FCM 61)
M
Attunements live in the realm that Werner Erhard calls what we
don’t know that we don’t know. The Forum functions to unconceal
the “blind spots” that constitute this realm.
“
The distinction between not being there [Nicht-
Dasein] in the sense of the unconscious and being
there [Dasein] in the sense of what is conscious
also seems to be equivalent to what we have in
mind by awakening, specifically by the awakening
of whatever is sleeping.
(FCM 61)
M
Therefore Heidegger begins with a proposal that attunements are
sleeping, and we want them awake so that they can be dealt with,
and their influence on our world can be perceived. “Awakening
means to make something wakeful. . . .  To awaken an attunement
means, aft er all, to let it become awake and as such precisely to let
it be” (FCM 60).
