SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
You have no idea: she struggles with being on time.
MARY
Yeah.
ERHARD
So now it’s okay with him.
(laughter)
JAKE
I believe that people’s intentions are important. Let’s take a poll.
ERHARD
If we took a poll 100 years ago, somebody in here would be burned as a witch.
JAKE
That’s true.
Another participant, Paul, spoke up while remaining seated.
PAUL
In some languages making promises sometimes involves using a special tense that says you
might not arrive.
ERHARD  (laughing)
When I arrive, if I do...
PAUL
It’s characteristic of other languages. In Spanish there’s all these subjunctive tenses. You can
say: “When you do this for me, then I’ll do that.” It’s subjunctive, it’s something we don’t recog-
nize in our language. It’s recognized as theoretical. Maybe that’s what you’re getting at.
ERHARD
No it’s not, but what you’ve said is useful nevertheless for what I am getting at: that you will 
present yourself as a person who will do what you said you will do, and you don’t do what you 
say you will do. In fact maybe you will do it and maybe you won’t. That’s inauthentic.
PAUL
Well, I wouldn’t agree.
