Forum Day Four: Session One

KIPP
You understand that enthusiasm is a threat to your survival? Joy is a threat to your survival? 
Self-expression is a threat to your survival? I’m not saying any of those are good, or the way 
you should be, and the way you are isn’t the way you should be. I’m not saying that; it’s easy to 
hear that. I’m just saying that you’re locked out of most of life. One’s not better than the other. 
But right now you have no choice. 
KENNETH
It would be nice to have a choice.
KIPP
It would give you freedom to have a choice.
KENNETH
Yeah, which is what I felt for a little bit last night.
KIPP
Yeah, and rigorously speaking, it wasn’t a feeling.
KENNETH
That’s what I saw last night.
KIPP
Yeah. Your feelings are a product of your racket, or the context of whatever you give your feelings to 
occur in. So far your feelings have had the space of your racket.
KENNETH
Yes.
KIPP
Anything else?
KENNETH
Thank you.
(applause as Kenneth sat)
KIPP
Well done!
SARAH
Where do I start? Let me fi nd a place... I got my racket, and saw, last night, the terror of it.
