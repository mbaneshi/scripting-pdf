Forum Day Three: Session Four
277
(to another participant sitting next to the participant who said she does what she wants to do)
Sit on her lap, or hold her arms down, or something.
(the other participant sits on the fi rst participant’s lap)
Now: want to stand up.
(the participant cannot stand up)
So, you don’t always do what you want to do. And you don’t do what you like to do. You do what
you do. That’s all you ever do. You’ve always done what you did, and sometimes coincidentally,
from time to time it happens to be what you wanted to do.
PARTICIPANT
That’s nonsense.
ERHARD
It is nonsensical.
PARTICIPANT
Then why do The Forum?
ERHARD
That’s what I said. We’re going to stop doing The Forum as soon as I fi nd someone who did
something they didn’t do.
A participant named Kevin stood, who, during Erhard’s conversation with Jacob in the previous
session, had complained that the camera pointing at Jacob was also pointing at people in the “no-
video” section.
KEVIN
I came to The Forum very skeptical of the whole thing. My feeling was that I would probably
get something out of it. I was sure I was going to have to go through so much bullshit I wasn’t
sure I was going to last it out. As it turned out that was partially true, because I, like a bunch of
other people, I sense, I felt like we were being sold the next session at every opportunity. But at
this point in the game I’m willing to accept that too. It wasn’t as bad as I thought it was going
to be. I didn’t really start to get into this until yesterday, or maybe it was today. In searching for
my racket, I just couldn’t seem to fi nd my racket. But during the sharing, I had the feeling that
every single person who stood, everyone’s racket seemed to be my racket. I couldn’t believe it.
Today I guess I made a breakthrough.
WES
Hold on. I want to complete this stuff  about “I guess I had a breakthrough.” I don’t mean even
the “guess” part. Where are you looking to declare a breakthrough? Where does breakthrough
occur?

SPEAKING BEING
KEVIN
I felt like I discovered something I didn’t know before.
WES (pointing to his mouth)
This is where the breakthrough happens. Right here.
ERHARD (coming forward)
Wait a second, this is something we need to handle here. Kevin, did you know that you are
stingy?
KEVIN
Well, that’s kind of a surprise.
ERHARD
I want you to wake up to that. You are stingy, my friend. You think you’re precise and careful,
but you’re actually stingy. You mistake precision and care—which are laudable—for being
stingy. You’re ungenerous. Not big. It does not enroll people into your view. It alienates people.
They don’t fuck with you because you’re too careful and precise. But they don’t like you. It’s
unattractive and it disempowers you. You’ve probably got something to give, but nobody will
get it from you. People won’t “get” from stingy people. I don’t require that you discuss that with
me.
KEVIN
I don’t mind discussing it with you, I just can’t really fi nd in my mind where I’m stingy because
I don’t think that other people feel that I’m stingy. I’ve got other problems, but I’m searching to
fi nd where I’m stingy and I don’t see it.
ERHARD
And that’s what I want you to do. I want you to stay in the question tonight about being stingy.
Are you married?
KEVIN
Yes.
ERHARD
Ask your wife.
(laughter)
I don’t mean stingy with money. I mean stingy with forwarding the action, stingy with
contributing aliveness, stingy with empowerment. Ask your wife, or ask the people that work
for you. Okay, please go on. I don’t mean to cut you off  on that, I just think that it’s more useful
for you to take a look at it overnight, and if you’re wanting to discuss it further I am willing to
do that tomorrow. Is that all right with you?
