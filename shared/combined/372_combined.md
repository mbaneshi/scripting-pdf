SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
What it means is, “Then fuck it!” So you’ve got to get, not only that it’s empty and meaningless,
but also that it’s empty and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless.
SALLY
Well, I want to do something with it...
ERHARD
I understand.
SALLY
But there’s nothing to do.
ERHARD
That’s right. There’s nothing to do. Anything you do ruins it. You want to make a prescription
out of it, Sally. You want it to tell you what to do. And like I said yesterday, the truth never
gives any prescription. And if you get any prescription out of the truth, you suck the truth value
out of it. It becomes devoid of any truth value. All you can do with this is get it. It’s not worth
anything; it’s worth nothing; it’s worthless: Because you can’t use it. It doesn’t help you to win;
it doesn’t help you to avoid losing; it doesn’t help you to be right... see, if only it would tell you
what to do with your life, then you would be happy. See, you would all be happy if we put on a
presentation here, skillfully enough so that you actually believed that you knew what you were
supposed to do with your life. So listen up. If we had a real scam ... and Wes and Kipp and I are
smart enough to put one together—make a note—it’s maybe worth doing.
(laughter)
But I want you to listen. What would people say if you did The Forum and it left you knowing
clearly what you were supposed to do with your life? People would really love that, wouldn’t
they?
SALLY
It would be a lot easier to sign up.
ERHARD
Yeah, it would be a lot easier to sign up, and we could charge more.
(laughter)
I want you to see how silly you are. If The Forum... You’d really have to believe it, wouldn’t
you? Otherwise it would be bullshit. Suppose after The Forum was all over, you had no doubt—
none—it was crystal clear to you that you had found out what you were supposed to do with
your life, really supposed to do. You would be very happy. Very happy. If you knew exactly
what you were supposed to do, what you’re really supposed to do, you’d be real happy, because
you’d have the answer. Julie?
Nothing: Beyond Nihilism
In An Introduction to Metaphysics, Heidegger points out that if
the fundamental question of metaphysics were to be put simply
as “Why are there beings?” then we would be starting from an
assumption of the being’s is-ness, its givenness as a being. But,
says Heidegger, with the addition of a second clause—“Why are
there beings at all instead of nothing?”—the givenness of the
being is thrown into question, and the being itself is held out “into
the possibility of not-being,” and thus begins “to waver” (IM 31).
Until we have confronted this possibility of non-Being, and have
thus opened ourselves to the other side of Being, we have not
appropriated our true nature: “Da-sein means: being held out into
the nothing” (“WM” in BW 103).
W
The event of nihilation is an essential element of Being:
“Being nihilates—as Being” (“LH” in BW 261). However, this
W
statement should not be heard as justifying charges that
Heidegger’s thinking is nihilism:
But where is the real nihilism at work? Where
one clings to current beings and believes it is
enough to take beings, as before, just as the
beings that they are. But with this, one rejects
the question of Being and treats Being as a
nothing (nihil), which in a certain way it even
“is,” insofar as it essentially unfolds. Merely to
chase aft er beings in the midst of the oblivion
of Being—that is nihilism. . . . In contrast, to
go expressly up to the limit of Nothing in the
question about Being, and to take Nothing into
the question of Being—this is the first and only
fruitful step toward the true overcoming of
nihilism. (IM 226

Forum Day Four: Session One

JULIE
And then I would start bitching.
ERHARD
Exactly. This is a wise woman. How does she know “then I would start bitching”? Because you
always bitch. That’s like shooting fi sh in a barrel, that kind of a prediction. I told you about the
Boy Scouts. It didn’t make any diff erence: “Today we’re going on a hike”; “Today we’re going
swimming.” “Oh no!” Everything was “oh no!” So, you can’t get anything out of this. I told you
the truth. You don’t use the truth; the truth uses you.
SALLY
Where I keep... I guess where I keep getting stuck is I want to get it so that possibility opens up.
ERHARD
That’s an in-order-to. That’s called a “rice Christian”: That’s when you go to church to get rice.
Getting paid. Most of you go to church in-order-to, don’t you? Sure you do. Don’t bullshit me. I
know why you go to church. You go to church in-order-to. It’s sacrilegious.
(asking a participant to stand up; turning back to Sally)
So you’ve just got to get rid of the in-order-tos: Whether you do or not is up to you, not up to me.
SALLY
But aren’t they just going to keep coming back?
ERHARD
Sure, they’re going to keep coming back; that’s why you’ve got to be able to dwell in that it’s
empty and meaningless, and that it’s empty and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless.
Dwell in; not believe, not understand, not remember. That’s why we don’t speak in concepts in
here, because concepts are things people remember and forget. Distinctions remember you. You
don’t remember them; they remember you. You don’t use them; they use you. That’s why we’ve
got this funny language. It’s the language of distinction, not the language of conceptualization.
(to Sally)
What else?
SALLY
I’m going to sit down, because I don’t know what there is I have to do.
ERHARD
There’s nothing you have to do.
Thus nihilism consists in the avoidance of the nothing, since by
avoiding nothingness, we in fact avoid the full disclosure of Being.
Thereby, we retain an incomplete apprehension of our possibility
as beings. Nevertheless, Heidegger does not deny that the “Nothing”
speaks something fundamentally disturbing:
The nothing itself does not attract; it is
essentially repelling. But this repulsion is
itself as such a parting gesture toward beings
that are submerging as a whole. This wholly
repelling gesture toward beings that are in
retreat as a whole, which is the action of the
nothing that oppresses Dasein in anxiety, is the
essence of the nothing: nihilation. It is neither
an annihilation of beings nor does it spring
from a negation. Nihilation will not submit
to calculation in terms of annihilation and
negation. The nothing itself nihilates. (“WM” in
BW 103
W
)
“
As Being and beings move apart, as Being withdraws into its
always-potential concealment, the everyday meaning of beings is
ongoingly subject to nihilation. Revealing and concealing, Being
gives and nothing nihilates. This is the way of the world. And in
the nihilating of the nothing lies the possibility of the clearing:
In the clear night of the nothing of anxiety the
original openness of beings as such arises: that
they are beings—and not nothing.  [. . .] The
essence of the originally nihilating nothing
lies in this, that it brings Da-sein for the first
time before beings as such. Only on the ground
of the original revelation of the nothing can
human existence approach and penetrate
beings. (“WM” in BW 103
W
)

SPEAKING BEING
SALLY
So then I’m going to sit down.
ERHARD
No. You’re only going to sit down if you do. You’re not going to sit down because there’s nothing
to do; you’re going to sit down if you sit down. And if you don’t sit down, you don’t sit down.
You’re not going to sit down “because.” You’re still trying to fi nd something to save you. There’s
no life rings in here. This is the place where we take all the life rings away. There’s nothing to
stand on. I want you to stand on nothing. I want you to stand on empty and meaningless. Meet
life with no foundation, with no background, with no learning. Yeah of course you have all the
learning and all the experience, but you’re not stuck with it. You’re not stuck with what you
know; you’re not stuck with your condition; you’re not stuck with your past.
SALLY
I have a question. So, if what I’m making it mean is that it’s hopeless: Are you saying that I
don’t have to make it mean that?
ERHARD
If what you’re making it mean is that it’s hopeless, what you want to do is to see that you are
making it mean that it’s hopeless. You’re doing that. Now, by the way: It is hopeless. And the
reason it’s hopeless is because of what you have to have if you’re going to have hope. There’s
only one thing you’ve got to have. Hope cannot exist without hopelessness. And the stronger
you get your hopes up, the more down in the swamp, down at the bottom of the Valley of the
Shadow of Death, down in the swamp there, is hopelessness. So the more hope you’ve got, the
more green slimy monsters there are down in the Valley of the Shadow of Death. Hopelessness.
It lives down in the swamp at the bottom of the Valley of the Shadow of Death, with all your
hope up there at the top, except the green slimy monsters keep you from ever being satisfi ed,
from ever being full of joy. Look, you make a drama up out of being tired. You should have seen
you the fi rst night. A true drama out of being tired; you make a fucking drama out of death.
That’s right, death is so nasty because you made a drama out of it. Death is nothing but dying.
It’s not a drama. Who said death was bad? You did. Okay fi ne: Pope. One thing. People worry
about death, right? What is there to worry about? Let me explain something to you: You are
going to die. Don’t worry. You are. You are going to die. And so is everybody else. Everybody
you love and care about, they’re all going to die. Don’t worry. They will.
(a participant objects)
You’re a bit nutty about this. You get up every time I talk about dying. And you know what?
You won’t die one minute before you do. And you want to know what? You won’t live one min-
ute longer when you’re dead. You don’t have to worry about that. It’s all taken care of. You’re
not going to die before you do and you’re not going to live after you die. Now you can worry
about something else. So that business about hope and hopelessness: It’s the same conversa-
tion about liking yourself. What is this hope crap? What does that change? What does that do?
What does that make? What is the value of hope? If you hope it’s going to turn out all right, that
This is an essential element of the approach to Being which is
taken in the dialogue of The Forum. To reach Being, one must
travel by way of the nothing. To discover possibility, one must
confront the facticity, the trap, of no-possibility. Further, what
Heidegger calls “authentic Being-towards-death,” or “freedom
towards death,” may be seen as consistent with these other
views: to experience the authentic possibility of one’s life, one
must confront one’s essential nullity. Conscience calls Dasein—
fallen into the untruth of the “they” self—to “appropriate
untruth authentically” (BT 345), to bring authenticity to one’s
T
inauthenticity, to be in the trap.
It is of the utmost importance, however, to stress again
this point: to “confront” means to experience an ontological
encounter, not merely an ontical or conceptual realization. For
r
instance, the merely ontic recognition that we all die is of course
commonplace. On the other hand, the ontological experience of
the death of one’s self as identity, and the deep realization of the
possibility of one’s self as an opening, with all the ramifications
of anxiety and homelessness which that experience entails, is far
from commonplace. This is the revelation of the nothing, the call
of conscience, which Heidegger posits as the ground for authentic
existence, and this is the encounter for which the rhetorical
structure of The Forum is designed.
Authentic inquiry into Being is likely to arouse resistance,
and this resistance may be located precisely at the juncture
where Being’s other side, the Nothing, must be confronted. Here
is the true challenge of Heidegger’s thinking, which Caputo calls
“the danger of Heidegger’s path”: at this juncture “there are no
assurances,” and “in this darkness and uncertainty lies one of the
largest difficulties with Heidegger’s work” (The Mystical Element
l
in Heidegger’s Thought 245). Caputo quotes Paul Huhnerfeld,
who has compared Heidegger’s way with religious paths to
transformation, such as that of the Christian mystic Meister
Eckhart: “Meister Eckhart would never have taken the mystical
step if he had believed that he was leaping into Nothingness
instead of into the arms of God” (245).

makes it turn out all right, right? Or it’s going to turn out wrong if you hope it’s going to turn
out so you don’t dare hope. It’s voodoo. That’s nuts. That’s a guy following me with a knife with
blood dripping down from it: “Don’t look! But you can’t see him anyhow, only I can see him.”
(laughter)
Look, what are you hoping for? You’re hoping it’ll all be all right, huh?
SALLY
Yeah.
ERHARD
But it won’t be all right. It’ll be the way it is. It won’t be any diff erent from the way it is. That’s
the way it will be. It’ll be the way that it is. And all you’re doing is making a drama out of it. Is
that clear?
SALLY
Yes.
ERHARD
If you like making dramas out of it go ahead. What you do with your life is none of my busi-
ness. That’s not my business, that’s your business.
SALLY
So there’s no good or bad, there’s just the way it is.
Erhard’s manner is very relaxed and casual at this point, ranging freely in volume from loud to
intimate.
ERHARD
There is good and bad. Go out there and shoot someone; then you’ll fi nd out how bad it is.
SALLY
All right, that’s where I’m stuck then, because...
ERHARD
I know you’re stuck. I know how you were brought up.
(laughter)
Yeah, there is good and bad, but not inherently. Inherently there’s nothing. Was there goodness
in the rainstorm when the fl ood came from the rain that killed people? Don’t you see that that’s
insane? The rainstorm isn’t good or bad it’s a goddamn rainstorm. Where does good and bad
exist? In a conversation. And that conversation has a lot of force to it. You exist in a particular
culture; a particular religious culture, a particular ethnic culture, a particular national cul-
ture, a particular family culture, and that’s where good and bad arose from. It’s a phenomenon
Caputo finds in this aspect of Heidegger’s thought a “serious
difficulty”: “It does not seem to me that many of Heidegger’s
excited and enthusiastic followers, who speak like Heidegger, as
though they have experienced what Heidegger experienced, have
recognized the austerity of Heidegger’s path or acknowledged the
danger which lies along this path” (252–253). The danger of the
path, says Caputo, lies in the powerlessness of human beings who
travel it, and in their inability to find secure ground and comfort
in the mysterious realm of Being, whose apparently arbitrary
nature Heidegger has described here, explicating Fragment 52 of
Heraclitus, as “play”:
The “because” withers away in the play. The
play is without “why.” It plays since it plays.
It simply remains a play: the most elevated
and the most profound. But this “simply”
is everything, the one, the only. Nothing is
without ground/reason. Being and ground/
reason: the same. Being, as what grounds,
has no ground; as the abyss it plays the play
that, as Geschick [destiny], passes [B]eing and
k
ground/reason to us. The question remains
whether and how we, hearing the movements
of this play, play along and accommodate
ourselves to the play. (PR 113)
“
Thus, for Caputo, Heidegger’s thought moves “close to the edge of
despair. For he makes us dependent upon the outcome of a ‘game’
upon which our very essence is staked, a game in which thinking
may lend a hand but in which it has no final say” (251–252).
The diff iculty with Heidegger is not that he is
a mystic, but that he is not. His thought is so
radically worldly and secular and drained of
absolute and divine assurances that it can at
best assist in a world-play; for the kingdom is
in the hands of a child. (252)

which arises only in language. There is no good or bad outside of language. Now good and bad
is very real stuff . But it’s a phenomenon that only exists in language.
(loudly)
Listen up, goddamn it! You’ve stopped thinking again. You think you’ve got it so you don’t have
to think. The fl oor as an object exists independent of language. That clear? For whom is that
not clear? Put your hand up if that isn’t clear?
(looking around the room)
The existence of the fl oor as an object doesn’t require language. Is that clear?
(pausing)
Good. Is there any such thing as art independent of language? Where there is no language,
is there art? No, because art is a phenomenon that arises only in language. Now you assholes
think I said art’s not real and fl oors are. I didn’t say that. Art is very real. It alters the course of
history, has a profound impact on the culture, changes people’s lives, brings things into peo-
ple’s lives that would not be there were it not for art. It’s very real stuff . It’s real, and it does not
exist independent of language. Art is a phenomenon that only arises in language. Is that clear?
There’s no such thing as beauty independent of language. Beauty is a phenomenon which only
arises in language. There’s no such thing as beauty independent of language. Beauty is real,
and it does not exist independent of language. You need to start thinking and stop believing.
You believe too much. There is no such thing as art or beauty or design, no such thing as
love and happiness. None of the things that are important to you in life exist independent of
language. Birds don’t build homes. Nests are hard-wired into birds. You don’t understand that
then don’t get engaged in the conversation. That part of the conversation. Only agents with lan-
guage, only people build homes. Homes are a phenomenon that only arises, only in language.
So there’s no such thing as beauty or art. Here’s what you want to get out of this. Not beauty or
art: This is not a course on aesthetics. What you want to get out of it is that there are certain
phenomena that arise only in language. Over where your dog is, nothing is bad. You know
where bad is for your dog? Where you are. That’s where bad arises to the dog, because bad is
a phenomenon that only exists in language. Independent of language there is no bad. There is
no bad in an earthquake for the earthquake. There’s only bad for people with language...sorry:
entities with language. And that’s the same thing about good. But it’s very real stuff . It’s not
unreal. Now, language comes out of silence, which is a form of empty and meaningless. Good
and bad come out of nothing. It doesn’t come out of inherent good or bad. It’s not like you can
ignore it. It’s not like it isn’t true. It’s real stuff , and it arises only in language. You can’t report
that something is good. You can’t give a report that something is bad. Good and bad only arise
in language. You can’t talk about something being good: Now you do, don’t you? That’s because
you’re stupid. You talk about things being good and bad. You talk in ignorance that what you’re
talking about when you talk about good and bad is talking. That’s like talking about talking,
you understand? When you talk about good and bad you’re talking about talking.
(to Sally)
You were saying?
Caputo’s point is important, and is central to a consideration
of the path which Heidegger is inviting us to follow. The authors
of this book are certainly among those whom Caputo has
described as “excited and enthusiastic” about the possibilities
of Heidegger’s thinking. However, we do not claim to have
“experienced what Heidegger experienced”: we do feel an affinity
for that realm of experience about which he speaks; that affinity
is due, at least in part, to our participation in the work of Werner
Erhard. Thus, in the face of Caputo’s challenge, we must ask
ourselves whether we have truly confronted the “austerity and
danger” of Heidegger’s path.
This is a question that must be asked persistently—a
question which must be stood within, rather than answered—
since Being must be continually wrested from, and contextualized
by, non-Being. The nihilation of the nothing must be ongoing. But
the original encounter is fraught with agon, that is, with contest:
human resistance to confronting the Nothing is fundamental.
The Nothing’s enormity so violates our everyday identity that we
instinctively close ourselves to the possibility which it contains.
Heidegger states:
We are so finite that we cannot even bring
ourselves originally before the [N]othing
through our own decision and will. So
profoundly does finitude entrench itself in
existence that our most proper and deepest
limitation refuses to yield to our freedom.
(“WM” in BW 106)
W
“
Therefore, the struggle to provide an authentic confrontation with
the austerity of the Nothing, and to overcome the resistance to its
realization, is a central element of The Forum.
The important questions to be considered in comparing
Heidegger with religious models of transformation, such as
Meister Eckhart, are these: what might be the transformative
power of a leap into the truly unknown rather than into the
arms of a comforting and fatherly God? Might not the “danger”
of Heidegger’s thinking, that abysmal lack of certainty which
characterizes his leap, in fact constitute its possibility? Might not

خود به عنوان چنین حرکات فراوانی نسبت به موجودات

دفع ژست به سمت موجوداتی که در آن وجود دارد
عقب نشینی به طور کلی ، که عمل عمل است
هیچ چیز که دزین را در اضطراب ظلم کند ، این است

نفی هیچ چیز به خودی خود نیه نمی کند. ("Wm" در

همانطور که موجودات و موجودات از هم جدا می شوند.
مخفیگاه همیشه پتانسیل ، معنای روزمره موجودات است
به طور مداوم در معرض نیهلاسیون است. آشکار و پنهان شدن ، بودن
نمی دهد و هیچ چیز نیه نمی کند. این راه جهان است. و در
نیه هیچ چیز امکان پاکسازی را نهفته است:
در شب روشن هیچ چیز اضطراب
باز بودن اصلی موجودات به همین ترتیب بوجود می آید:
آنها موجود هستند - و نه هیچ چیز. [ بشر .]
جوهر در اصل نیه هیچ چیز
در این امر نهفته است ، که برای اولین بار Da-Sein را به ارمغان می آورد
زمان قبل از موجودات به این ترتیب. فقط در زمین
از مکاشفه اصلی هیچ چیز نمی تواند

سالی
بنابراین من می خواهم بنشینم. درز
نه. شما فقط می خواهید بنشینید اگر این کار را انجام دهید. شما نمی خواهید بنشینید زیرا هیچ چیز وجود ندارد
برای انجام اگر بنشینید می خواهید بنشینید. و اگر نمی نشینید ، نمی نشینید. شما نمی خواهید بنشینید "زیرا". شما هنوز هم سعی می کنید چیزی را برای نجات شما بدست آورید. وجود دارد
هیچ زندگی در اینجا وجود ندارد. این مکانی است که ما تمام حلقه های زندگی را از بین می بریم. هیچ چیز وجود ندارد
بایستید من می خواهم شما روی هیچ چیز بایستید. من می خواهم شما روی خالی و بی معنی بایستید. ملاقات
زندگی بدون پایه و اساس ، بدون پیشینه و بدون یادگیری. بله البته شما همه
یادگیری و تمام تجربه ، اما شما با آن گیر نمی کنید. شما با آنچه شما گیر نکرده اید
دانستن شما با وضعیت خود گیر نکرده اید. شما با گذشته خود گیر نکرده اید. سالی
من یک سوال دارم بنابراین ، اگر آنچه من آن را می سازم این است که ناامید است: آیا شما می گویید که من
لازم نیست این را به این معنی؟ درز
اگر آنچه را که می سازید این است که ناامید است ، کاری که می خواهید انجام دهید این است که ببینید شما هستید
ساختن آن به این معنی است که ناامید است. شما این کار را می کنید اکنون ، به هر حال: این ناامید کننده است. و
دلیل این ناامید کننده به دلیل آنچه شما باید داشته باشید اگر امیدوار باشید. وجود دارد
فقط یک چیز شما باید داشته باشید. امید بدون ناامیدی نمی تواند وجود داشته باشد. و قوی تر
شما امیدهای خود را بالا می برید ، بیشتر در باتلاق ، پایین در پایین دره
سایه مرگ ، پایین در باتلاق در آنجا ، ناامیدی است. بنابراین امیدوارم که بیشتر داشته باشید ،
هیولاهای باریک سبز بیشتر در دره سایه مرگ وجود دارد. ناامیدی در باتلاق در پایین دره سایه مرگ زندگی می کند ، با همه شما
امیدوارم که در بالا باشد ، به جز هیولاهای باریک سبز شما را از رضایت خود باز می دارد ،
از همیشه پر از شادی. ببین ، شما از خسته شدن یک درام درست می کنید. باید دیده بودی
شما اولین شب. یک درام واقعی از خسته شدن ؛ شما یک درام لعنتی از مرگ درست می کنید. درست است ، مرگ بسیار ناخوشایند است زیرا شما درام را از آن ساخته اید. مرگ چیزی نیست جز مرگ. این یک درام نیست چه کسی گفت مرگ بد است؟ تو کردی باشه FI NE: پاپ. یک چیز مردم نگران هستند
در مورد مرگ ، درست است؟ چه چیزی برای نگرانی وجود دارد؟ بگذارید چیزی را برای شما توضیح دهم: تو هستی
رفتن به مرگ نگران نباشید تو هستی شما می خواهید بمیرید. و همه افراد دیگر نیز همینطور هستند. همه
شما عاشق و مراقبت می کنید ، همه آنها می میرند. نگران نباشید آنها خواهند کرد (اشیاء شرکت کننده)
شما در این مورد کمی مغذی هستید. هر وقت در مورد مرگ صحبت می کنم بلند می شوید. و می دانید چه؟ شما یک دقیقه قبل از این کار نخواهید مرد. و شما می خواهید بدانید که چیست؟ شما یک دقیقه زندگی نمی کنید-
وقتی مرده اید طولانی تر است. لازم نیست نگران این موضوع باشید. این همه مراقبت می شود شما
قبل از انجام این کار نمی میرید و بعد از مرگ نمی خواهید زندگی کنید. حالا می توانید نگران باشید
در مورد چیز دیگری بنابراین آن تجارت در مورد امید و ناامیدی: این همان مکالمه است-
در مورد دوست داشتن خود این تله امید چیست؟ چه چیزی تغییر می کند؟ این چه کاری انجام می دهد؟ این چه چیزی را ایجاد می کند؟ ارزش امید چقدر است؟ اگر امیدوار هستید که همه چیز درست شود ، این
این یک عنصر اساسی از رویکرد به وجود است که
در گفتگوی انجمن گرفته شده است. برای رسیدن به بودن ، باید
سفر از طریق هیچ چیز. برای کشف احتمال ، باید
مقابله با واقعیت ، دام ، بدون امکان. علاوه بر این ، چه
Heidegger "معتبر بودن-دلهره" یا "آزادی" می نامد
به سمت مرگ ، "ممکن است با این موارد دیگر سازگار باشد
نمایش ها: برای تجربه احتمال معتبر زندگی شخص ، یکی
باید با باطل اساسی فرد مقابله کند. وجدان Dasein را صدا می کند -
در حقیقت "آنها" خود به "مناسب" افتادند
به طور واقعی درست نیست "(BT 345) ، برای به دست آوردن اصالت به شخص
حرف
عدم اعتماد به نفس ، در دام بودن. با این حال ، استرس دوباره از اهمیت بالایی برخوردار است
این نکته: "مقابله" به معنای تجربه یک هستی شناختی است
برخورد ، نه صرفاً یک تحقق مفهومی یا مفهومی. برای
حرف
به عنوان مثال ، شناخت صرفاً روی آن که همه ما می میریم البته است
معمول از طرف دیگر ، تجربه هستی شناختی
مرگ خود شخص به عنوان هویت ، و تحقق عمیق
امکان خود شخص به عنوان یک افتتاحیه ، با تمام پیامدها
از اضطراب و بی خانمانی که این تجربه مستلزم آن است ، بسیار دور است
از معمول این مکاشفه هیچ چیز نیست ، تماس
وجدان ، که هایدگر به عنوان زمینه ای برای معتبر مطرح می کند
وجود ، و این برخورد بلاغی است
ساختار انجمن طراحی شده است. تحقیق معتبر در مورد وجود احتمالاً مقاومت را برانگیخته است ،
و این مقاومت ممکن است دقیقاً در محل قرار داشته باشد
جایی که طرف دیگر بودن ، هیچ چیز ، باید با آن روبرو شود. در اینجا
چالش واقعی تفکر هایدگر است که کاپوتو آن را صدا می کند
"خطر مسیر هایدگر": در این مقطع "هیچ وجود ندارد
تضمین ها ، "و" در این تاریکی و عدم اطمینان یکی از موارد است
بزرگترین مشکلات مربوط به کار هایدگر "(عنصر عرفانی
سعادت
در فکر هایدگر 245). Caputo به نقل از Paul Huhnerfeld ،
چه کسی راه هایدگر را با مسیرهای مذهبی مقایسه کرده است
تحول ، مانند MEISTER مسیحی مسیحی
اکهارت: "میستر اکهارت هرگز عرفانی را نمی گرفت
قدم اگر او اعتقاد داشت که به هیچ چیز نمی پرید
به جای ورود به آغوش خدا "(245). روز چهارم: جلسه یک

درست است ، درست است؟ یا اگر امیدوار هستید که تبدیل شود اشتباه خواهد شد
بیرون ، بنابراین شما جرات امیدواری ندارید. این voodoo است این آجیل است این یک پسر با چاقو با من دنبال می شود
خون از آن فرو می رود: "نگاه نکنید! اما شما به هر حال نمی توانید او را ببینید ، فقط من می توانم او را ببینم."
(خنده)
ببین ، به چه چیزی امیدوار هستی؟ شما امیدوار هستید که همه چیز خوب باشد ، ها؟ سالی
بله درز
اما این درست نخواهد بود. این به شکلی خواهد بود. این تفاوت با روشی که هست تفاوت ندارد. یعنی
راهی که خواهد بود این راهی خواهد بود که هست. و تمام کاری که شما انجام می دهید این است که درام را از آن خارج کنید. است ،
این واضح است؟ سالی
بله درز
اگر دوست دارید درام را از آن خارج کنید ، پیش بروید. کاری که شما با زندگی خود انجام می دهید هیچ یک از مشاغل من نیست-
ness این کار من نیست ، این تجارت شماست. سالی
بنابراین هیچ چیز خوب یا بدی وجود ندارد ، فقط روشی که هست وجود دارد. شیوه Erhard در این مرحله بسیار آرام و گاه به گاه است ، و آزادانه از حجم از صدای بلند تا
صمیمی درز
خوب و بد است. به آنجا بروید و به کسی شلیک کنید. سپس می دانید که چقدر بد است. سالی
خوب ، این جایی است که من در آن زمان گیر کرده ام ، زیرا ... erhard
من می دانم که شما گیر کرده اید. من می دانم که چگونه شما بزرگ شده اید. (خنده)
بله ، خوب و بد وجود دارد ، اما ذاتاً نیست. ذاتاً هیچ چیز وجود ندارد. خوب بود
در طوفان باران هنگامی که fl ood از باران ناشی می شود که مردم را کشته است؟ نمی بینید که این است
مجنون؟ طوفان باران خوب یا بد نیست. کجا خوب و بد است
وجود دارد؟ در یک مکالمه و آن مکالمه نیروی زیادی برای آن دارد. شما در یک خاص وجود دارد
فرهنگ ؛ یک فرهنگ دینی خاص ، یک فرهنگ قومی خاص ، یک کلیت ملی
Ture ، یک فرهنگ خانوادگی خاص ، و این همان جایی است که خوب و بد از آن ناشی می شود. این یک پدیده است
کاپوتو در این جنبه از فکر هایدگر "جدی" پیدا می کند
دشواری ":" به نظر من بسیاری از هایدگر
پیروان هیجان زده و مشتاق ، که مانند هایدگر صحبت می کنند ،
اگرچه آنها آنچه را که هایدگر تجربه کرده اند تجربه کرده اند ، اما
ریاضت مسیر هایدگر را به رسمیت شناخت یا تصدیق کرد
خطری که در این مسیر نهفته است "(252-253)
Caputo می گوید ، مسیر در ناتوانی انسانها نهفته است
آن را سفر کنید ، و در ناتوانی آنها در یافتن زمین امن و راحتی
در قلمرو اسرارآمیز هستی ، که ظاهراً خودسرانه است
طبیعت هایدگر در اینجا شرح داده است ، و توضیح آن قطعه 52 از
هراکلیتوس ، به عنوان "بازی":
"زیرا" در نمایشنامه از بین می رود. در
بازی بدون "چرا" است. از آنجا که بازی می کند بازی می کند. این به سادگی یک نمایشنامه باقی می ماند: بلندترین
و عمیق ترین اما این "به سادگی"
همه چیز است ، یکی ، تنها. هیچ چیز نیست
بدون زمین/دلیل بودن و زمین بودن/
دلیل: همان. بودن ، به عنوان چه زمینه ای ،
هیچ زمینه ای ندارد به عنوان پرتگاه ، نمایشنامه را بازی می کند
که ، به عنوان Geschick [Destiny] ، [b] eing و
k
زمین/دلیل برای ما. سوال باقی مانده است
آیا و چگونه ما ، با شنیدن حرکات
از این بازی ، بازی کنید و در آن اسکان دهید
خودمان به نمایشنامه. (PR 113)
"
بنابراین ، برای کاپوتو ، فکر هایدگر "نزدیک به لبه
ناامیدی زیرا او ما را به نتیجه "بازی" وابسته می کند
که ذات ما در آن قرار دارد ، بازی ای که در آن تفکر است
ممکن است یک دست بدهد اما در آن حرف نهایی ندارد. »(251-252). تفاوت با هایدگر این نیست که او چنین نیست
یک عارف ، اما او نیست. فکر او چنین است
کاملاً دنیوی و سکولار و تخلیه شده از
تضمین های مطلق و الهی که در آن می تواند
بهترین کمک در یک بازی جهانی ؛ برای پادشاهی است
در دست کودک. (252)

وجود
که فقط در زبان بوجود می آید. در خارج از زبان خوب یا بد وجود ندارد. حالا خوب و بد
چیزهای بسیار واقعی است اما این پدیده ای است که فقط در زبان وجود دارد. (با صدای بلند)
گوش کن ، خدای آن! شما دوباره به فکر کردن متوقف شده اید. شما فکر می کنید آن را بدست آورده اید بنابراین ندارید
فکر کردن Fl Oor به عنوان یک شی مستقل از زبان است. این واضح است؟ برای چه کسی است
مشخص نیست؟ اگر مشخص نیست دست خود را بالا بگذارید؟ (نگاه کردن به اطراف اتاق)
وجود فلای به عنوان یک شیء به زبان نیازی ندارد. آیا این واضح است؟ (مکث)
خوب آیا چیزی مانند هنر مستقل از زبان وجود دارد؟ جایی که هیچ زبانی وجود ندارد ،
آیا هنر وجود دارد؟ نه ، زیرا هنر پدیده ای است که فقط در زبان بوجود می آید. اکنون شما Assholes هستید
فکر کنید من گفتم که هنر واقعی نیست و مواردی هستند. من این را نگفتم هنر بسیار واقعی است. این دوره را تغییر می دهد
تاریخ ، تأثیر عمیقی بر فرهنگ دارد ، زندگی مردم را تغییر می دهد ، چیزها
زندگی PLE که در آنجا نبود ، این برای هنر نبود. این چیزهای بسیار واقعی است واقعی است ، و اینطور نیست
مستقل از زبان وجود دارد. هنر پدیده ای است که فقط در زبان بوجود می آید. آیا این واضح است؟ هیچ چیزی به عنوان زیبایی مستقل از زبان وجود ندارد. زیبایی پدیده ای است که فقط
در زبان بوجود می آید. هیچ چیزی به عنوان زیبایی مستقل از زبان وجود ندارد. زیبایی واقعی است ،
و مستقل از زبان وجود ندارد. شما باید شروع به فکر کنید و از اعتقاد خودداری کنید. شما بیش از حد باور دارید هیچ چیزی به عنوان هنر یا زیبایی یا طراحی وجود ندارد ، هیچ چیز مانند
عشق و خوشبختی هیچ یک از مواردی که برای شما در زندگی مهم است مستقل از
زبان پرندگان خانه نمی سازند. لانه ها به پرندگان سخت می شوند. شما این را نمی فهمید
سپس درگیر مکالمه نشوید. آن بخش از مکالمه. فقط نمایندگان دارای lan-
GUAGE ، فقط مردم خانه می سازند. خانه ها پدیده ای هستند که فقط در زبان بوجود می آیند. بنابراین هیچ چیز به عنوان زیبایی یا هنر وجود ندارد. این چیزی است که شما می خواهید از این خارج شوید. زیبایی نیست یا
هنر: این دوره زیبایی شناسی نیست. آنچه می خواهید از آن خارج شوید این است که مشخص است
پدیده هایی که فقط در زبان بوجود می آیند. بیش از جایی که سگ شما است ، هیچ چیز بد نیست. شما می دانید
برای سگ شما کجاست؟ کجا هستی این جایی است که بد برای سگ بوجود می آید ، زیرا بد است
پدیده ای که فقط در زبان وجود دارد. مستقل از زبان بد نیست. وجود دارد
در زلزله برای زمین لرزه بد نیست. فقط برای افراد دارای زبان بد است ... ببخشید:
اشخاص با زبان. و این همان چیز خوب است. اما این چیزهای بسیار واقعی است این نیست
غیر واقعی اکنون ، زبان از سکوت بیرون می آید ، که نوعی خالی و بی معنی است. خوب
و بد از هیچ چیز بیرون بیاید. از خوب یا بد ذاتی بیرون نمی آید. مثل این نیست که می توانید
آن را نادیده بگیرید اینگونه نیست که درست نیست. این چیزهای واقعی است و فقط در زبان بوجود می آید. شما نمی توانید گزارش دهید
که چیزی خوب است شما نمی توانید گزارشی بدهید که چیزی بد است. خوب و بد فقط بوجود می آید
در زبان شما نمی توانید در مورد چیز خوب صحبت کنید: اکنون این کار را می کنید ، اینطور نیست؟ به این دلیل است که
شما احمق هستید شما در مورد چیزهای خوب و بد صحبت می کنید. شما با جهل صحبت می کنید که آنچه هستید
صحبت در مورد وقتی که در مورد خوب و بد صحبت می کنید صحبت می کنید. این مثل صحبت کردن در مورد صحبت کردن است ،
شما می فهمید؟ وقتی در مورد خوب و بد صحبت می کنید ، در مورد صحبت کردن صحبت می کنید. (به سالی)
می گفتی؟ نکته کاپوتو مهم است ، و در نظر گرفته شده است
از مسیری که هایدگر ما را دعوت می کند تا از آن پیروی کنیم. نویسندگان
از این کتاب مطمئناً در بین کسانی است که کاپوتو دارد
در مورد امکانات به عنوان "هیجان زده و مشتاق" توصیف شده است
از تفکر هایدگر با این حال ، ما ادعا نمی کنیم
"آنچه هایدگر را تجربه کرده است را تجربه کرده است: ما احساس وابستگی می کنیم
برای آن قلمرو تجربه ای که در مورد آن صحبت می کند ؛ آن وابستگی
حداقل تا حدودی به دلیل مشارکت ما در کار ورنر است
erhard بنابراین ، در مقابل چالش کاپوتو ، باید بپرسیم
خودمان آیا ما واقعاً با "ریاضت اقتصادی" روبرو شده ایم و
خطر "مسیر هایدگر. این سوالی است که باید با پشتکار پرسیده شود -
سؤالی که باید در درون آن بایستد ، نه اینکه پاسخ داده شود -
از آنجا
توسط ، غیر. نیشلینگ هیچ چیز نباید ادامه یابد. اما
برخورد اصلی مملو از آگون است ، یعنی با مسابقه:
مقاومت انسان در برابر مقابله با هیچ چیز اساسی است. هیچ چیز عظیمی نیست ، بنابراین هویت روزمره ما را که ما هستیم نقض می کند
به طور غریزی خود را به امکان موجود در آن نزدیک می کنیم. هایدگر اظهار داشت:
ما آنقدر محدود هستیم که حتی نمی توانیم آن را بیاوریم
خودمان در اصل قبل از [n]
از طریق تصمیم و اراده خودمان. اینقدر
عمیقاً خود را در آن قرار می دهد
وجود که مناسب ترین و عمیق ترین ما است
محدودیت از تسلیم آزادی ما امتناع می ورزد. ("Wm" در BW 106)
حرف
"
بنابراین ، تلاش برای ارائه یک رویارویی معتبر با
ریاضت هیچ چیز ، و غلبه بر مقاومت در برابر آن
تحقق ، یک عنصر اصلی انجمن است. سؤالات مهمی که در مقایسه در نظر گرفته می شود
هایدگر با مدلهای مذهبی تحول ، مانند
Meister Eckhart ، اینها هستند: چه چیزی ممکن است تحول باشد
قدرت یک جهش در واقع ناشناخته و نه به
آغوش خدای آسایش و پدرانه؟ ممکن است "خطر" نباشد
از تفکر هایدگر ، این عدم اطمینان از اطمینان است که
جهش او را توصیف می کند ، در واقع احتمال آن را تشکیل می دهد؟ ممکن است
erhard (ادامه)
