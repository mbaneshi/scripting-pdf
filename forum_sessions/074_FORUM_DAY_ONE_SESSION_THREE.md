FORUM DAY ONE: SESSION THREE
KIPP
Are there any questions regarding the ground rules?
PARTICIPANT
What are the reasons for the rules?
KIPP
Everything that we design is not meant to suppress you. Itâ€™s meant to provide
maximum possible benefit for you from The Forum.
PARTICIPANT
Iâ€™d like to know why weâ€™re spending so much time on logistics. Iâ€™m angry.
(applause from some of the group)
KIPP
So you have no question? Thanks.
Following the required rules, an opportunity to leave was announced. No one did.
KIPP
Your sitting in your chair is a promise, and we will relate to you on the basis
that you have given your word.
JULIE  (continuing to read the recommended promises)
(1) Be present for all sessions. We recommend that you be on time in the
morning and back from breaks. If you miss any part of any Forum session, you
forfeit the right to expect the results of The Forum.
(2) Do not consume drugs and medicationsâ€”including alcohol, aspirin, mar-
ijuana, but not including those prescribed by your doctorâ€”before the end of
the fourth day of The Forum.
(3) Stay awake during The Forum. Staying awake is easier if you donâ€™t slouch
or slump in your chair. If you get sleepy, we recommend that you sit straight
in the chair with your eyes open.
KIPP
A distinction has started to open up in the room: Iâ€™ll try vs. Iâ€™ll keep my promis-
es. This distinction was not merely about words. Weâ€™re not asking you to speak
a certain way. Weâ€™re showing you a distinction of an empowering way to be
with promises.
