hurt.” This last statement came from a participant who had lived in bed for eight years with back
pain.
WES
What’s here in The Forum now is a safe place to communicate what’s really so for you in your
life. We’ve designed a space in here where you can confront your own fear of being alive, your
own fear of other people and of living. I invite you to experience it, not to avoid it; not to sleep
through it. Wake up! I don’t know who you got out there that you lie to, but the ultimate jerk
is someone who lies to themselves. You may have people conned, but the one person you don’t
want to con is yourself. It turns you into the ultimate jerk. This is a chance to get straight with
yourself, to fi nd out what is running your life.
PARTICIPANT
I’m powerfully addicted to approval. If I don’t get it I leave.
WES
And what’s underneath that is fear.
(to the group)
Let it up in your body. At fi rst you’ll have to reach for it. You’re so dead to it you have to reach
for it. The fear is so frightening that you’ll fi nd an unwillingness to fully get present for it. Let it
up for yourself.
BETHANY
My knees are shaking.
WES
Allow it to be.
BETHANY
I can’t let my sons love me. I ask: “what would happen if I let them love me?”
WES
Here’s what it’s all about. You need to experience your deep and profound fear of being loved by
them. What would happen if you let that in, and then left, or they died?
BETHANY
I don’t know what I would do, or what it would feel like.
WES
Just let yourself experience what stops you from letting them love you. Very simple. Don’t make
any decisions. Just acknowledge and experience the fear. We’re in a group of exercises. That’s
what there is to do in this exercise. Just experience that.
From Fearful to Fearsome
In addition to boredom, two other human moods are presented
by Heidegger as having special potential for making possible an
authentic disclosure of our thrownness.
The first is fear. The evocation of the underlying source of fear
has been a significant element of Erhard’s work since its inception,
in both the est Training and The Forum.
The second is anxiety. Heidegger draws a fundamental
distinction between these two states-of-mind. Fear may of course
take various forms, such as alarm, terror, or dread. But in every
case the source of the fear remains the same: “All modifications
of fear, as possibilities of having a state-of-mind, point to the fact
that Dasein as Being-in-the-world is ‘fearful’” (BT 182, emphasis
added). This is the element of the human condition that is being
distinguished at this point in The Forum. In fear, “that in the face
of which we fear is a detrimental entity within-the-world” (BT
230). That is, we are always afraid of something; something has a
significance, and that significance arouses our fear. But fear is not
generated by the something.
The exercise being initiated by the Forum leader here—
referred to as the Danger Process—is designed to distinguish the
nature and source of the participants’ fear, and to transform their
relationship to life from “life is dangerous” (I am at the eff ect of
life) to “I am dangerous” (I am powerful in life).
Erhard has told the participants that The Forum is designed to
“take them down one step at a time,” and the evocation of fear at
this point is an important step. The structure of the Danger Process
first evokes the fearful mood, so that, in Heidegger’s words,
“fear can then look at the fearsome explicitly, and ‘make it clear’
to itself” (BT 180). But then, in a dramatic example of reflexive
rhetoric, the fearsome is flipped. The fearful become the fearsome.
In this way, participants take an important hurdle, a stretch toward
the ultimate leap of their transformation.
Anxiety
What is concealed in the mood of fear is anxiety. Anxiety, says
Heidegger, is “what first makes fear possible” (BT 230). Fear is, as it
were, anxiety with a false cause. Fear arises when Dasein flees the

SPEAKING BEING
Wes continued taking shares about fear, and unconcealing the fear underneath participants’
fundamental points of view.
WES
Human beings put “bad” around fear. You can’t experience what we called “bad.” But it’s always
there. You’re born into fear. If you don’t believe me, read the newspapers. Newspapers trade on
fear.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 6)
I’ve never been present to as much fear as I’m present to right now. I’m afraid if I share myself
you’ll fi nd out how bankrupt I am, that I’m stupid, uncreative, inadequate, ineff ectual, nasty,
uncaring, and you’ll throw me out of the game. I hate to say this because it’s one of my rackets
to handle this—to be humorous—I’m too short. I can see where my whole life is generated out
of this. I am just terrifi ed. I’ve done everything to prove that I’m intelligent, creative, eff ective,
productive. I lead The Forum which is a perfect way to avoid being present to the terror, when
you’re up there with a microphone and drinking out of a cup, it’s very insulating. I’m terrifi ed of
discovering how worthless I am. I went to an Ivy League university, graduated top of my class, a
successful veterinarian, an eff ective Forum leader, all in an attempt to stop you from seeing that
I’m none of the things I’m supposed to be.
WES
Thanks.
PARTICIPANT
I’m terrifi ed all the time. Scared to death of horror movies.
WES
The fear is always already there. Horror movies just bring it up. Those of you who can’t be
present to the fear raise your hands.
PARTICIPANT
I’m afraid of being alive.
WES
All it takes is being able to acknowledge it. Try on the possibility that you actually are scared
to death, and don’t know it, and don’t know that you don’t know it; that your whole life is a
strategy for avoiding the domination of life. You’re scared of living. It’s too confronting. It’s
all too dangerous. And your whole crummy act is put together as a strategy for making it in a
world of danger. Try it on. Don’t reject it. Just acknowledge it for yourself.
Here Wes called for paired sharing, where participants sitting next to each other replicated for
themselves what others have said before the entire group. Following this, Wes announced an eyes-
closed exercise.
disclosure of its thrownness, and turns in its flight toward entities
in the world, which it then identifies as the source of the fear.
In anxiety, however, the entities in their significance disappear,
and the background to all fears is revealed:
What is the diff erence phenomenally between
that in the face of which anxiety is anxious and
that in the face of which fear is afraid? That in
the face of which one has anxiety is not an entity
within-the-world. . . . That in the face of which
one is anxious is completely indefinite. . . .
[In anxiety], the world has the character of
completely lacking significance. (BT 230–231,
emphasis added)
“
In moments of anxiety, the meanings with which we customarily
comfort ourselves, even the meanings that make us fearful,
lose their certainty, so that what is disclosed is the context of
meaninglessness from which all of the meanings have been
distinguished.
That in the face of which one has anxiety is
characterized by the fact that what threatens is
nowhere. Anxiety ‘does not know’ what that in
the face of which it is anxious is. . . . it is so close
that it is oppressive and stifles one’s breath,
and yet it is nowhere. . . . [In anxiety] entities
within-the-world are of so little importance in
themselves that on the basis of this insignifi-
cance of what is within-the-world, the world
in its worldhood is all that still obtrudes itself.
What oppresses us is not this or that, nor is it the
summation of everything present-at-hand. . . .
Being-in-the-world itself is that in the face of
which anxiety is anxious. (BT 231–232)
