Forum Day One: Session One
19
ERHARD
What we were discussing is this in-order-to. I say the rain has no intention to do anything.
There’s nothing there that could intend. It just rains when it rains. There’s no intention in the
rain. Look, Charles, I’m doing something in the conversation which is designed to allow you to
take a look at your own beliefs. I’m asking questions which reduce your thesis to an absurdity.
If I ask if it rains in order to destroy life, you have to say yes if you believe that it rains in order
to sustain life, and so it makes you reexamine your theory. If you can consider the possibility
that there is no intention in the rainstorm, then you are no longer stuck with what you used to
believe.
CHARLES
I’ll keep looking at it.
ERHARD
We have to go quickly now or there won’t be any fi fth night. There’ll be a twelfth night.
Someone raised a question about why participants were not allowed to take notes in The Forum, a policy
that had been communicated when they registered for the course.
ERHARD
Because we don’t want you to retain information. So you don’t get stuck trying to remember
something. You think Bjorn Borg remembers how to hold the tennis racket? This is no diff erent
than the conversation about the rainstorm.
(loudly)
You have this superstition that you do things because you remember how to do them! You don’t
drive your car, play tennis, or live life powerfully and eff ectively out of anything you remember.
If Joe Montana had to remember how to throw the football when he’s back in the pocket, he’d
get killed every Sunday.
A woman named Doris rose with a question about the rainstorm:
DORIS
What about the role of ultimate being in natural events?
ERHARD
I don’t like to discuss ultimate being with people who don’t know their ass from a hole in the
ground.
DORIS
I fi nd that response pretty off ensive.

SPEAKING BEING
DORIS (stammering slightly)
Are you inferring that I don’t . . .?
ERHARD
No.
(pausing)
We don’t know yet.
DORIS
I assure you I do.
ERHARD
Really? We’ll see. You either do or you don’t, so there’s nothing to be nervous about. Then we
could discuss ultimate being.
(pausing)
I want you to get that I am not a guy in a diner.
He moved toward the back row where Doris was standing:
ERHARD (continuing)
When I was growing up on the east coast, my family took trips to visit people. And we would
drive home, oftentimes very late at night, oftentimes when it was raining or snowing or nasty.
And diners, as far as I knew, were places where you stopped to get a cup of coff ee so you could
stay awake while you were driving. And at my age I couldn’t let anybody do anything without
my being there, so I always had to go in with them. And I learned about guys in diners. Guys in
diners, late at night like I’m describing to you, are usually fairly lonely, because they don’t have
anybody to talk to. And they just love for somebody to stop in because then they’ve got some-
body to talk to. And you know, you go in, and you’re the only person there, and you sit up at the
counter, and you have your cup of coff ee and whatever else. And you fi nd out that this guy in
the  diner—the guy behind the counter—knows everything about everything. There is nothing
about which he does not know. He knows what the president ought to do about the defi cit, he
knows what the country ought to do about international relationships, he knows what you
ought to do about your marriage, he knows what kind of work you ought to do and how what-
ever kind of work you are doing how you could do it better, he knows something about every-
thing. Most people are like a guy in a diner. Goddamned near everybody knows everything
about everything. So in here—at least in The Forum—I question everything. Everything—in-
cluding whether or not you know your ass from a hole in the ground. And whether anyone is
qualifi ed to discuss ultimate being. I didn’t say you weren’t. That’s the way I do The Forum.
(to Doris)
Okay?
Being-in-the-world: Being-in
An important term that Werner Erhard often employs in his work,
and one which is central in the thinking of Martin Heidegger is
Being-in-the-world. To indicate clearly that a human being in his
model of things is not a self-contained Cartesian subject, separate
from an objective world “out there,” Heidegger never presents
Dasein’s Being as disconnected, either from others or from the
world. Dasein’s Being is Being-in-the-world. This indicates “a
unitary phenomenon” which “must be seen as a whole” (
y
BT 78).

However, while “Being-in-the-world cannot be broken up into
