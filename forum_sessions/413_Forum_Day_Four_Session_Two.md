Forum Day Four: Session Two

(applause)
“Shouldn’t be” is the box that problems come in for human beings. The already always existing
box you’re given when you’re born—you’re born and they slap you on the ass and they hand you
a box “this shouldn’t be.” Yeah, that’s the party. Someone’s good idea. I don’t know. And now
you’ve got this box and you put some of your junk in it, and the question is, “how come you love
that box?” Yeah, you were given the box, but you really love it. Like you have some fascination
and addiction to “shouldn’t be.” Do you have any sense that it may relate to your racket?
(laughter)r
Think about it. Rackets love problems and problems love rackets. They’re natural. They’re a fi t.
They’re a couple. Rackets and problems fi t together: a marriage made in heaven. Do you think
a racket would be any good without some juicy problems in which to make somebody wrong?
You think a racket would stay around without any problems? She has a racket with her thesis.
Her racket loves the thesis. You’re fat and you want to lose weight and you don’t have a racket
about it, you lose weight. Or you say “the hell with it” and just accept being overweight. There’s
no problem having no money, unless it “shouldn’t be.” Some people give away all their money
so that they can be free. They make money “shouldn’t be.” Your problems are a function of
“shouldn’t be,” and you get to say what “shouldn’t be.” The availability “shouldn’t be” comes
with languaging, but the specifi c use of it: That’s you. It nails your foot to the fl oor, and then
you don’t have to be responsible for going anywhere, so that’s kind of good.

“Oh God! My car won’t start. I can’t get to work. I’ll never get promoted. I’m a failure. My moth-
er was right. She’s always right, the bitch. I was right to make her wrong. She didn’t lend me
the money for the car I really need. Don’t you understand?” People love their problems. When
people get attached to their problems they carry them around forever, like this:
(Wes holds onto one of the director’s chairs and drags it as he walks slowly across the stage)
They bring them to parties. “How’s it going?”
(laughter)r
People never know what to talk about when they’re confronted by being, so they talk about
their problems. “Hey, did I tell you about my problem?”
(laughter)r
Some people become PhDs in their problem. “Oh, I’ve fi nally understood it.” Some people fi nd a
therapist they pay to listen. Therapists love people who love their problems. Then they analyze it.
(examining an imaginary object)
“Well, this particular one I’ve got is gray.”
for human being, a constitutive designation for the Being-in-the-world
of Dasein. Such metaphors, introduced into a tradition, shape the way
we understand ourselves and our world. In the Cartesian model that
has dominated our Western tradition for several centuries, Dasein is
the self-certain thinking subject—the cogito of “Cogito, ergo sum”—and
the opening for the world (and for Being) is as an “object,” or cogi-
tatum. If Dasein is that specific development of subjective self-con-
sciousness referred to as an identity, the opening for Being is whatever
y
is allowed by that particular identity’s value and truth structure.
In these perspectives, what is determinative is that Dasein
itself—as cogito, or subject, or identity—“‘gets into the picture’ in
precedence over whatever is.” Whatever is, is forced “back into
this relationship to oneself as the normative realm” (“AWP” in QCT
129). The world becomes my “picture” of it, and Being is cut to fit
that picture. The world, in other words, is all about me.
In contrast to these perspectives, Heidegger proposes the
metaphor clearing, a metaphor which, as Michael E. Zimmerman
points out, has been implicit in the Cartesian model all along:
“Modern philosophy posits a gap between subject and object
because it has failed to notice that a temporal clearing (transcen-
dence) is needed for subject and object to present themselves in
the first place” (Eclipse of the Self 25, emphasis added). In Heide-
gger’s model, absent the normative self-referring subject, there is
simply the clearing itself, and the lighting of whatever is:
In the midst of beings as a whole an open
place occurs. There is a clearing, a lighting.
Thought of in reference to what is, to beings,
this clearing is in a greater degree than are
beings. This open center is therefore not
surrounded by what is; rather, the lighting
center itself encircles all that is, like the
Nothing which we scarcely know. That which
is can only be, as a being, if it stands within
and stands out within what is lighted in this
clearing. [. . .] The nature of truth is, in itself,
the primal conflict in which that open center is
won. . . . (“OWA” in PLT 53, 55)

SPEAKING BEING
And they never get that this “understanding it,” and “analyzing it,” and this “studying it,” has only
one problem to it: They’ve still got “it.” So, how to let the problem go? Have it disappear? How to
let the problem disappear? That’s where the discussion is headed. Wake up! We’re coming to a good
part. I promise. Well, if problems occur in languaging, and the specifi c languaging that problems
occur in is “shouldn’t be,” how about trying out a new languaging? How about creating? You know
this is already given, so you’ll have to confront it ongoingly. Your racket will continue on after The
Forum, I promise. And its love for problems will continue on after The Forum, I promise. And your
fascination with problems stuck to your racket will continue on after The Forum, I promise. But
here’s the possibility in what I am saying. You can confront it: In the presence of it, you can take
your problem, and transform it by confronting the box it already comes in, and allowing a new
box—putting it into a new box—intentionally putting it into a new box. So I’m going to give you a
name of a new box you could put your problem in. This is not the truth. Problems “shouldn’t be”?
Here’s the question you have to confront: Who made you the judge? God’s happy, what’s your prob-
lem? Who made you the judge, the ultimate decider of what shouldn’t be in life? Not a lot of power
in that. So try this one on. Put a new conversation around the actual problems that you’ve got, like a
possibility. And the conversation I’m inviting you to put around them is: In life there are problems.
Wes erased “shouldn’t be” and wrote “in life there are problems” over the top of the box with the word
“problems” inside it.
WES (continuing)
Simple enough. In life there are problems. Not: Life’s about no problems. When problems
shouldn’t be, the conclusion is that a great life is a life without problems. That’s nonsense! A life
without problems is a lousy life. It’s a stinky life. You want a life without problems? We have a
little operation we can perform on you; you would have to do it in Mexico, though. We’ll remove
all your internal organs and suspend you in tepid water. That’s a life without problems. Power-
ful people are judged by their problems. The problem with you is, your problems are small and
crappy—and the same ones over and over. You’re boring. She’s been dealing with this crummy
thesis for nine years. Imagine listening to her for nine years about it?
(laughter)r
She should get some big problems and she’ll fi nish the darn thing. And then take on a job that’s
a real problem for her, and do great with that until she takes on more responsibility, runs a uni-
versity and has a lot of problems. Then you’d be interesting to talk to. That’s the problem. You’re
resisting the very thing that gives life its whole excitement—problems—because they “shouldn’t
be.” So the way to transform that is to confront each of your problems and the whole distinction
“problem” and put them in a box called “in life there are problems.” Okay. Any questions? Any
“yeah but”s and “how about”s?

So I take a problem, in my case, say, my weight. And in life there are problems. I’ve got a prob-
lem that I’m sixty pounds more than I want to be, or sixty pounds more than healthy.
As we have shown elsewhere, this is the clearing that Heidegger
saw manifested in the thinking of the pre-Socratics, the site of the
primal struggle by which they brought Being to stand, thereby
brought forth the world, and won the clearing for the emergence
of truth. A human being is a clearing in the world for things to be
the things they are.
For both Heidegger and Erhard, this is a central point: gener-
ative thinking, thinking that wants to unconceal the truth of Being
and thereby light beings, can do so only if there is first created a
clearing for the lighting: “Light can stream into the clearing,” says
Heidegger; but light itself never creates the clearing. “Rather, light
presupposes it” (“EP&TT” in BW 442). According to the scholar
W
William Lovitt, Heidegger has expressed a preference that the da
in Da-sein, be translated as openness, rather than the traditional
there (Intro to QCT, xxxv). A human being is fundamentally
T
Being-openness.
“The lumen naturale,” says Heidegger, “the light of reason,
throws light only on the open” (“EP&TT” in BW 443). But it is im-
W
portant to note that while Dasein is the clearing for the light, Dasein
is the light, as well. In Being and Time, Heidegger pointed out that
the figurative expression, lumen naturale, denotes the existen-
tial-ontological structure of Dasein itself. The light is a constituent
of Dasein, and begins to shine when Dasein “is in such a way as to
be its ‘there’” (BT 171). In becoming the opening of the clearing, we
T
become simultaneously the light which illuminates the clearing.
The dialogue of The Forum may be seen as a process for clear-
ing the opening that The Forum participants are, thereby enabling
them to know themselves as a “there” for the lighting of Being.
The first step in the process is the deconstruction of participants’
normative subjectivities, the primal struggle that responds to the
first question of The Forum: What is the Being of human beings?
This clears the opening for the second question: What is the possi-
bility of Being for human beings? It is through this second question
that the clearing is lighted. ■
