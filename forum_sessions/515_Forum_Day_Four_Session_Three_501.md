Forum Day Four: Session Three 501
Erhard called on Jane, the young woman with whom he had interacted with on Days Two and Three
about her being “worthless” after having no one she invited come to her birthday party.
ERHARD
Jane and I were having a discussion when she was standing over there. And I said: “are you
going to act out of being worthless and ugly?” And she said “not as much but probably some.”
Right? Something close to that?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Is that true or false? It’s neither. The question is garbage. She has shaped the possibility for her
future actions because she shaped the world as an occurring, by speaking a possibility. She said
“my possibility is limited to this.”
(holding up both hands to eye level)
This is how big the possibility is. It’s that big because she said so. It’s not that big because she
believes it’s that big, and not because it is that big, not because it’s her opinion that it’s that big.
It’s that big because she said so. Remember, languaging is not just what’s coming out of your
mouth. I don’t say “in a glass,” and yet it’s there in languaging. I want to make sure nobody
confuses what we are saying with “positive thinking.” See, I’m not asking her to think positively.
I don’t like positive thinking. I’m an anti-positive thinker. I like honest thinking, not positive
thinking. I like straight thinking, not positive thinking. I know that possibility is a product of
languaging, but I don’t like the word product: possibility arises in language... and that Jane
can be a conversation for the possibility of anything she wants to be. See, where am I going to
fi nd “ugly”? Can I fi nd anything ugly in somebody’s face? This is not some nice platitudinal
horseshit. Things are ugly, but they’re ugly in people’s mouths, not on people’s faces. Ugly is not
a phenomenon that arises independent of language. My dog looks at me and sees neither ugly,
nor anything else about me, because ugly is a phenomenon that only arises in language. There’s
no ugly in anybody’s face or body. Faces and bodies are just like they are. Ugly is a phenomenon
that only arises in language. This doesn’t sound very useful, does it? It sounds what you call
abstract or conceptual. See, there’s a diff erence between is ugly and occurs as ugly. What’s
the diff erence between is ugly and occurs as ugly? Something called plasticity, malleability, or
something more aptly called possibility. If something is ugly you’ve got to adjust to it, don’t you?
(forcefully)
It is ugly so you have to adjust to it. If it occurs as ugly there’s the possibility of some
malleability, some plasticity, you might be able to shape it in a new way if it occurs as ugly. I
want you to begin to see that there’s a lot of what you deal with that only arises in language.
And because it only arises in language, you’ve got something to say about it. You’ve got
something to say about being ugly—no shit—because ugly only arises in language. I’ve seen
a lot of women whose features don’t measure the perfect standard who are extraordinarily
beautiful and so has every other man in this room. Beauty is not a matter of standard features.
flexible, longer lasting, etc.” Tabachnick continues, explaining that,
for example,
A doctor may “bring forth” the already avail-
able health of an individual through medicine,
whereas cloning or genetic engineering “chal-
lenge” the natural bounds of the body, creating
a wholly new “artifact” with diff erent charac-
teristics. As Heidegger details, earlier human
inventions did not permanently impose a new
form onto nature. Under normal conditions, be-
cause the material of an artifact was still bound
by natural characteristics, nature would always
“shine through” the imposition of the artist,
craft sman or technician. A carpenter imposes
the form of a chair onto wood, but once the
chair is finished that wood still maintains its
natural characteristics to rot and decompose
in the same way a fallen tree rots and decom-
poses on the forest floor. In other words, the
craft sman’s chair is a site of openness for the
revealing of nature. (Tabachnick 2004)
“
Tabachnick compares these earlier technologies with some that
are representative of more recent developments, “technologies
that do not co-operate with nature but attempt to replace it”:
A nuclear engineer can manipulate the struc-
ture of natural elements to produce artificial
elements. Plutonium, for example, is designed to
never abide by or return to the characteristics of
the uranium from which it was derived. The char-
acter of plutonium (i.e., its level of radioactivity)
is always artificial. Likewise, the genetically
altered human is designed to never return to the
natural characteristics of the material from which
it was derived (e.g., a sick or weak body) and
thus is always artificial. In turn, contemporary

SPEAKING BEING
It’s a way of being, not features. You know, it’s nice to have good equipment, but too fucking
bad, you’ve got the equipment you’ve got. Ugly is a conversation. That’s all it is. You can’t fi nd
ugly anyplace in the universe except in people’s mouths. That’s a metaphor. Now I’ll say it
rigorously. You can’t fi nd ugly anyplace but in languaging. And if you’re listening to this like
some platitude, then you are truly an asshole. This is hard stuff  I’m taking about. Not “nice
nice.” And “worthless.” Where am I going to fi nd “worthless”?
JANE
In the conversation “worthless.”
ERHARD
Yeah. Beautiful. See, you’ve got something to say about “worthless.” You’ve got nothing to
say about your feelings. You can’t feel anything but what you’re feeling. You’ve got nothing to
say about how you feel. But you’ve got something to say about worthless and ugly. Because
worthless and ugly are a conversation, that’s all. One is a conversation for being worthless, or
one is a conversation for being ugly. And that becomes the possibility in which life and the
world and your own image occurs for you. You don’t see yourself when you look in the mirror.
You don’t see yourself like an is, you see yourself like an occur; you see yourself as an occurring
self, not an is self. And what occurs in the mirror is not in the mirror. It’s in languaging,
therefore, you have access to what occurs in the mirror: Like a conversation for the possibility
of being beautiful. It’s idiotic to walk around saying “I’m beautiful,” especially if you look
like me. You look like her, maybe, because there’s some agreement for that. I didn’t say I walk
around speaking positively. I said it’s possible for me to be engaged in the conversation for the
possibility of being beautiful. I and you and the world will occur in the space, the clearing given
by that conversation for possibility. And my actions, and my feelings, and my thoughts, will be a
correlate of that occurring. And my actions, and my feelings, and my thoughts will work on the
world. You getting this?
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
And so you have something to say about this. What you say about it is none of my business.
That’s your business. We know why you said you were ugly and worthless, because you got
something out of that, right? For the payoff . Remember the payoff  conversation?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
And so ugly and worthless was a racket for a payoff . But there’s no payoff  for the possibility of
beauty. Beauty as an assertion, “I am beautiful,” like describing yourself, like you are an object,
there’s a payoff  in that. But there’s no payoff  in the possibility of beauty. As a matter of fact it
puts you further at risk, because now you’re at risk for being beautiful. When you’re ugly you
technological artifacts do not disclose nature.
And, because in a technological society so much
of our world is filled with these “undisclosing
artifacts,” we are cut off  from, become unaware
of, or forget the essential movedness or tran-
sience of existence. (Ibid.)
We remind the reader that we are not advocating a universal
return to wooden furniture; we do not regret advances in medical
science that employ new materials. To do so would be tantamount
to the demonstration Wes carried out during The Forum, earlier
in Day Four, of arguing with the floor. At the same time we are not
making an ethical statement concerning what the technological
understanding of Being has done to human beings such that
we might, as a matter of course, accept without question even
radically dangerous technological advances. Here we are simply
focusing on the view that we are already in a technological way
of Being-in-the-world, and therefore, what is at issue is the way of
being human that has emerged with these developments.
One principle way of being human that has emerged is one that
Erhard himself has exemplified in his development of his technology
of transformation: entrepreneurship. The term “entrepreneur”
stems from the French term entreprendre, to undertake. An
entrepreneur is an enterpriser. Far from accepting or even tolerating
the way things already are, the entrepreneur envisions and reveals,
through originary naming, new possibilities which alter the way
the world occurs. With language we impact the occurring world
and consequently, our Being, for our Being is always and already in
a dance with the occurring world. We bring into Being what could
never be without being said into Being: we speak Being.
The relationship to modern technology at work in Erhard’s
technology of transformation does not immediately square with
Heidegger’s persistent complaint that holds our technological way
of being as presenting us with profound danger. The diff erence is
subtle, and will require us to walk a thin line as both thinkers are
nevertheless treading the same waters.
For instance, if we envision Heidegger’s understanding of
our technological way of being as harmonic with the in-order-to
