Forum Day Two: Session One Interval 117
of its own accord whether, as the entity which it is, it has that state of Being which
is disclosed in this interpretation” (BT 362). But really, isn’t it more accurate to say
T
that the words into which Dasein is being put are Heidegger’s words (and likewise,
Erhard’s words)? Heidegger is creating his own hermeneutical vocabulary here. Why
should we accept these terms as valid?
Heidegger is not arguing that we should. He is not proposing a final truth, but
a step on the way, and he asks that we—as ourselves Dasein—decide “of our own
accord” whether we find value in his interpretation. This is always the way that
thinking advances—through the development and testing of new vocabularies. In
the field of psychology, Freud invented a vocabulary to describe the behaviors he
observed in his work. He did not “discover” the ego and the id, but invented them,
and for decades they demonstrated their validity through their use by generations of
psychotherapists. More recently, they have been largely supplanted by other vocab-
ularies, or by psychotropic drugs; and many of Freud’s terms have taken their place
in our everyday usage, where excessive neatness is routinely characterized as “anal”
behavior, and an inflated ego is considered as natural as a sore elbow.
Werner Erhard regularly frames his work as a new vocabulary to be consid-
ered. “We ask you not to believe anything that’s said in here,” he tells The Forum
participants at the outset of the four days. Instead, he says on numerous occasions,
“consider the possibility,” or “stand in that theory and look at life,” or “try it on.”
¥
In the passage below, taken from an audiotaped 1986 seminar, we present an
example of Erhard’s phenomenological approach that is quite diff erent from that
demonstrated in The Forum. This seminar is a working session, in which he is inter-
acting with Forum graduates to develop distinctions on the subject of leadership, a
subject that Erhard has continued to develop in subsequent years into what is now
called the Being a Leader and Exercising Leadership Eff ectively Course: An Onto-
logical/Phenomenological Approach. His method here is oft en framed in a sports
metaphor, in which the ideas to be “bracketed” are characterized as the comments
of observers (“up in the stands”), while “the things themselves” are the events as
they are experienced by those engaged in the game (“down on the court”).
ERHARD
What’s on the court when you’re on the court, rather than what’s on the court
when you’re up in the stands? What’s actually there like a presence? Peter?
PETER
Me watching somebody else.
ERHARD
Okay, very good. So if we stand back from the whole thing, there was you in
the stands watching somebody else. Now, you notice something down with
the people you were watching, which is the comment of an observer giving an
account. When you were giving that account, what was the guy and the gal on
the court . . . what was present?
PETER
(Silence)
ERHARD
Now let me give you a little clue about how to do this. One of the things that I
imagine was present was somebody. Is that true? There was actually somebody
there. . . . You don’t get leadership on an empty court. . . .  So this is kind of
obvious, but at least it’s a place to start: that leadership as a presence is people.
Okay. So what else is there, like a presence? People, we got that much. What
else, like a presence, is present?
PETER
There’s action.
ERHARD
Okay, but what action? Okay, let’s just stay with that. There’s action. So leader-
ship as a presence presences itself as action. People in action. . . .
PETER
So all I have is a description of it, an observation.
ERHARD
Good. Now I want you to get down there on the court and tell me what’s there.
So far what you’ve got down there is people in action.
PETER
So there’s . . . commitment.

SPEAKING BEING
PETER
Anything I can think of is a description.
ERHARD
Yeah, it’s okay. That’s right. And every time you say it, I’m going to say that’s a
description, and what’s underneath that? Why? Because—you know, I’m going
to say this a thousand times today, I can feel it coming—because it’s the inquiry
where the power is, not the information you derive from the inquiry. Look,
we’ve invented a new technology. We’ve invented a technology called ontologi-
cal inquiry. Really, that’s wrong. We’ve invented a technology called ontological
design. The way you do ontological design is like Peter and I are doing it: “May-
be it’s this. But how could it be that? What’s underneath that? Well, underneath
that is this. Okay, but how could it be that? What’s underneath that?” And
somehow, if Peter and I are doing it correctly, when we’re all done, neither of us
will know anything we didn’t know before, but life will be an opening for that
into which we’ve inquired. So Peter and I will find ourselves, not remembering
what to do to be leaders, or not remembering what property we need to have
to be leaders, but rather we will find ourselves being leaders. . . . Because I say
that a well-designed, rigorous inquiry, while not leading to answers, while not
leading to information, while not leading necessarily to understanding, leads to
an opening, like a possibility, like a clearing, for that into which I’m inquiring.
ERHARD
No. Can’t see commitment. It’s not a presence. I don’t mean you can’t see it,
therefore it’s not a presence, but I’m trying to kind of engage you into: how do
you inquire into presence? So is commitment ever present? No, that’s always a
conversation, an assessment about what’s going on there. . . . What’s actually
going on there?
PETER
I don’t know.
ERHARD
Try this: something about unrestrained action? Maybe something like unre-
strained action, maybe something like consistent action? Maybe something like
repetitive action, maybe something like action powerful enough to meet a resis-
tance? I don’t know. See, I don’t know, and I don’t care about the answer! What
I care about is establishing ourselves in the domain of leadership as a presence.
That’s what this is all about. It’s a trick. This is not really to get the answer. We’re
not going to give you a test to see if you got the answers right aft erwards. . . .
PETER
It’s action without concern.
ERHARD
Okay. Good. Now, what does concern mean? See, no matter what he says, I’m
going to have a question, aren’t I? Why? Because I don’t care about the answer!

SPEAKING BEING
Erhard was on the platform as the second session began at 1:15 pm.
ERHARD
So I’m willing to tell you The Answer now. You’re not going to like the answer. What you get
after sitting on a mountaintop for twenty years—what you get is—the answer is that there
isn’t any answer: and that is The Answer. Somewhere on the third day that will fall into place
for you. What we want to do is distinguish a racket. The problem is that you don’t know what
distinguishing is. First we need to distinguish distinction. When you and I distinguish some-
thing, it’s not the same as defi ning it. Distinguishing and defi ning are two diff erent operations.
And distinguishing is not describing. When you distinguish something you are not describing it.
What is it that defi ning does? When you defi ne something, what does that do for you?
PARTICIPANT
You set up a boundary, or a limit.
ERHARD
Right on. When you defi ne something, what you do is to take a mass of undefi ned stuff , and
you draw a kind of line that divides what you’re defi ning from what you’re not defi ning. Also,
defi ning indicates something with reference to something else, something you’re not familiar
with in relation to something you are familiar with. Distinguishing doesn’t work like that.
Defi ning objectifi es something. When you defi ne something you turn it into an object. Defi ning
gives it a form, a location in space and time, turns it into a thing. And we’re all comfortable with
things. When you distinguish you don’t turn it into an object. And that’s why distinguishing
makes people uncomfortable. Because while it exists by virtue of being distinguished, it doesn’t
exist as a thing.
(pausing)
So we’re going to take a little bit of a look at what distinguishing might be. Defi ning identifi es;
distinguishing sets up a realm. You don’t need to understand that yet. Just have it like, “He says
distinguishing sets up a realm.” 2, and 9, and 74 are numbers. But number is not itself a num-
r
ber. It’s a realm in which numbers can happen. Number distinguishes a realm of possibility.
Erhard called on a participant to stand up.
ERHARD (to participant)t
How many loops in one square foot of rug?
PARTICIPANT
A couple thousand.
ERHARD
You know exactly how many: a lot. If I take one loop away, how many are there? The exact same
number. The number is called a lot. We can’t distinguish between that number and that number
minus one. A lot minus one is still a lot. You have no way to see the diff erence between a lot and
