Forum Day Four: Session Three 465
enough responsibility, and somebody’ll try to get close to me, and I’ll sit down. I’ll go on strike, 
I’ll dare them to do whatever...
(breaking out into extended laughter)
A lot of people I’ve worked with—I’ve not allowed them to support me. I never realized that I 
was just being my act about it. It never dawned on me that it was about being black and being 
right. How it occurred for me is that they didn’t really care about me; that they were out for 
their stuff . It wasn’t just who they are and who I am playing a game together. If I allowed in 
what this work does for people; that would destroy my racket. 
KIPP
And it would allow them to get the most out of you.
(laughter)
TRUMAN
Get the most out of me?
KIPP
Yeah. If this work gets the most out of people, it’ll get the most out of you.
TRUMAN (laughing)
Right, and I’m not interested in that.
(laughter)
I was sitting here. It was so funny. You were saying “Chocolate, choose.” And then it got funnier 
when I was thinking “Chocolate chip, choose.”
(laughter) 
KIPP
You all understand that all people are doing is sharing? All that’s happening is that people are 
sharing. And you’re so excited; you’re peeing in your pants here. This is really more than you 
ever bargained for in life. You never thought you could be a big enough person so that you could 
hear people and let people this deeply into your lives. Thank you.
DARRELL
My whole act has been kind of being afraid of people, and then when I realized I got into the 
conversation and saw that everybody is about as afraid of me as I am of them—that was a 
bright light for me. I’ve been Mr. Aloof, sitting back like I know it all, and just wouldn’t talk to 
anybody. I’ll just sit here looking like I’m in deep thought with myself and everyone will leave 
me alone.
