Forum Day Three: Session One

ERHARD
See, look. If she won the Nobel Prize that would be less important to her life than what she just
said. There’s nothing more important for her to say. Because once she can own that, there’s a
possibility beyond that. And until she can own that, there’s no possibility beyond that. All there
is, is shucking and jiving around that: one ploy after another ploy—trying not to be that way, to
fi nding out you are that way, giving in to being that way, making up your mind to be some other
way, trying not to be that way, fi xing being that way—it’s all a trap like having your foot nailed
to the fl oor and running around real fast.
BETTY
I’m going to fi x it.
KIPP
What do you mean by that? Because it’s going to be misheard.
BETTY
I’m going to fi x it by acknowledging my racket. When my racket goes to swing I’m going to
stop it. Because I’m not going to allow myself to pay the costs, just for me to be right and make
everyone wrong. Feel what I’m feeling. I’m going to take full control of it.
ERHARD
Most of that’s pretty good. A little “fi x it” in there; a little “stop it” in there. Most of it is
responsibility for it. And to the degree that she can be responsible for it, to the degree she can
be with it—be with it and be responsible for it—these words are synonymous, by the way—to the
degree that she can be responsible for it, to that degree she’s not limited to it. It’s not going to
go away. That’s who she is. That’s the identity she’s built for herself. It’s gonna be there forever.
And to the degree she can be with that, there’s a possibility beyond that. We’re too far into today
now, so I’m going to stop talking like that.
KIPP
What you’re present to is the distinction sharing. There’s no manipulation, no in-order-to.
That’s what sharing sounds like. This is what The Forum is about. So if you’re sitting in your
chair, if you’re with whatever’s happening in her life with yours, if there’s a harmony, if it
strikes a chord, then you should know that’s what this work is about. If you fi nd yourself in her
speaking—if you fi nd yourself in your life in her life—that’s what we’re doing here. Out of her
generosity—the truth is, out of her getting off  it—that’s what it sounds like when someone’s
getting off  it. She had no life. What she had was hate and resentment and bitterness, and
hate and resentment and bitterness were winning. We’re going to continue to distinguish this
distinction “sharing.”
SUSAN
I didn’t think you’d call on me.
Similarly, for Erhard, it is the in-order-to of the technological
clearing which diminishes our experience of truth:
“
. . .if you take something which is true and add
to it an “in order to” or even a “because” or
a “therefore,” you’ve changed it. And you’ve
changed it so dramatically that it’s no longer the
truth. It’s the truth used for something—to prove
d
something, to coerce others, to be right or make
someone else wrong. The truth used like that isn’t
the truth any more. It’s closer to a lie—something
pretending to be the truth. (Simon, ibid. 38, em-
phasis added)
Here we find ourselves in another instance of the reflexive thinking
that characterizes the work of both Erhard and Heidegger: even
attempts to escape in-order-to are undertaken in order to escape
in-order-to. Consequently, much of The Forum is devoted to the
distinction of a possibility beyond in-order-to. As Forum leader
Roger Armstrong told the Openings participants during this 1989
Forum, “To do one thing that’s not in-order-to” could be worth the
entire four days of The Forum. The paradox—embedded deeply in
Heidegger’s central distinction, appropriation—is that one can get
beyond in-order-to only by allowing and owning the inevitability of
in-order-to. ■

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
That’s what you get for thinking.
SUSAN
Well I called my husband last night, and he’s the one I thought had forced me to do it.
KIPP
Let’s get a little more rigorous. You had the thought...
SUSAN
Right. We were recently married in October. He participated in The Forum a couple of months
ago. When he came back from it he was so excited and he was great. He was excited about
our relationship—which was wonderful. But what really bothered me was that he said it was
because of The Forum. And that bugged me. My husband told me the reason he married me
was because of The Forum. That is a bunch of garbage; “You married me because you love me,
and there’s nobody who is making you marry me.” I went to Forum Introductory meetings and
didn’t like it because they wanted to work on me.
KIPP
No, you didn’t like it because you’re a creep.
SUSAN
Right. Yesterday I was sitting in here, and all these people have these major problems. I don’t
see a major problem in my life. And then I said, “my gosh, that’s one right there.”
KIPP (to the group)
That’s big. Some of you haven’t gotten here yet. Slow group.
SUSAN
As I developed it in my mind, I realized I got to share this, and so I put my hand up. “Now what
if he calls on me? I have to make sure I got this all planned out to say it right.” Then I realized:
I’m terrifi ed.
KIPP
That’s the point. The rest was fi ll. Keep going, please.
SUSAN
The thing that I came into The Forum to accomplish was to have the ability to fi nd the right
position. I just moved up here, and I don’t have a job yet. I wanted to wait until after the
holidays...
KIPP
Wait. What’s true is you don’t have a job yet.
