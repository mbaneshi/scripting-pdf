Forum Day Two: Session Three

JANE
I don’t understand about being complete with your parents.
WES
Are your parents all right with you the way they are?
JANE
Yeah.
WES
So what’s the problem?
ERHARD (gently)
Jane, there’s something going on with you about your parents, isn’t there?
JANE (very tentative)
I don’t know.
ERHARD
Does it feel like there is?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
So what’s going on?
JANE
I don’t know. Something from the past?
ERHARD
Is there something that feels badly for you?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
What is it?
JANE
The only thing I can think of is my stepmom, the way they brought her into my life.
THROWNNESS
Thrownness is a central Heideggerian term that Werner Erhard uses
extensively in responding to the first question of The Forum: What
is the Being of human beings?
In Being and Time, thrownness is a fundamental aspect of
Dasein’s existence; Erhard calls it “the default clearing” for human
beings (Author notes, Intro to 6-Day LA 1989). “In thrownness,”
says Heidegger “it is revealed that in each case Dasein, as my
Dasein and this Dasein, is already in a definite world and alongside
a definite range of definite entities within-the-world” (BT 264
T
).
Thrownness determines Dasein’s options in life, and there are no
others: “As something thrown, Dasein has been thrown into exis-
tence. It exists as an entity which has to be as it is and as it can be”
(BT 321
T
), and further, “it has been brought into its ‘there,’ but not
of its own accord” (BT 329
T
).
The word “thrownness” expresses the way we wound up
being, the way we find ourselves to always already be: thrownness
determines what we automatically are, and it limits our future
possibilities (what we “can be”). It is the ontological clearing which
Being has sent in our time. “We’ve got only the possibility which
we inherited,” says Erhard, “the possibility into which we were
thrown—we’re thrown to be this particular way, we’re thrown into
this kind of being that has this particular set of options” (“The
Heart of the Matter”).
Heidegger says that these options are not objective brute facts
about the environment into which we are thrown; that would be the
factuality of the situation, and we might discover those facts if we
y
looked for them. But Dasein’s thrownness “is meant to suggest the
facticity of its being delivered-over” (BT 174). We live in the facticity, the
T
way we
y
wound up being, and not the factuality; we don’t see the raw
data of the environment, we see a story about the world. This is our
y
facticity: that we are thrown, and that our thrownness is not deter-
mined by the things or circumstances “out there.” Rather it is char-
acteristic of Dasein’s way of Being-in-the-world. Dasein has wound
up whatever way it wound up being, and to perpetuate itself, Dasein
must avoid owning up to what it costs to self-justify this thrown way
of being. From the point of view of the way we
y
wound up being, then,

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
So let’s talk about that a bit. What happened?
JANE
My dad came home with her. He was gone for a while, and he said “this is your mom.” That’s it.
No questions.
ERHARD
And what did you say to yourself?
JANE
Fine.
ERHARD
Did you? Did you stuff  it?
JANE
Well I thought that maybe he brought her in so that I would have a mom, ’cause my parents got
a divorce, and then two months later my real mom died. And I feel like he brought her into my
life.
ERHARD
Is what you’re feeling badly about...
JANE
But my mom loves me. I’m glad for half the things she does. But at the time I thought, “she’s
such a bitch, why is she doing this?” And I wanted to just run away. Now I realize she loved me,
and that she wasn’t trying to replace my real mom.
ERHARD
Good. It doesn’t mean that your mother is not weird. Because we’re all weird, right, you’ve seen
that in here. But your mother loves you, and she’s weird. With your mother, it’s got to be that
she’s all right just like she is. I didn’t say she was right to be the way she is. My mother didn’t do
the stupid things she did with me because she loved me. She did the stupid things she did with
me because she was stupid. And she loved me. It’s not that she was right. So you’ve got a little
bit of a ploy in there about making your mother right for the way she is, you all. So, any better
sense of what that sadness is? Does it have to do with your mother and father’s divorce?
JANE
I don’t remember that.
ERHARD
Does it have to do with your mother dying?
ontological inquiry—the kind of speaking that evokes Being—occurs
as something to turn away from, to try to leap over.
Indeed, Heidegger is emphatic about the centrality of our
facticity in determining our existence. Our mood, our state-of-
mind, the way we understand our world—from the phenomeno-
logical perspective—those are the facts: “[M]ood brings Dasein
before the ‘that-it-is’ of its ‘there,’ which, as such, stares it in
the face with the inexorability of an enigma.” Even if Dasein
strives for “rational enlightenment,” tries for a detached stand-
point, and tells himself that, really, it’s just a mood—“all this
counts for nothing as against the phenomenal facts of the case”
(BT 175
T
).
Hubert Dreyfus, in his reading of Being and Time, chooses to
translate Heidegger’s Befindlichkeit as aff ectedness rather than state-
t
of-mind. The latter phrase, he feels, suggests a private subjective
mental state, when what Heidegger is distinguishing is Dasein’s
“being found in a situation where things and options already matter”
(Being In The World 168). This is an important point. In our thrown-
d
ness, things are encountered as already and always meaningful:
Letting something be encountered is primarily
circumspective; it is not just sensing some-
thing, or staring at it. It implies circumspec-
tive concern, and has the character of becom-
ing aff ected in some way. . . . Being-in as such
has been determined existentially beforehand
in such a manner that what it encounters
within-the-world can “matter” to it in this
way. (BT 176)
“
Heidegger’s point is that our moods, like our states of mind, are
not the subjective individual phenomena found in a Cartesian
model of human being. For Heidegger, a mood “comes neither
from the ‘outside’ or ‘inside,’ but arises out of Being-in-the-world,
as a way of such Being” (BT 176
T
).
Our thrown way of being is not one that we could make
explicit or theorize. It is not based upon beliefs, and human
