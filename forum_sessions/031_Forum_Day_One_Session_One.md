Forum Day One: Session One

being, but you didn’t make up human being. You didn’t invent being nervous. You didn’t invent
having a barrier to expressing yourself. That doesn’t belong to you. That’s not yours. That’s in
the already always being of human being. It doesn’t belong to you; you belong to it.
(forcefully)
It owns you! You don’t own it. Being nervous owns your life. You don’t own being nervous. The
metaphor is that there’s nothing personal about a rainstorm. It just rains, and I, you, personally
get wet. But the rainstorm didn’t rain in order to get me wet. Being nervous is already always
there in the being of being human. And you and I walk out into that rainstorm and get wet...
In The Forum, you get back the power to say something about your own way of being. Now
you can only report on it. But you can’t say “I’m not nervous” and have it make any diff erence.
After The Forum you will be able to.
BLAKE
I’m not as nervous as when I first stood up. I am here to make a change, find a new occupa-
tion, to get up in front of people. What it requires is getting up.
ERHARD
Not necessarily.
BLAKE
Well, I don’t know.
ERHARD
That’s right. And I do know.
BLAKE
That’s why I’m asking you.
ERHARD
I want to get it settled because you’re going to keep saying those stupid kinds of things: what
you have to do and what you don’t have to do for this to work. And the answer is you don’t
know. So I’m gonna tell you: what you have to do is what you do. So you’ll always know what
you have to do because you’re doing what you’re doing. To do something you’re not doing:
that’s bad. If you do what you do it’ll all work out. One of the things that you are doing is think-
ing you have to stand up. That’s fi ne for you to think that. You wanna know why I think it’s
fi ne for him to think that? Because that’s what he’s thinking.
BLAKE
You’re right. At some point you broke through whatever was in the way and now you’re up
there doing what you are doing.
The game in The Forum is the evocation of the presence
of Being, and The Forum leader’s opponent is the way of being
that we in the technological age have been born into (the way
we wound up being). Clearly, there is a certain direction which
must be maintained in The Forum dialogue if its purpose is
to be achieved. The maintenance of this direction in the face
of participants’ resistance might appear, to the everyday
understanding, as motivated by a need on The Forum leader’s
part to win the game, so that The Forum’s perspective is shown
to be the true one. However, accepted in The Forum is that The
Forum leader’s responsibility is maintaining the ontological
character of the conversation. “My job,” said Erhard, “is to
manage the dialogue.” This management is not a matter of
winning, but of keeping the way in view. In a recent conversation
with the authors, Erhard put it this way: “I used this way of
speaking to deal with people who are resisting in order to resist,
rather than functioning in a dialogue.”
Any discussion of dialogue as pedagogy must always consider
the question of mutuality, and this is especially delicate when the
dialogue’s purpose is the presencing of Being. The Forum leaders’
rank in The Forum dialogue is given by their ability to listen to
the conversation from a certain perspective. As Erhard told The
Forum leaders, “You’ve got to know that an authentic dialogue is
going to generate clarity. You’ve also got to watch you don’t get
hooked. What hooks [you] is when someone says something that
you think puts you at a disadvantage.” Being hooked, for a Forum
leader, means being drawn into argument or commiseration with
participants’ stories about their lives, rather than maintaining
the transformed perspective given by The Forum’s ontological
distinctions. It is The Forum leader’s job not to get hooked.
This balance between mutuality and directedness in an
ontological dialogue is an important matter. Obviously, there is
a thrust to such a dialogue—a movement of the conversation in
the direction of its ontological intention. In his dialogue with the
Japanese scholar in On the Way to Language, Heidegger points
to the nature of true dialogue when he states that “we may

SPEAKING BEING
BLAKE (pausing)
It’s really hard for me not to be funny.
ERHARD
Yeah. You’re already always funny.
BLAKE
And I don’t want to be silly or you’re going to get mad at me. It’s just a temptation to always be
funny.
ERHARD
It’s the way you avoid dealing with what you don’t want to deal with, which is being anything
but funny. That’s what you don’t want to deal with. You learned how to deal with being funny.
You got that down very well and the rest of it you’re a little nervous about. But you’re not ner-
vous about being funny, are you?
BLAKE
No.
ERHARD
And you’re not nervous about whatever your racket is either. You’re just nervous about the rest
of it. I know you don’t understand half of what we’re talking about, but that’s all right. Just the
fi rst couple hours.
BLAKE
I don’t want to be nervous anymore.
ERHARD
Somebody write that down for me.
BLAKE
I’m not a dictator and so I have to live with the things I’m not comfortable with, and when I’m
uncomfortable, other people are uncomfortable. I don’t like that.
ERHARD
Thanks... The next subject. Everybody ready for the next subject?
A participant named Charles, who was still concerned with the conversation about the rain, rose.
CHARLES
I’m with “it rains so that life is sustained.”
confidently entrust ourselves to the hidden drift of our
dialogue. . . as long as we remain inquirers” (“DL” in OWL 30,
emphasis added). In true dialogue—which always has an
unspoken ontological intent—the dialogue itself can be trusted to
move us along if we, as participants, continue to be a certain way.
Notice the reflexive nature of the process: simultaneous surrender
and evocation. In The Forum, the maintenance of this delicate
balance is The Forum leader’s task.
A central element of The Forum’s effectiveness is the
inclusiveness of its conversation: interactions between The Forum
leader and those participants who actively engage in the dialogue
are conducted in front of the entire group, so that even those
participants who are listening and observing are able to derive
the benefits of those interactions.
For both Heidegger and Erhard, a shared tendency of human
being underlies all of our diverse individual and cultural concerns.
The assumption of The Forum’s methodology is that a skillfully
managed dialogue between two people can affect the ontological
insight of others who are listening to that dialogue, and who share
the tendency of being that generates it.
A participant whose concern is her relationship with her
employer can recognize, in another participant’s discussion of his
problems with his mother, the same existential structure that is at
the source of her own problem. Thus The Forum leader regularly
exhorts participants to “listen from your own concerns.” ■
