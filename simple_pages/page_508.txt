SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
There would be the possibility of catching it and your actions would be consistent with catching 
it. Let me ask you a question: Have you ever seen a great athletic feat?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
If you don’t move, you don’t catch. Did you hear what I said?
MIKE
If you don’t move, you don’t catch.
ERHARD
Yeah. So. Guys who move have the possibility of catching. And you see them do things you 
thought were impossible. You get that now? Is that clear? You don’t move, you don’t catch. And 
you only move when the ball occurs as catchable. These are not guys calling for superhuman 
eff ort from themselves. These are guys who because of certain ways they are trained see a ball 
as catchable like a possibility, which you don’t see. You don’t catch the ball every time I throw it 
right there, do you?
MIKE
No, not every time.
ERHARD
Exactly, but you don’t move to catch the ball every time, when I throw it there. 
MIKE
Right. The occurring.
ERHARD
Got it?
MIKE
The occurring I don’t understand. 
ERHARD
How fast was that ball moving?
MIKE
Feet per minute?
ERHARD
You have no idea, right?
