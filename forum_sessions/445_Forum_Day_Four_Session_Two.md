Forum Day Four: Session Two

KIPP
Perfect! Why did you choose chocolate?
BILL
I chose chocolate... because I enjoy choosing chocolate.
KIPP (pulling out another tissue to a elongated “peep!”
(
)”
“I enjoy” is like a feeling, a thought, a consideration, a reason, isn’t it? It’s based on your enjoy-
ment. That reason came along and selected it again.
BILL
I do not know how to make a choice without... with using the word because. I must have missed
something.
KIPP
You didn’t miss anything. They are real glad it’s you up here, not them.
(applause)
When you come from life is empty and meaningless and you’re able to be with your racket,
choice opens up for you, but you don’t know anything about choice. Why we are working this
way is to distinguish something called choice, and a choice is based on nothing: It’s a pure
choice, simply because you choose. Chocolate/Vanilla: choose!
BILL (fi nally
(
)
I choose chocolate simply because I choose... chocolate.
The participants erupted in applause.
KIPP
The important thing is all his reasons, thoughts, feelings considerations, are still there, weren’t
they? See, you think you have to get rid of these...
(holding up all the tissues he had pulled out of the box)
In order to make a choice. No. They are all still there, except his choice isn’t based on these.
He has his reasons, his thoughts, his feelings, his considerations, but he’s not being those. He’s
being his choice. You think you have to get rid of all these, then you can make a choice. Yes?
BILL
I thought that way. I think that way.

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
So far that’s what’s been available for you, is you thinking that this is what you got for your life,
yes? If you can get enough of these lined up in one way or the other, it will give you the action
that you want.
BILL
Yes.
KIPP
Exactly. What’s been missing for you is the distinction choice, for you “Bill,” and for you “human
being.” It doesn’t come with being human. You don’t come equipped with that one. You’ve got to
invent that one. You want to test this now to make sure you and everybody else is clear about it?
BILL
Sure.
KIPP
Bill, why is the fl oor down there?
BILL (looking down)
It’s just there?
KIPP
It’s where? The fl oor is down there because...?
BILL (laughing)
It doesn’t choose to be there. That’s for sure.
KIPP
Good, Bill. So...?
BILL
Because it’s there.
KIPP
Where? The fl oor is down there because...?
BILL
Because the fl oor is down there.
KIPP
Let’s check this out a bit more.
