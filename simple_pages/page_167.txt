Forum Day Two: Session Three 
153
ERHARD
Okay. How long have you been suff ering and unhappy?
ANGEL
From what?
ERHARD
From the divorce. Did it take the second divorce?
ANGEL
Yeah. The suff ering and unhappiness was in the marriage.
ERHARD
But you put up with it.
ANGEL
I put up with a lot.
ERHARD
And that was good because somebody who cares more than anybody else in the world will put
up with a lot of shit. So it made you right to suff er in your marriage. Made you a good person. 
You know what doormats attract?
ANGEL
People who step on them.
ERHARD
Exactly. You got it. And you know what? A doormat keeps a person who wants to wipe his 
feet stuck to the doormat. You dominated him just as sure as I’m sitting on this platform. You 
dominated him by being the victim. Now, he had his racket as well—two racketeers rubbing up 
against each other. 
ANGEL
We had a great game.
ERHARD
It’s disgusting.
ANGEL
I couldn’t play without him.
ERHARD
Right.
