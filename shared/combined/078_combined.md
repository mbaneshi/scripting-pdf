SPEAKING BEING
Areas of Greatest Impact
Before attending the workshop, we asked participants to indicate areas where they felt they needed improvement. Very
few people felt they needed a great deal of improvement in many of the 68 areas we questioned. Yet after the workshop,
many participants realized that they could improve themselves and their job performance dramatically in ways they hadn’t
considered before the workshop. The ranking below shows the areas where the workshop had the greatest impact.
Being able to acknowledge mistakes fully and do what is necessary
to correct them.
Being fully committed to my company’s success.
Having high standards of quality for myself and the people who
work with me and for me.
Confronting difficult situations head-on instead of avoiding them.
Always listening carefully and attentively to other people at work.
Being as concerned with the performance of my department/division
and the company overall as I am with my own performance.
Always being responsive to the concerns of those who work for me.
Being quick to give recognition to others for the work they do.
Welcoming constructive criticism from others.
Being very effective in communicating work related issues with
my co-workers.
Being good at letting other people get all the credit they deserve.
Feeling free to be frank and open with those who report to me.

SPEAKING BEING
7:50 pm: Erhard’s manner was light and casual as he opened this session, interrupted by a number
of people who were returning late from the meal break. The first participant to stand shared that in
looking for issues to put at stake, he found that his issues were already big enough and did not feel
he needed to invent new ones. Erhard noticed an empty seat and began to manage people missing.
ERHARD
I made up my mind not to call you assholes any more, but I want you to know it’s very hard.
Speaking about issues and what you can have at stake...
(drawing a large circle on the chalkboard)
Let that circle represent everything there is to know. Everyone in The Forum is successful. We
know from independent studies of The Forum that participants are above average in their abil-
ity to succeed. So a certain amount of what is in this circle you know, and you know that you
know.
(drawing a small wedge in the circle)
What we do to be successful and able is we put what we know to use. That’s what common
sense tells us to do with what we know that we know. But there is also some stuff that we don’t
know, and know that we don’t know.
(adding a larger wedge)
The older I’ve gotten, the more I know I don’t know. Common sense tells us that to find out
what we know that we don’t know, we need to go to school, read a book, take a seminar. I’d
like you to see that you really fit that. The rest of the pie is what you don’t know that you don’t
know. What does common sense tell you to do about that? Nothing. Common sense is silent on
that subject. What The Forum is about is what you don’t know that you don’t know—what’s
behind you that you can’t see. The purpose of The Forum is to provide access to what you didn’t
know that you didn’t know. In independent surveys, people have reported that The Forum is the
single most dramatic learning experience in their life.
(drawing a point on the second chalkboard)
When you take a point, which has zero dimensions, and extend it into the first dimension, you
get a line.
(drawing a line extending from the point)
You don’t get a bigger and better point. Then, when you extend the line into the second dimen-
sion, you don’t get a bigger and better line: you get a plane.
(drawing out from the line to form a square)
And when you extend a two-dimensional plane into the third dimension, you don’t get a bigger
and better plane, you get a three dimensional figure, in this case, a cube.
(building from the square, Erhard drew a cube)
Almost invariably, the results of our life are results from extending ourselves on the same
dimension. But adding a new dimension is an exponential leap. You want to listen up here and
get this! The Forum doesn’t push out on the dimensions of living already available to you. What
FORUM DAY ONE:
SESSION FOUR
Forum Day One: Session Four
69
it does is add a dimension. So there’s an exponential leap in the possibility of Being. And that’s
maybe why there are these outrageous claims people make about what they got from participat-
ing in The Forum.
PARTICIPANT
Couldn’t you add a fourth slice to the pie? Intuition? What you know but don’t know that you
know.
ERHARD
Yes, that’s very legitimate. You didn’t get the point about dimensionality?
(adding it to the model on the board)
In a point, you have no degrees of freedom. In a line, one dimension, you get one degree of free-
dom, and so on, and we simply expand on that one degree of freedom. The Forum adds a new
dimension. You get an exponential leap of possibility.
PARTICIPANT
It’s what you don’t know that you don’t know.
ERHARD
Exactly.
PARTICIPANT
How do you get there?
ERHARD
You’re in here four days and one evening. You’ll see how it’s done by the end of the third day.
Anybody else here not get this dimensionality?
PARTICIPANT
Could you say that what The Forum does is to “unconceal” a new dimension?
ERHARD
Yes, that’s a technical term for it. It’s called unconcealing. What begins to get you into this
domain of “don’t know that you don’t know” is to dwell in the power of the question. We’re
hungry for answers, addicted to answers. People hate being in the question; they want the
answer. You don’t get answers. Light gets shed on what you are concerned with. That’s not the
way you and I are usually. The way you and I are is hungry for answers. What do I do about it?
The beginning of gaining access to what you don’t know that you don’t know, the beginning of
establishing a new dimension for being, a new dimension for living, is to start to dwell in the
question, develop the courage and the stamina and the wherewithal to orient yourself around
“
Can you formulate a question, the asking
of which is empowering? So that you’d be
willing to stay in the question?
70
SPEAKING BEING
questions the asking of which makes a difference. There are certain questions, just the asking of
which impacts people’s ability in life. See, you and I don’t look for those questions, we look for
answers, which you can only find in what you know that you don’t know. This is about devel-
oping questions the asking of which gives access to what you don’t know that you don’t know
about your life, about other people, and about living. The Forum is about developing a certain
muscle for asking questions the mere asking of which makes a difference.
Here Erhard read a passage from Heidegger’s On the Way to Language (page 13), in which Heidegger
recounts his dialogue with a Japanese scholar:
ERHARD (reading)
“Japanese: We Japanese do not think it strange if a dialogue leaves undefined what is really
intended...”
(to the group)
That’s not very familiar to most of us, is it? In our dialogues we want to get definition very
quickly. We want it explained.
(continuing to read)
“...or even restores it back to the keeping of the undefinable.
Inquirer: That is part, I believe, of every dialogue that has turned out well between thinking be-
ings. As if of its own accord, it can take care that that undefinable something not only does not
slip away, but displays its gathering force ever more luminously in the course of the dialogue.”
(to the group)
That means putting it back into “don’t know that you don’t know.” It’s a harmonic with what
I read you earlier about the unspoken. See, what you’re looking for here is light, not answers.
Insight you can’t create by the numbers. What you want if you’re going to create is light, not
answers. Listen up, goddammit!
(continuing to read)
“Our dialogues with Count Kuki probably failed to turn out so well. We younger men chal-
lenged him much too directly to satisfy our thirst for handy information.”
(to the group)
You’re here listening for answers. You’re listening for what we call “tips.” Nothing worthwhile in life
can be gotten there by ten steps. Or twenty steps. You can’t dance knowing where to put your feet.
(continuing to read)
“Inquirer: Thirst for knowledge and greed for explanations never lead to a thinking inquiry.
Curiosity is always the concealed arrogance of a self-consciousness that banks on a self-invent-
ed ratio and its rationality.”
(to the group)
What that all means is that this greed, this thirst, the question, “How am I going to use this?”—
that’s a product, according to this guy, of a concealed arrogance, an arrogance that everything
“
There are certain questions, just the asking of
which impacts people’s ability in life.
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day One: Session Four
71
in life that’s worth knowing is merely an extension of what I already know. But the truth is that
everything worth knowing is going to violate what you know.
(continuing to read)
“The will to know does not will to abide in hope before what is worthy of thought.”
(to the group)
I think all there is, is having thoughts. But there are certain things that if you stand in front of
them in a certain way, give you thinking. If you stand in front of things worthy of thought you
get thinking. Thinking is a dance with that about which you are thinking. When you stand in
front of questions worthy of thought, you get thinking. Now that’s tough, because we’re in the
rainstorm called “I think.” We’re all Cartesians. No one’s had an original thought since then
about thinking—at least not one that has gotten to you or me. You and I are still Cartesians. But
there are possibilities beyond Descartes. And they give you access to a new way of being that
you can’t get to—being the kind of person you already always are. We’re going to be thinking.
That’s the way The Forum works. It goes backwards.
PARTICIPANT
What about disciplines that promise “inner transcendence”?
ERHARD
Inner transcendence. That’s what California is about. I don’t want to insult your pet project,
but I am not a guy in a diner about getting someplace. And you aren’t going to get there leaping
over being human. There’s no possibility of being beyond what you already always are until you
own what you already always are. Californians don’t like that. Californians have this magical
bullshit they believe in. That’s not the way The Forum works. The Forum’s got two pieces to it.
The first is an inquiry into the already always being of human being. What kind of an opening
are you for life? What’s the color of the clearing you are for life? To say that more rigorously:
what is the already always condition of being for human beings? What did you get yourself
into here? Not your individual version of being human. That’s the question of ninety percent of
The Forum. That’s called going backwards. It’s about owning yourself as you already are. Being
authentic about inauthenticity is particularly frightening for Californians. We don’t want to be
inauthentic. Why? Because it looks bad. And I don’t like looking bad. And your life is about
looking good. This is moving backwards to own what I already always am. This is not individ-
ualistic except that each of us has his or her own version, we got wet in this rainstorm called
human being. What is it to be a human being? See, people don’t ask that question. They want to
be thinner, younger, sexier. Those questions don’t give thinking. Because it is a question worthy
of thought it creates the possibility of thinking.
The Forum is two questions. The first: what is the already always being of human beings? Being
human owns you. It gives you your life. The second half of The Forum is another question. The
second question is, what is the possibility of being for human beings? What’s possible beyond
what I was given to be? I did what’s called in Zen the low road. In the low road you must do
everything that doesn’t work. So I’m not a guy in a diner about the low road. Most people want
“
There’s no possibility of being beyond what
you already always are until you own what
you already always are.

ساعت 7:50 بعد از ظهر: با افتتاح این جلسه ، شیوه ارهارد سبک و گاه به گاه بود.
از افرادی که دیر از استراحت غذا برمی گردند. اولین شرکت کننده ای که در آن ایستاده بود در آن به اشتراک گذاشت
به دنبال مسائلی که می خواست در معرض خطر قرار بگیرد ، دریافت که مسائل وی از قبل به اندازه کافی بزرگ است و احساس نمی کند
او نیاز به اختراع موارد جدید داشت. ارهارد متوجه صندلی خالی شد و شروع به مدیریت افراد مفقود کرد. درز
من فکر کردم که دیگر به شما زنگ نزنید ، اما می خواهم بدانید که این بسیار سخت است. صحبت در مورد مسائل و آنچه می توانید در معرض خطر قرار دهید ... (ترسیم یک دایره بزرگ روی تخته سیاه)
بگذارید آن حلقه نمایانگر همه چیز باشد که باید بدانید. همه در این انجمن موفق هستند. ما
از مطالعات مستقل از انجمن می دانید که شرکت کنندگان در مواردی بالاتر از حد متوسط ​​هستند
برای موفقیت بنابراین مقدار مشخصی از آنچه در این حلقه است که می دانید ، و می دانید که شما
می دانید (ترسیم یک گوه کوچک در دایره)
کاری که ما برای موفقیت و توانایی انجام می دهیم این است که آنچه را که می دانیم استفاده کنیم قرار می دهیم. این مشترک است
حس به ما می گوید با آنچه می دانیم می دانیم انجام دهیم. اما مواردی نیز وجود دارد که ما نمی کنیم
بدانید ، و بدانید که ما نمی دانیم. (اضافه کردن گوه بزرگتر)
هرچه پیرتر شده ام ، بیشتر می دانم که نمی دانم. عقل سلیم به ما می گوید که برای پیدا کردن
آنچه می دانیم که نمی دانیم ، باید به مدرسه برویم ، یک کتاب بخوانیم ، یک سمینار بگیریم. من
مثل شما می بینید که واقعاً متناسب با آن هستید. بقیه پای همان چیزی است که شما نمی دانید که نمی کنید
می دانید عقل سلیم به شما چه می گوید در مورد آن چه کاری انجام دهید؟ هیچی عقل سلیم در سکوت است
آن موضوع آنچه در مورد این انجمن است این است که شما نمی دانید که نمی دانید - چه چیزی است
پشت سر شما که نمی توانید ببینید. هدف این انجمن فراهم کردن دسترسی به آنچه شما نیستید
بدانید که شما نمی دانید. در نظرسنجی های مستقل ، مردم گزارش داده اند که این انجمن است
مجرد ترین تجربه یادگیری در زندگی خود. (ترسیم یک نقطه در تخته گچ دوم)
وقتی یک نکته را می گیرید ، که دارای ابعاد صفر است و آن را به بعد اول ، شما گسترش می دهید
یک خط دریافت کنید. (ترسیم خطی که از نقطه امتداد دارد)
شما یک نکته بزرگتر و بهتر ندارید. سپس ، هنگامی که خط را به بعد دوم گسترش می دهید-
سیون ، شما یک خط بزرگتر و بهتر نمی گیرید: هواپیما می گیرید. (بیرون کشیدن از خط برای تشکیل یک مربع)
و هنگامی که یک هواپیمای دو بعدی را به بعد سوم گسترش می دهید ، بزرگتر نمی شوید
و هواپیمای بهتر ، شما یک چهره سه بعدی دریافت می کنید ، در این حالت یک مکعب. (ساختمان از میدان ، Erhard یک مکعب را ترسیم کرد)
تقریباً همواره ، نتایج زندگی ما نتیجه ای از گسترش خود در همان است
بعد اما اضافه کردن یک بعد جدید یک جهش نمایی است. شما می خواهید اینجا گوش دهید و
این را دریافت کنید! این انجمن به ابعاد زندگی که از قبل در دسترس شما است ، فشار نمی آورد. چه
روز اول انجمن:
جلسه چهارم
روز اول انجمن: جلسه چهارم

این کار اضافه کردن یک بعد است. بنابراین یک جهش نمایی در امکان وجود وجود دارد. و این
شاید به همین دلیل این ادعاهای ظالمانه وجود دارد که مردم در مورد آنچه از مشارکت دریافت کرده اند ، مطرح می کنند-
در انجمن شرکت کننده
آیا نمی توانید یک برش چهارم را به پای اضافه کنید؟ شهود؟ آنچه می دانید اما نمی دانید که شما
می دانید درز
بله ، این بسیار قانونی است شما در مورد ابعاد این نکته را پیدا نکردید؟ (اضافه کردن آن به مدل روی صفحه)
در یک نقطه ، شما هیچ درجه ای از آزادی ندارید. در یک خط ، یک بعد ، شما یک درجه رایگان دریافت می کنید-
دام ، و غیره ، و ما به سادگی در یک درجه آزادی گسترش می یابیم. این انجمن جدید اضافه می کند
بعد شما یک جهش نمایی از امکان دریافت می کنید. شرکت کننده
این چیزی است که شما نمی دانید که نمی دانید. درز
دقیقاً شرکت کننده
چگونه به آنجا می رسید؟ درز
شما چهار روز و یک شب در اینجا هستید. خواهید دید که چگونه این کار تا پایان روز سوم انجام شده است. شخص دیگری در اینجا این ابعاد را دریافت نمی کند؟ شرکت کننده
آیا می توانید بگویید که انجمن چه کاری انجام می دهد "عدم وجود" یک بعد جدید؟ درز
بله ، این یک اصطلاح فنی برای آن است. آن را ناشناخته می نامند. چه چیزی شروع به ورود شما به این کار می کند
دامنه "نمی دانم که شما نمی دانید" این است که در قدرت سوال زندگی کنید. ما هستیم
گرسنه برای پاسخ ، معتاد به پاسخ. مردم از بودن در این سوال متنفر هستند. آنها می خواهند
جواب شما جواب نمی دهید نور به آنچه نگران هستید ریخته می شود. این نیست
من و شما معمولاً هستیم. روشی که من و شما گرسنه برای پاسخ هستیم. در مورد آن چه کار می کنم؟ آغاز دسترسی به آنچه شما نمی دانید که نمی دانید ، آغاز
ایجاد یک بعد جدید برای هستی ، یک بعد جدید برای زندگی ، شروع به ساکن شدن در
سؤال کنید ، شجاعت و استقامت و هر کجا که خود را در اطراف خود قرار دهید ، توسعه دهید
"
آیا می توانید یک سوال را تدوین کنید ، پرسیدن
که از آن توانمند است؟ تا شما باشید
آیا مایل به ماندن در سوال هستید؟ 70
وجود
سؤال از پرسیدن آن تغییر می کند. سوالات خاصی وجود دارد ، فقط پرسیدن
که بر توانایی افراد در زندگی تأثیر می گذارد. ببینید ، من و شما به دنبال آن سؤالات نیستیم ، ما به دنبال آن هستیم
پاسخ ها ، که فقط می توانید در آنچه می دانید که نمی دانید پیدا کنید. این در مورد توسعه است-
سؤال از پرسیدن این سؤال که به آنچه شما نمی دانید نمی دانید که نمی دانید
در مورد زندگی شما ، در مورد افراد دیگر و زندگی. این انجمن در مورد توسعه یک خاص است
عضله برای پرسیدن سوالات صرفاً پرسیدن آن باعث تغییر می شود. در اینجا Erhard بخشی از هایدگر را در راه زبان (صفحه 13) خوانده است ، که در آن هایدگر
گفتگوی خود را با یک محقق ژاپنی بازگو می کند:
erhard (خواندن)
"ژاپنی: ما ژاپنی ها فکر نمی کنیم عجیب باشد اگر گفتگوی تعریف نشده باشد که واقعاً چیست
در نظر گرفته شده ... "
(به گروه)
این برای اکثر ما خیلی آشنا نیست ، اینطور است؟ در گفتگوهای ما می خواهیم تعریف کنیم
سریع ما می خواهیم توضیح داده شود. (ادامه خواندن)
"... یا حتی آن را به نگه داشتن غیرقابل توصیف بازگرداند. پرس و جو: این بخشی است ، به اعتقاد من ، از هر گفت و گو که بین تفکر خوب بوده است
ings به نظر می رسد که اگر از توافق خودش باشد ، می تواند مراقبت کند که چیزی غیرقابل توصیف نه تنها انجام نمی دهد
از بین برود ، اما در جریان گفتگو ، نیروی جمع آوری خود را به طرز درخشان تر نشان می دهد. "
(به گروه)
این بدان معنی است که آن را دوباره به "نمی دانید که نمی دانید." این یک هارمونیک با چه است
من قبلاً شما را در مورد ناگفته خواندم. ببینید ، آنچه در اینجا به دنبال آن هستید سبک است ، نه پاسخ. بینشی که نمی توانید با اعداد ایجاد کنید. آنچه می خواهید اگر می خواهید ایجاد کنید سبک است ، نه
پاسخ ها گوش کن ، خدای! (ادامه خواندن)
"گفتگوهای ما با Count Kuki احتمالاً نتوانست خیلی خوب ظاهر شود.
او را بیش از حد مستقیماً برای برآورده کردن عطش ما برای اطلاعات مفید ، لنگه کرد. "

شما اینجا به دنبال پاسخ ها هستید. شما در حال گوش دادن به آنچه ما "نکات" می نامیم. هیچ چیز ارزشمند در زندگی نیست
با ده قدم می توان به آنجا رسید. یا بیست قدم شما نمی توانید رقصید و بدانید که پاهای خود را کجا بگذارید. (ادامه خواندن)
"پرس و جو: عطش دانش و حرص و آز برای توضیحات هرگز منجر به تحقیق تفکر نمی شود. کنجکاوی همیشه استکبار پنهان از خودآگاهی است که بانک ها بر روی یک خودت
نسبت اد و عقلانیت آن. "
(به گروه)
این همه معنی این است که این حرص و آز ، این عطش ، این سؤال ، "چگونه می توانم از این استفاده کنم؟" -
به گفته این مرد ، این یک استکبار پنهان ، یک استکبار است که همه چیز است

سوالات خاصی وجود دارد ، فقط پرسیدن
که بر توانایی افراد در زندگی تأثیر می گذارد. erhard (ادامه)
روز اول انجمن: جلسه چهارم

در زندگی که ارزش دانستن آن را دارد صرفاً گسترش آنچه من قبلاً می دانم است. اما حقیقت این است که
هر آنچه که ارزش دانستن آن را دارد ، نقض آنچه می دانید است. (ادامه خواندن)
"اراده برای دانستن ، پیش از آنچه که شایسته اندیشه است ، به امید پیروی نمی کند."

من فکر می کنم همه چیز وجود دارد ، داشتن افکار است. اما موارد خاصی وجود دارد که اگر جلوی آن بایستید
آنها را به روشی خاص ، به شما فکر می کند. اگر در مقابل چیزهایی که شایسته فکر شما هستند ایستاده اید
فکر کردن فکر کردن رقص با آن است که در مورد آن فکر می کنید. وقتی ایستاده اید
جلوی سؤالاتی که شایسته فکر است ، فکر می کنید. اکنون این کار سخت است ، زیرا ما در
طوفان باران به نام "من فکر می کنم". همه ما دکارتی هستیم. از آن زمان هیچ کس فکر اصلی را نداشت
در مورد فکر کردن - حداقل کسی نیست که به شما یا من رسیده باشد. من و شما هنوز دکارتی هستیم. اما
امکاناتی فراتر از دکارت وجود دارد. و آنها به شما امکان دسترسی به یک روش جدید برای این امر را می دهند
شما نمی توانید به نوع شخصی که همیشه همیشه هستید برسید. ما فکر می کنیم این روشی است که انجمن کار می کند. به عقب می رود. شرکت کننده
در مورد رشته هایی که نوید "تعالی درونی" را می دهند چیست؟ درز
متعالیه درونی. این چیزی است که کالیفرنیا در مورد آن است. من نمی خواهم به پروژه حیوان خانگی شما توهین کنم ،
اما من یک پسر در یک غذاخوری در مورد گرفتن جایی نیستم. و شما نمی خواهید به آنجا جهش کنید
بیش از انسان بودن هیچ امکان فراتر از آنچه که همیشه همیشه وجود دارد وجود ندارد
آنچه را که همیشه همیشه هستید کالیفرنیایی ها این را دوست ندارند. کالیفرنیایی ها این جادویی را دارند
آنها به آنها اعتقاد دارند. این نحوه عملکرد انجمن نیست. این انجمن دو قطعه به آن رسیده است. اولین تحقیق در مورد همیشه موجود در انسان است. چه نوع دهی
آیا شما برای زندگی هستید؟ رنگ پاکسازی شما برای زندگی چیست؟ برای گفتن دقیق تر:
شرط بودن همیشه برای انسان چیست؟ خودت چی شدی
به اینجا؟ نه نسخه فردی شما از انسان بودن. این سوال نود درصد است
انجمن این به عقب می رود. این در مورد مالکیت خودتان است که قبلاً هستید. وجود
معتبر در مورد عدم اطمینان برای کالیفرنیایی ها به ویژه وحشتناک است. ما نمی خواهیم باشیم
غیر معتبر چرا؟ چون بد به نظر می رسد و من دوست ندارم بد به نظر برسم. و زندگی شما در مورد است
خوب به نظر می رسد این به عقب در حال حرکت است تا آنچه را که من همیشه هستم داشته باشم. این جداگانه نیست
Ualistic به جز اینکه هر یک از ما نسخه خود را داریم ، ما در این طوفان باران به نام خیس شدیم
انسان یک انسان بودن چیست؟ ببینید ، مردم این سؤال را نمی پرسند. آنها می خواهند
نازک تر ، جوان تر ، جنسی تر باشید. این سؤالات تفکر نمی دهند. زیرا این یک سوال شایسته است
فکر این امکان تفکر را ایجاد می کند. این انجمن دو سوال است. مورد اول: همیشه موجود در انسان چیست؟ وجود
انسان صاحب شما است. این زندگی شما را به شما می دهد. نیمه دوم انجمن سؤال دیگری است. در
سوال دوم این است که امکان بودن برای انسان چیست؟ آنچه فراتر از آن وجود دارد
آنچه به من داده شد؟ من کاری را انجام دادم که در Zen Low Road خوانده می شود. در جاده کم شما باید انجام دهید
همه چیز کار نمی کند. بنابراین من یک پسر در یک غذاخوری در مورد جاده پایین نیستم. بیشتر مردم می خواهند
"
امکان فراتر از آنچه وجود ندارد
شما در حال حاضر همیشه هستید تا اینکه صاحب آنچه هستید
شما همیشه همیشه هستید.
