Forum Day Three: Session Two 201
commitments of The Forum is to unconceal the entire design of human being. Something very
powerful occurs, transformation occurs when you can actually be present to the design: human
being. What we want to confront, near the source of the design “human being,” is what is your
fundamental point of view and relationship to life? Life is really composed of other people.
What we’re really asking is, what’s the fundamental relationship to other people?
At this point, Wes called two participants to come to the chalkboards.
WES
We’re going to start with the question, what is the fundamental point of view of human beings
for life? Your fundamental point of view toward life occurs in a very simple statement. I’m not
interested in your complicated philosophies. Call out, “Life is —”
The group began calling out responses, and as they did so, the two participants at the boards wrote
the answers: hard, change, imperfect, me, a problem, survival, dangerous, fun, experiences, etc.
WES
When you’re being in life, what’s really there?
Various participants called out: “Imperfect. Hard. Quest for knowledge. Change. Problem. Me.
Evolvement. Survival. Dangerous. Not fair. Getting by. Threatening. Fun. Continual state of
learning...”
WES
A lot of this is bullshit—When you’re being in life. “Continual state of learning” is conceptual.
That’s not you walking down the street having to deal with the street. See, there’s you, and
there’s it... everything else. Isn’t that a fundamental division? There’s you and then there’s “it.” I
want to know your relationship to “it.” When you’re present to you and “it,” what’s there, like a
presence?
People continued to call out answers which were written on the board: I’ll show it, impressing
it, struggle, approval, hide from it, it’s fucked and I’ll never fi x it, separation, dealing with stupid
people, life can hurt you, etc.
WES (continuing)
Your relationship to “it” is struggle, and “it” is going to win. It will. You don’t live like that.
“It” is bigger. You’re going to die. Your life is about a relationship to “it,” to prevent dying, and
“it” is going to win. You don’t live like that. You know it. People forget how they originated.
You’re dealing with “it,” but in a way that you’re going to lose. The fundamental point of
view upon emerging into noise and cold and pain at birth: life is about avoiding the threat.
Life is dangerous. It’s threatening. Life is a threat. How do you respond? Survive. Life is about
surviving the threat that life is. That’s the already always way it is. That’s what you inherited.
That’s what you joined. You didn’t choose it. And you are it. Some of you are dealing with
danger by getting “its” approval. Some of you are dealing with danger by fl attering “it.” Some
Dasein constantly surrenders itself to the
‘world’ and lets the ‘world’ “matter” to it in
such a way that somehow Dasein evades its
very self. (

Attunements disclose thrownness in such a way as to conceal it;
thrownness is disclosed in the manner of an evasive turning-away
(BT 175). It’s there but we don’t want to look.
Closely related to an attunement is a mood, which may be
seen as the attunement’s affective dimension—the ontic
manifestation in human experience of an ontological condition
that remains in the background. We are never free of moods,
whether intense or pallid. But nothing like a mood could occur
for us, says Heidegger,
if Being-in-the-world, with its state-of-mind
[Befindlichkeit], had not already submitted
itself to having entities within-the-world “mat-
ter” to it in a way which its moods have outlined
in advance. (BT 177, emphasis added)
“
A mood arises from an attunement. So while we generally ascribe
the cause of a mood to the circumstances, Heidegger suggests that
we always already have a relationship with the world that evokes
our particular moods. Our unwillingness to confront this situation
leaves us stuck as the victim of the circumstances. It leaves us
going through the motions of a life that is not our own, and thus
we are immersed in an inauthentic existence.
But in certain attunements, Heidegger saw the possibility for
an authentic human experience of Being. Some moods, he saw,
have more significant potential for prompting such a disclosive
experience. The prerequisite is that the mood evoke a shift  of focus:
we must become present to the world, rather than to those specific
things in the world with which we are concerned.
Generally, in our everyday preoccupations, we seem to “cling
to this or that particular being.” But at some level, says Heidegger,
we are always dealing with beings as a whole. This does not mean
assuming a detached “objective” stance toward the populace; it is
rather an element of our attunements:

SPEAKING BEING
of you are dealing with danger by being smart. Some of you are dealing with danger by being
successful. Your racket is your way of dealing with the danger that life is. I want you to consider
the possibility that along with this fundamental point of view there is an experience of living,
which is almost never acknowledged by people. It’s totally suppressed, but it runs your life. It
runs your relationships with other people. Ask yourself, why do I have to have a racket? What’s
it covering over? What’s driving it?
LOTTIE
I’m so tough I don’t need anybody. I’m supposed to know and if I don’t know then I’m not
tough.
WES
What does that cover over?
LOTTIE
That I’m a woman.
WES
What’s the experience underneath that?
LOTTIE
That I’m a sexual being; that I’m not supposed to want it.
WES
Are you scared of sex?
LOTTIE (reluctantly)
Yes.
WES
You see, she couldn’t even say it. Couldn’t acknowledge it. And this is a woman who was really
trying to say it, but it was horrifying to even acknowledge that she’s scared of it—because she’s
tough. Tough people are never afraid.
LOTTIE
I just about died at the thought that it could be a part of my life.
WES
Got it. Great. Thanks.
(applause)
Other participants shared their answers and as they did so Wes indicated the fear that underlay
each one: “I’m afraid I’ll get taken advantage of”; “I’m terrifi ed of being alone”; “I’m afraid of being
Why do such moods give a possibility of authentic self-disclosure?
Remember, we are questioning aft er the background, the
determinative context for the everyday. Heidegger calls it the nothing,
but it generally occurs for us as something, and we resist it. If we are
moved to seek it, however, where can we look? Heidegger’s response:
In the end an essential distinction prevails
between comprehending the whole of beings in
themselves and finding oneself in the midst of
beings as a whole. The former is impossible in
principle. The latter happens all the time in our
existence. (“WM” in BW 99, emphasis added)
“
If the nothing itself is to be questioned as we
have been questioning it, then it must be given
beforehand. We must be able to encounter it.
Where shall we seek the nothing? . . . The total-
ity of beings must be given in advance so as to
be able to fall prey straightway to negation—in
which the nothing itself would then be mani-
fest. (“WM” in BW 98, emphasis added)
“
But for the background to be disclosed, it must become the
foreground: our presence to the whole must occur as salient.
This shift may happen, for example, in the mood of boredom:
No matter how fragmented our everyday exis-
tence may appear to be, [. . .] it always deals with
beings in a unity of the “whole,” if only in a shad-
owy way. Even and precisely when we are not
actually busy with things or ourselves, this “as
a whole” overcomes us—for example in genuine
boredom. . . . Profound boredom, drift ing here
and there in the abysses of our existence, like a
muff ling fog, removes all things and human be-
ings and oneself along with them into a remark-
able indiff erence. This boredom reveals beings as
a whole. (“WM” in BW99)
“
It is the function of The Forum to make present the totality of beings
so that it can be cleared through negation.
