Forum Day Three: Session Four

going to be all right. You know how it’s going to be? Just like this. Yeah, it’s not gonna be all right.
It’s going to be like this. You’re either going to make it like this or you aren’t going to make it.
You’re either going to learn to be in prison or you’re just going to be unhappy. You’re going to be
in prison one way or the other. So, why did we talk about empty and meaningless if it isn’t going
to be useful? Because the truth has power not predicated on being useful. The truth has power,
which most people can’t see. You want to get this because Lucy’s question opens this up. The
truth has power, which you can’t see, because you’re only looking for what’s useful. You’re not
looking for power, you’re looking to exploit, to use, to consume. So you can’t see the power of the
truth. So Lucy, what I said was, that the truth has a power that, if you’re only looking for what
you can use, you can’t see. That’s why we had that whole thing about empty and meaningless.
LUCY
I can think of a way that “life being empty and meaningless” can be of use to us and giving us
power.
ERHARD (to the group)
Am I demonstrating my point?
LUCY
One of the many alternatives I can think of...
ERHARD (to the group)
You want to listen to this.
LUCY
I think it revolves around the issue of performance versus expectation and if we tell ourselves
often enough that life is empty and meaningless, our expectations as a consequence would be
set lower over time, potentially...
ERHARD
No.
LUCY
And performance of life relative to expectations, could make us...
ERHARD
That’s wonderful. You ought to do a seminar on that. People would buy that. Look, they bought
thinking positive big. Yeah, I expect there to be a seminar—if you don’t do it, somebody will. So
you ought to do it: The Empty and Meaningless seminar, the purpose of which is to lower your
expectations far enough down that anything feels like winning.
(applause and laughter)
You’re actually having fun with me, aren’t you? She doesn’t mean this, she’s only joking with
me. She’s kidding me. She’s not looking for the answer. She knows there’s no answer. She’s only
kidding with me.
“
...the truth has a power that, if you’re only
looking for what you can use, you can’t
see.

SPEAKING BEING
LUCY
Well, I disagree. I really do. Because I think everything is a state of mind.
ERHARD
Oh absolutely. You go out and tell the bus that. Lucy, you’ve been in too many success seminars.
Everything is not a state of mind. Buses are not a state of mind. I don’t care what anybody has
told you. And the evidence is all on my side.
(responding to a participant not on camera)
Excuse me?
(repeating thoughtfully what the participant said)
A new suit of clothes for the king. Yes. My tongue’s way more tied than yours is; you can’t out
tongue tie me. Yeah, I understand what you said. I was just trying to get it. Yeah, what about it?
(repeating what the participant said—who does not have a microphone)
Is that all in the mind?
(addressing himself out loud)
Let’s see, am I going to give him the truth or just shut him up?
(laughter)
It’s all in the mind.
(laughter. Then seriously)
To stop being a smart-ass about this, I will respond to you. Yes, it is what you and I ordinarily
call “in the mind,” but if we look a little closer, it is not in the mind, it was in the mouth. A suit
of clothes is a conversation, not a mental image. But that is a fi ne point and your point is valid.
Buses are not a suit of clothes, right? It’s not all in the mind.  A lot of people think buses are in
the mind. And they look like they’ve been hit by buses.
(to Lucy)
You all done?
LUCY
Yes, I’m done.
ERHARD
Okay great!
(applause as Lucy sits )
