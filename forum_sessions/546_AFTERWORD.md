AFTERWORD
WERNER ERHARD,
MARTIN HEIDEGGER, A N D
THE POLITICS OF BEING
By Michael E. Zimmerman
Michael E. Zimmerman was a philosophy professor at Tulane University and the University of
Colorado at Boulder before retiring in 2015. Author of four books, and more than a hundred
articles and book chapters, Zimmerman‚Äôs research interests include environmental philosophy,
Heidegger, Nietzsche, Buddhism, and integral theory. His books include Eclipse of the Self (1981),
Heidegger‚Äôs Confrontation with Modernity (1990),
y
Contesting Earth‚Äôs Future (1994), and Integral
Ecology (2009).

Reading Bruce Hyde and Drew Kopp‚Äôs insightful book, Speaking Being, has been a
remarkable journey, one that brings me back to the transformation I experienced
when I took The est Training in December 1981. During the Training, I discovered a
t
profound and wholly unanticipated connection between the work of Werner Erhard
and that of Martin Heidegger. In spring 1982, I would find myself writing a philo-
sophical appraisal of the Training at Erhard‚Äôs request. This appraisal and related
conversations were two of many factors that eventuated in The Forum, which rolled
out in 1985.
Erhard developed the key elements of what would become The Forum (and
later, The Landmark Forum) long before he knew anything about Heidegger. The
point of Speaking Being is not to show that Erhard‚Äôs ideas derive from Heidegger‚Äôs,
but rather that there is a remarkable aff inity between ideas that the two thinkers
arrived at independently. The first question I will explore at length is this: Do the
remarkable parallels between the work of Erhard and Heidegger confirm the validity
of their respective findings?
Some autobiographical comments will help to contextualize my answer. Al-
though I eventually wrote two books and dozens of scholarly articles about Heide-
gger‚Äôs philosophy, my first encounter with it was an abject failure. In spring 1968,
as a senior philosophy major in college, I took a seminar on Being and Time (1927),
Heidegger‚Äôs most important work. I was feeling confident because the previous
semester I had apparently managed to make a little sense of Alfred North White-
head‚Äôs Process and Reality (1927), a notoriously diff icult text. The title of Heidegger‚Äôs
y
book attracted me, as did its cover, with large white letters standing against a black
background. The seminar was over my head, although I was hardly alone in my
confusion. Little secondary literature in English was available on Being and Time,
which had been translated only a few years earlier. Aft er struggling to about page
180, I realized that I had understood nothing about what was going on‚Äîespecially
not how important ‚Äúnothing‚Äù was to prove in Being and Time.
As a graduate student at Tulane University, I gave Being and Time another try,
this time in a seminar taught by Edward G. Ballard, who later became my disser-
tation director. In that seminar, I began to chip away at Heidegger‚Äôs conceptual
massif. Later, as a Fulbright-Hays Fellow in Belgium in 1972‚Äì73, I worked on my PhD
f
dissertation, ‚ÄúThe Concept of the Self in Heidegger‚Äôs Being and Time.‚Äù Ballard was
enamored of Plato‚Äôs thinking because it combined philosophical depth with the pos-
sibility of transformation for the one who engages wholeheartedly with the Platonic
dialectic. Such a transformation, so Ballard maintained, is necessary to understand
what Plato was pointing at.

Gradually, I concluded that the same was true for making sense of Being and
Time.1 (And later I found undergoing a transformative experience was also required
to truly understand Erhard‚Äôs est Training program and later The Forum program.) To
t
understand the book meant doing more than writing intelligible sentences about its
oft en diff icult and controversial ideas. I needed to undergo the anxiety (Angst
(
) that
discloses human existence as neither a body nor even a mind, but instead as the
temporal clearing or openness in which things can manifest themselves and in that
sense can ‚Äúbe.‚Äù Surrendering to the mood of anxiety, however, is akin to a death
experience, from which we ordinarily flee. Heidegger‚Äôs concept of authentic human
existence, at least so I argued in Eclipse of the Self, amounts to the following.2 One
must own up to the fact that one has been thrown into the world as the mortal, tem-
poral openness required for entities to reveal themselves in various ways. Anxiety
invites us to suspend momentarily our absorption into the average, everyday way of
existing (for Erhard, this includes what he would call ‚Äúrunning one‚Äôs racket‚Äù), so that
otherwise hidden possibilities‚Äîspecific to our own capacities and situations‚Äîcan
reveal themselves. Heidegger insisted, however, as does Erhard, that taking a stand
upon one‚Äôs own finite possibilities is not only unusual, but also diff icult to sustain.
We tend to fall back again and again into the tranquillizing mode of everyday life, in
which there is supposedly nothing really new or important to be discovered.
One day in the early 1970s, while a grad student at Tulane, I had a full-blown
anxiety moment that began as I was walking through the University Center. All
of a sudden, the people, furniture, floor and ceiling began pulling away from me.
Everyone and everything became utterly meaningless, insignificant, and pointless.
My projects, self-understanding, goals and objectives‚Äîthese, too, fell away, leaving
only bare, unmotivated, directionless awareness. The world had become empty and
meaningless. Aft er a while, things started to regain their significance, such that I was
able to find my way around once again. This experience confirmed for me much of
what Heidegger had said about anxiety in Being and Time and elsewhere.
The occasion for another important insight occurred in early January 1978 on a
dark and stormy night. At the time, I was suff ering from the flu, which seemed like a
symptom of my unhappy personal situation. Feeling miserable while holed up in my
tiny apartment, I heard a knock at the door. A friend whom I rarely saw stood there,
shielding himself from the rain. Presenting me with a book, he said:  ‚ÄúHere, Michael.
I think you should read this.‚Äù With that, he departed, leaving me with a copy of Baba
Ram Dass‚Äôs book, Be Here Now.3 Formerly Richard Alpert, a psychology professor at
Harvard, Ram Dass (along with colleague Timothy Leary) had been dismissed from
the university for turning students onto LSD. Traveling to India, where he found his
guru, Ram Dass discovered that various meditative and yogic practices could gener-
ate the non-attachment and non-duality associated with enlightenment‚Äîwithout
using drugs. Be Here Now was so influential because Ram Dass brilliantly explained
major aspects of Indian teachings in ways that could resonate with Western readers.
Years earlier, I had seen Be Here Now at a bookstore, but I had dismissed it as
w
pop psychology masquerading as Eastern religion. I had little patience for either,
especially Asian thought to which my way was barred by a regrettable ethnocen-
trism. That this very book would appear unbidden in the midst of a personal crisis
persuaded me to read it that very night. In the wee hours I experienced something
like kensho, the Zen term for an initial awakening.4 I realized with unprecedented
conviction that my life was misguided, even though by the standards of most peo-
ple, including academics, my life was successful. Gripped by fear, I had long tried to
protect myself in ways that provoked unnecessary suff ering in myself and in others.
Attempting to satisfy various cravings, I had sometimes acted in ways that did not
make me feel proud. Suddenly, S√∏ren Kierkegaard‚Äôs dictum, ‚ÄúThe specific quality
of despair is not knowing that one is desperate,‚Äù struck me like a thunderbolt. That
night, I resolved to become a Zen monk, thereby supposing that doing so would
somehow bring me happiness.
First, of course, I needed to learn how to meditate.  Asian traditions oft en speak
of the tyranny of the ‚Äúmonkey mind,‚Äù the relentless interior chatter that jumps from
one topic to the next. My everyday experience was filled by neurotic chatter. All the
time I was thinking that it was I who was thinking, even though perhaps it would
be better to say that the thoughts were having me!  Aft er many years of meditation
practice, I finally learned how to silence the interior voice upon command. In the
summer of 1979, I spent five weeks as a guest student at Green Gulch Farm (near
Muir Woods outside of San Francisco) and at Tassajara Zen Mountain Retreat Center,
both of which were run by the San Francisco Zen Center. Arising at 4 am to meditate
every day (except Sundays, when we could sleep in until 6!) was challenging, in part
by the emotional torment provoked by being apart from my girlfriend, whom I even-
tually married. Clearly, I had a lot of work ahead of me.
In February 1980, I took part in a seven-day sesshin at the London Zen Center.
This was very serious business. Run by a well-known Rinzai Zen monk from Kyoto,
the sesshin required us to sit cross-legged for 40 minutes, sixteen times per day. Each
day was divided into four sessions of four 40-minute sittings. During the evening of
the third day, pain in my left  knee had become so overwhelming that I was exhaust-
ed. There was no way out, of course, because if you move your body in a Zen
y
sesshin,
you might as well go home. Having held the pain at arm‚Äôs length for as long as
534
SPEAKING BEING
possible, I finally surrendered to it. My expectation was that I would be obliterated,
leaving a smoking pile of rubble on the zafu (meditation cushion). Amazingly, how-
ever, the pain vanished, and was replaced by very intense sensations that had no
pain valence, so long as I did not introduce any temporal distinctions, such as ‚ÄúThis
has lasted so long. . . ‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow many more minutes. . . .‚Äù Upon introducing such dis-
tinctions, the excruciating pain would return, only to abate when I dove ever more
deeply into it, embracing and experiencing each subtle and not so subtle aspect of
it.  This was an astonishing discovery, which encouraged me to explore knee pain far
earlier during a later ten-day meditation retreat in Barre, Massachusetts. By letting
the sensations show up just as they occurred instant-by-instant, without telling a
story about them or representing them in some other way, they showed up as they
were rather than as how I had been representing them. By going ever more deeply
into the source of pain, I eventually experienced the disappearance of self and even
space/time, leaving nothing at all, which I later interpreted as what Heidegger called
the ‚Äúclearing,‚Äù the no-thingness that allows all contents of awareness to reveal
themselves. Those contents can include the multiple stories we make up about
what shows up, but I discovered the diff erence between the sheer showing up
(Being) of contents, on the one hand, and my representations/stories about them,
on the other.
During the Zen sesshin, each of us had a nightly meeting with the Zen master,
a remarkable human being. I was typically a basket case when climbing the stairs
to his room, where he sat cross-legged. Usually, he just looked at me for a few
moments‚Äîwithout saying a word‚Äîbefore ringing the dismissal bell. I hoped that
the smile on his face was benevolent! Whatever shreds of self-assurance I may have
had before climbing the steps‚Äî‚ÄúAft er all, a man is justified in being tired aft er such
rigorous meditation!‚Äù‚Äîwere removed by his penetrating gaze. I had a long way to
go before I could ever be like him. Nevertheless, his extraordinary mode of Being
showed me what is possible for a human being. I didn‚Äôt have to be this neurotic,
self-absorbed, worried person.
In December 1981, I took the est Training in a suburb of New Orleans. Given
t
the previous course of my life, which included writing about Heidegger‚Äôs concept
of authentic existence, practicing Zen meditation and hatha yoga, reading widely in
Eastern and Western spiritual traditions, and above all still wallowing in ignorance,
I was a prime candidate for what the Training had to off er. It allowed for the pos-
sibility of seeing that one‚Äôs ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù is deeply tied up with one‚Äôs ‚Äúracket,‚Äù the
particular way in which one defends one‚Äôs identity by making oneself right and/or
others wrong, or more generally, constantly justifying oneself. To experience being
free from my racket, I first had to become aware of its structure (that is, the ‚Äúpayoff s‚Äù
and the gratification that seems to come from the payoff s of my racket, and on the
other hand the ‚Äúcost‚Äù of my rackets to the quality of my life), and second I had to
identify with it, to embrace it (make it my own). Paradoxically, this move was a nec-
essary condition for the next step, distinguishing myself from my racket. In doing so,
a palpable sense of freedom spontaneously arose. What had been my subjectivity,
my racket, now became a mere object in a wider awareness.
As the Training progressed, I began to conclude that this wider awareness is an
instance of what Heidegger had in mind by the ‚Äúclearing,‚Äù the openness that consti-
tutes human existence. For Heidegger, authentic human existing means letting this
clearing disclose entities as they are, rather than as how they show up through one‚Äôs
projections, stories, and self-justifying assertions. At one point, in reply to the Train-
er‚Äôs query about what we were beginning to realize, I raised my hand to say: ‚ÄúWho
we really are is no-thing! We are not things, not identities, not personalities, not
emotions‚Äîwe are the clearing in which all these can arise.‚Äù Even the distinction that
we are no-thing, so I came to realize, arises within the clearing. As Heidegger would
put it, we don‚Äôt own the clearing; instead, the clearing ‚Äúowns‚Äù us so that things can
show up and thus ‚Äúbe.‚Äù I would later discover that while I was in that 1981 est Train-
ing, Werner Erhard was exploring some of the ways in which Heidegger‚Äôs thought
overlapped with and could grant greater force to the ideas embodied in the Training.
Not long ago, when I was conversing with Erhard, he referred to this famous
phrase from Heidegger‚Äôs essay ‚ÄúWhat Is Metaphysics?‚Äù (1929): We are ‚Äúheld out
into the nothing.‚Äù5 Erhard maintains that The Forum is designed to allow for this
experience, to be held out into the nothing, that is, into the emptiness and mean-
inglessness of existence. Without first-person experience of this emptiness, people
continue to cling to the subjective narratives that give rise to their rackets, as well as
other automatic instances of inauthenticity. Having become aware of their rackets
and their narrative-based identities, participants can notice the clearing‚Äîunder-
stood not only as the open space needed for things to show up and thus ‚Äúto be,‚Äù but
also as the opening for a possible future in which things might be other than what
r
would otherwise be predictable; indeed, a possible future in which people at times
might make choices not dictated by their rackets. The
t
experience of being held out
into the nothing, into meaninglessness, is necessary for disclosing the ontological
event called the clearing.
In our conversation, Erhard aff irmed that his profound encounter with the empti-
ness and meaninglessness of his own identity did not lead‚Äîcontrary to expectation‚Äî
to moral irresponsibility and nihilism. In fact, prior to that encounter, he had acted
Aft erword
535
irresponsibly in ways that occasioned considerable suff ering on the part of others,
including members of his own family. He reported that by wiping away the signifi-
cance of his story, he was left  only with the ontological clearing. At this moment, what
l
showed up was the mess that he had created, but without any story about it, as well
as the authentic obligation to clean things up. Erhard told me that in cleaning things
up with his family, he told them he was not apologizing to them, because that would
somehow soft en the raw fact of what he had done. So long as he was his story, his
self-justifying interior narrative, the suff ering he had provoked remained blunted. He
could not let others be who they were; instead, they were reduced to pawns in his own
game. Unthinking identification with his story stood in the way of allowing others to
be beyond the limits imposed by their own narratives. This recognition contributed to
his decision to initiate the est Training.
t
What it means to share in the est Training
and The Forum
Most of the activity in the Training involved sharing by participants. Trainers (later,
Forum leaders) were there to help participants recognize their rackets, their ways
of manipulating self and others for ends that are oft en not understood. As Hyde
and Kopp have demonstrated so well in their book, the inter-subjective component
was crucial to the success of The Forum, as it was for the est Training. The centrality
t
of sharing in the Training helps to explain why it could take people so far so fast,
when compared to other avenues to transformation. Over the course of many hours,
participants listen to each other describe a similar mode of Being-in-the-world:
operating so as to promote survival oft en at the expense of others and their own
quality of life. It is easier to recognize these inauthentic ways of being in others, but
having done so leaves me with the possibility of seeing them in myself. The Training
and later The Forum (and The Landmark Forum) allowed over two million people
to reliably experience liberation from their rackets, from the compulsion to be right
(oft en at the expense of others) and from the need to constantly self-justify.
In the Training that I took‚Äîand as in the 1989 Forum recounted in this book‚Äî
the dialogue opened up, and soon revealed that the participants were frustrated,
suff ering, confused, and hiding their pettiness, all because of what the Forum leader
called their ‚Äúrackets.‚Äù At first most people scoff ed at the idea that they were running
y
(or were run by) a racket. Instead, they were amazed at the ridiculous things that
other apparently accomplished people were saying about conducting their lives.
Gradually, however, the courage exhibited by certain participants in their honest
sharing shift ed the mood in the room to one of utmost seriousness regarding what
was being disclosed. Increasingly, we began to support one another in the sharing
process. We came to recognize that, perhaps for the first time, we were speaking
frankly with others about what really matters in life, and about the obstacles that we
had placed in the path of living aligned with what really matters.
I recall one particular moment when I experienced this for myself. It was on
the Saturday aft ernoon of the second weekend of the Training that I took in 1981,
when participants were asked to take part in a ‚Äúmilling‚Äù exercise (which is not found
in The Forum or The Landmark Forum). The ballroom had been cleared of chairs.
In the large open space, we were asked to walk slowly around, making eye contact
with others, but not engaging in conversation. We were simply to witness each oth-
er. By this point, many of us had already shared our stories. Otherwise successful,
educated, and capable people had started to ‚Äúcome clean‚Äù about their rackets. We
were in touch with the vast pain, heartache, sorrow, and frustration brought about
by our treachery, lying, cowardice, and perhaps above all self-deception. Even as I
write about this, I am brought back into that extraordinary moment, when waves
of compassion began arising within me. I had never experienced anything like it.
Finally understanding the mechanical, unavoidable aspect of so much human be-
havior, I also began to forgive others, and myself. We are thrown into a very diff icult
situation, we self-conscious human beings. Doing our best to survive and prosper,
we sometimes act in ways that later haunt us.
The courageous sharing that occurred in the Training allowed me and others
to see the truth of the Hindu saying, Tat tvam asi, ‚ÄúThat thou art.‚Äù The poor devil
breaking down across the room, the other person who had made such a mess of her
life even while being so ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù‚Äînow I could see that person is me, just running
a diff erent racket! One by one, people began to realize that we are all in this togeth-
er. Run by fear, we employ survival strategies, oft en developed before we became
self-conscious. By the time we are adults, we are deeply patterned to act in ways that
protect us and that justify us, such that everything we do is ‚Äúin order to‚Äù promote
our self-defending project, whereas we experience little if anything in and for itself.
People want to act nobly, generously, courageously, and honestly, but doing so is dif-
t
ficult and rare, which is why we admire people on those occasions when they can act
in such ways. Seeing how compulsive the actions of other people are, participants
gain insight into how circumscribed their own lives are as a result of fear and anxiety,
and see that furthermore, no amount of achievement, success, sex, drugs, and rock
and roll will ‚Äúfix me.‚Äù It is sometimes said that people are above all committed to
‚ÄúBeing right and looking good,‚Äù but in the Training invidious distinctions between
536
SPEAKING BEING
self and other melted away, without any sense of boundary violation. There arose a
higher level of ‚Äúwe-ness‚Äù that respected diff erence, but that no longer allowed diff er-
ence to create an insuperable barrier to being together in the world.
The Forum hammers home the idea that there is no way to escape the racket
that constitutes one‚Äôs basic way of Being-in-the-world, and that people do what
they do because they have little freedom in the matter. However, perhaps the great-
est realization generated in The Forum, as in the Training, is that despite all this,
people are more than their rackets, more than their fear-driven habitual stances and
practices. Rather, we are the clearing for possibility, as Erhard suggests in the tran-
script of the 1989 Forum. What makes the clearing for possibility available is what
Erhard calls ‚Äúbeing authentic about one‚Äôs inauthenticity,‚Äù where we own up to‚Äîtake
responsibility for‚Äîthe fact that we compulsively ‚Äúrun rackets.‚Äù Such resolute em-
brace of my own inauthenticity unexpectedly allows for a taste of freedom, in which
a new possibility for action can show up. Such action is motivated not ‚Äúin order to‚Äù
improve my standing, but instead arises solely for the sake of handling what a given
situation calls for, as an end in itself.
During the 1970s and 1980s, some critics charged the Training with promot-
ing narcissism, as in the ‚ÄúMe Generation,‚Äù and encouraging successful selfishness.
Although the actions of some Training graduates may have encouraged such critical
evaluations, the Training itself revealed step by step that self-absorption‚Äîespecially
clinging to my ‚Äúviews‚Äù about this or that‚Äîis the source of suff ering in my life and in
the lives of others. Insight into our shared openness, the marvelous freedom with
d
which we are mysteriously endowed, generates not selfishness but rather compas-
sion and the question: ‚ÄúHow can I help?‚Äù One of Erhard‚Äôs favorite phrases goes like
this: ‚ÄúIf you forget who you really are, then be of service.‚Äù Erhard‚Äôs oft en-stated goal
of creating a world that works for everyone stems from a deep realization that life
is not just about me, it‚Äôs about everyone. Like many of those who took the Training
and later The Forum, I would not trade the insight it provided for anything in the
world. No amount of money, fame, power, sex, drugs, or knowledge is comparable
to what one spiritual tradition calls the ‚Äúthe pearl of great price.‚Äù
Spirituality and its relationship to the
est Training and The Forum
Those who are interested in spirituality and philosophy of religion, as I am,
can find parallels between Zen Buddhism, Hinduism, and Christianity, on the
one hand, and the Training, on the other. The Training and The Forum are best
understood, however, as ontological rather than ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù explorations. Unlike
traditional spirituality, as typically experienced in church, synagogue, or mosque,
and in other non-religious spiritual disciplines, the Training sought to disclose the
ontological structure of human existence.
Erhard would agree that theologians can draw upon this ontological insight, as
twentieth-century German theologian Rudolf Bultmann drew upon Heidegger‚Äôs phi-
losophy so as to ‚Äúdemythologize‚Äù Christian theology. Theology, however, interprets
the transformational experience in accordance with religious concepts and narra-
tives, some of which conflict with the Training‚Äôs claim that everything is inherently
‚Äúempty and meaningless,‚Äù until we assign a meaning to something that occurs.6 For
Biblical theism, the universe was meaningful long before humans showed up, be-
cause God intentionally created it. Although informed by an evidence-based idea of
human existence, the Trainers engaged in phenomenology, that is, instead of getting
bogged down in discussion of the merits of this theory versus another one, Trainers
focused on what actually discloses itself in the processes of sharing and interpret-
ing that sharing. As the transcript of the 1989 Forum reveals, the number of shares
supporting The Forum‚Äôs basic assumptions‚Äîthat we are the clearing in which things
can show up and thus ‚Äúbe,‚Äù and that we assign meanings to events that do not
inherently contain such meaning‚Äîwas overwhelming.7
In the 1989 Forum, Erhard engages briefly in God-talk, but primarily to dissuade
people from using the idea of God to further their rackets. Doing so, he says at one
point, amounts to blasphemy. ‚ÄúBlasphemy‚Äù may seem to be a curious term to use in
a secular, ontological inquiry. Here is one way to make sense of that usage. The God-
talk in the 1989 Forum is an instance of what Buddhists calls skillful means (upaya).
Mahayana Buddhism, especially Zen, maintains that ‚Äúsalvation‚Äù does not lie in some
far-off  realm still to come, but instead is always already available here and now, in
this very human body/mind. Depicting God as some sort of super entity controlling
everything from up in heaven, while apart from human existence, impedes discovery
of humankind‚Äôs own mode of Being and the possibilities belonging to it. This is the
point made by the shocking Mahayana Buddhist directive: ‚ÄúIf you encounter the Bud-
dha on the road, kill him!‚Äù You can‚Äôt kill the Buddha, however, because he‚Äôs not ‚Äúout
there.‚Äù Instead, Buddha-nature lies within each human being, awaiting the possibility
of awakening to itself.8 Toward the end of The Forum, there typically arises what I
call ‚Äúthe space of transformation,‚Äù that extraordinary moment when most partici-
pants had the experience of shedding the burden of their rackets. Yes, the rackets will
return, but for many people, never with the force that the rackets once had.
Critics sometimes charge that Erhard‚Äôs seminars lack ‚Äúspirituality,‚Äù but most
participants in the 1989 Forum experienced with joy the realization that they are not
Aft erword 537
substances with certain properties, but instead the clearing that is open to possibil-
ity. What The Forum refuses to provide, and in fact cannot provide based on its own
method of exploration, is some story about the ultimate ‚Äúmeaning of life.‚Äù The three
y
Western monotheisms provide such stories, which have inspired faith for many cen-
turies. Instead of off ering such a story, however, The Forum leaves to participants
the task of establishing goals and organizing their lives to achieve them. The issue of
an otherworldly, metaphysical eschaton does not come up, except when it is brought
up by participants, and then The Forum leader typically brings the conversation
back to the here and now, to what‚Äôs right in front of the participant. And yet, accord-
ing to Erhard, most clergy, be they priest, nun, rabbi, minister, or imam, have left  the
est Training or The Forum with a deeper relation to their particular practice of faith.
t
Deflecting and dismissing ‚Äúmetaphysical‚Äù concerns is a common practice
among Zen masters. Having been knocked off  a bridge into the water below by a
Zen master exasperated by his student‚Äôs persistent metaphysical questioning, for
example, one Zen student finally ‚Äúawakened.‚Äù The key was finally realizing the futil-
ity of such questioning and the opportunity of existing fully in this life, moment by
moment. Another anecdote reveals the inveterate tendency to ‚Äúgo metaphysical,‚Äù
as well as the opportunity to follow a diff erent path. A famous Zen koan says: ‚ÄúShow
me your original face before you were born!‚Äù I used to think that the answer to this
koan had something to do with revealing who I was in the bardo, the realm in which
one‚Äôs ‚Äúhabit-energy‚Äù dwells before manifesting itself in a new body-mind.  This is
‚Äúgoing metaphysical‚Äù in a way suggested by some Buddhist discourse. Only recently
did I arrive at a very diff erent interpretation of the koan, one consistent with what I
learned in the Training and later in The Forum. The key is what word to stress in the
koan: ‚ÄúShow me your original face before YOU were born!‚Äù By ‚Äúyou,‚Äù the koan has
in mind the fear-driven, greedy, delusional being that I had turned myself into. I did
not show up in the world like that, but gave birth to that unhappy self by decisions I
made while growing up. Not long ago, when I asked Werner Erhard if he agreed with
this interpretation of the koan, he said ‚ÄúYes! That‚Äôs it!‚Äù
Erhard, Heidegger, and The Forum
Around the time I took the Training, I had been reading psychiatrist Irvin D. Yalom‚Äôs
Existential Therapy, which argued that much human suff ering arose from not allow-
ing anxiety and ontological guilt to play the revelatory and transformative role they
could play in human existence.9 Citing authors such as Ernst Becker, author of The
Denial of Death, Yalom remarked that we shrink from life, we hide ourselves away, in
order to avoid paying the debt: death.10 Finitude is essential to authentic existence.
Staying in touch with mortality encourages us to be present each moment, rather
than fleeing into the myriad distractions now available.
I wrote to Yalom to see if I could study with him during a six-month sabbatical,
which I planned to spend in the Bay Area in the first half of 1982. He suggested that I
would benefit more by studying and teaching at the California School of Profession-
al Psychology in Berkeley. (The work I did there led to my subsequent appointment
as a clinical professor in the Psychiatry Department at Tulane University School of
Medicine.) Shortly aft er arriving in Berkeley in early January, Hubert Dreyfus invited
me to his house for dinner. Dreyfus was a leading interpreter of Heidegger‚Äôs philos-
ophy and later was professor emeritus for many years at the University of California
at Berkeley. Soon, I discovered that he, too, had done the Training, that he had been
blown away by it, that he knew Werner Erhard, and that he was co-director of the
PhD dissertation of Fernando Flores, who combined elements of speech act theory,
which he learned from Berkeley philosopher John Searle, with Heidegger‚Äôs view of
temporal-historical human existence, to develop a powerful vision of ‚Äúconversation
for action‚Äù in the ‚Äúoff ice of the future.‚Äù Erhard, a brilliant man in his own right, quick-
ly came to appreciate the role played by language in creating futures where none
seemed possible. This is a story for another time, however.11
Even before meeting Flores and learning something about Heidegger‚Äôs thought,
Erhard and colleagues had been planning to redesign the Training. Erhard invited
Dreyfus and me to develop philosophical critiques of the Training. We gladly con-
sented to do so, because both of us had gained so much from it. Each of us sat in on
Trainings given at diff erent times and locations, then composed our assessments
of what we witnessed.12 In May 1982 I met with Erhard, Flores, and several of their
colleagues to discuss my findings. The papers that Dreyfus and I wrote contributed
to what would become The Forum, the first version of which was presented in San
Francisco in 1985. It was a pleasure to attend that signal event. I am proud and hap-
py to have made a contribution to the emergence of The Forum.
Not long ago, I re-read the 104-page transcript of the discussion about my
critique of the Training. Doing so confirmed for me that Erhard had already come
up with the key elements of the Training, later The Forum, independently of what
y
he learned about Heidegger from Flores, Dreyfus, me, and others. Heidegger‚Äôs ideas
were remarkably similar to Erhard‚Äôs in many ways, and Erhard learned some valu-
able distinctions from Heidegger, but they arrived at their major ideas on their own.
Heidegger‚Äôs writings have had an enormous influence on twentieth-century
philosophy in Europe, Latin America, and to a lesser extent in the United States.
Perhaps his university teaching helped to evoke transformation experiences on the
538
SPEAKING BEING
part of some students, but he created no seminars with that aim in mind. Erhard‚Äôs
work, in contrast, has been made available to more than two million people by way
of the Training and later The Forum. Linguistic distinctions developed by Erhard and
colleagues have had a vast if underappreciated influence on culture in the past forty
years. Many distinctions that Erhard coined or used in new contexts have found their
way into the larger culture without being attributed to Erhard. The present book is in
part an eff ort to correct this situation.
Another diff erence between Erhard and Heidegger concerns compassion and
forgiveness. Those familiar with Heidegger know that such ideas rarely appear in his
early writings. In fact, his writings in the 1930s oft en emphasize steely resolution,
authentic being-towards-death, and a kind of ruthless commitment to revolutionary
change. Such discourse became particularly frequent and charged in the years when
Heidegger was involved with National Socialism, beginning in 1932. Later on, Heide-
gger developed his famous discourse on Gelassenheit, or ‚Äúreleasement,‚Äù the attitude
of letting things be, which some have read as including compassion for others.
Let me now answer the question that I posed at the beginning of this first
section of this Aft erword, namely, ‚ÄúDo the remarkable parallels between the work
of Erhard and Heidegger confirm the validity of their respective findings?‚Äù The fact
that Heidegger and Erhard arrived independently at similar findings about human
existence justifies taking the two views more seriously than either one alone. The
remarkable confluence of their findings does not, of course, mean that they are
true, such that other possible approaches to understanding human existence are
excluded. Indeed, there are many alternatives, which are oft en incompatible with
one another. As any student of Heidegger‚Äôs work knows, it exhibits unusual depth
and originality; likewise, the distinctions that Erhard deployed in the Training and
The Forum have elicited from many thousands of people an experience of the
clearing that is central to Heidegger‚Äôs thinking. I hope that the book that Hyde and
Kopp have written will be the first of many other investigations into the ontology of
human existence and into how we can elicit experiential insight into that ontology.
The question concerning Heidegger‚Äôs
Politics
Let me now pose a second and final question: Do revelations about Heidegger‚Äôs
d
far-right-wing political views negate the value of all his work and disqualify him as a
philosopher?
Martin Heidegger settled on a philosophical career only aft er health concerns
required him to end his Jesuit novitiate. He remained drawn to the mysticism of
Meister Eckhart, avidly read the works of Luther, and was influenced by Gnosticism.
In Being and Time Heidegger drew on such sources, and many others, in describing
humankind as ‚Äúthrown‚Äù and ‚Äúfallen,‚Äù fleeing from finite openness and from the
concrete possibilities disclosed therein, embracing instead routinized everyday
practices, and being seduced by countless distractions aimed at concealing who we
really are. This book revolutionized twentieth-century European philosophy, and
Heidegger had a dramatic eff ect on students, many of whom were Jews, such as
Hannah Arendt, Herbert Marcuse, Helena Weiss, Hans Jonas, and Karl L√∂with.
These students were understandably shocked when in 1933 Heidegger publicly
announced his allegiance to National Socialism. Caught up in the ecstatic revo-
lutionary moment, Heidegger used his own discourse of resolute authenticity to
encourage others to join him in supporting Adolph Hitler. For a few years Heidegger
was a devoted follower, but gradually became disenchanted with what one might
call the ‚Äúreally existing‚Äù Nazi party, which he came to regard as another version
of the same techno-industrial nihilism that in his perspective animated American
capitalism and Soviet Marxism. Nevertheless, he remained attached to the idea
that National Socialism had contained an ‚Äúinner truth and greatness‚Äù that had
been perverted by leaders who were not up to the task. Showing little sympathy for
Heidegger‚Äôs attempted self-justification, however, the Allies in charge of post-war
de-Nazification hearings concluded that his complicity with the Nazi regime made
him unfit for teaching. He was removed from his post at the University of Freiburg.
Ever since then, controversy has raged about the extent to which the positive con-
tributions of Heidegger‚Äôs thought can be separated from his far-right-wing, arguably
anti-Semitic views.
I had always been concerned about his Nazi aff iliation, so much so that my first
published article bears the title ‚ÄúHeidegger, Ethics, and National Socialism.‚Äù13 At that
time, I tended to side with his supporters, who contended that one should distin-
guish between Heidegger the thinker and Heidegger the man, that is, the misguided
political activist. Critics, on the other hand, charged that his philosophy had much
in common with Nazi ideology. In the late 1980s publication of books demonstrating
the aff inity between important aspects of Heidegger‚Äôs thought and Nazi ideology led
me to rethink my attitude toward his philosophy, as I reported in my book, Heideg-
ger‚Äôs Confrontation with Modernity: Technology, Politics, Art. 14
In that book, I argued that Heidegger‚Äôs notion of the ‚Äúhistory of being‚Äù had
much in common with views promoted by various Nazi ideologues and pro-Nazi phi-
losophers. According to Heidegger, modernity is the final stage in the long decline of
Aft erword 539
Western civilization from its grand beginning in ancient Greece. Techno-industrial
modernity brings to a culmination the nihilistic history of the West. It is worth
noting, as Berkeley philosopher Hans Sluga has pointed out, that Heidegger was
only one of many German philosophers who became either outright Nazis or else
fellow travellers.15 Many academic humanists of the era‚ÄîGerman, French, English,
Spanish, Italian‚Äîagreed with Heidegger that modernity was a colossal misstep,
which promoted the revolt of the masses. Of course, Heidegger‚Äôs already elevated
philosophical status meant that his conversion had greater significance at a time
when the Nazi regime still sought cultural legitimation. It is also worth noting that
much of what he says about techno-industrial modernity, namely, that it reduces
nature to mere raw material and humankind to resources demanded by the pow-
er-seeking system, is remarkably similar to what was said around the same time by
leading members of the left -wing Frankfurt School, including Theodor Adorno and
Max Horkheimer.
Heidegger‚Äôs view of Western history as leading to nihilism stands in stark
contrast to progressive interpretations, initiated by French Enlightenment thinkers,
as well as by G.W.F. Hegel, Marx, and many other nineteenth- and twentieth-century
European and American political theorists, according to which history leads to
emancipation from ignorance and unjust political authority, and to scientific knowl-
edge that promises relief from human misery. Heidegger‚Äôs anti-modernist attitudes
were similar in some ways to those held by Nietzsche. Both thinkers became major
influences on post-modern theory, which depicts modernity in ways that at times
have much in common with anti-modernist views that prevailed in Germany in the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
Despite his rejection of modernity and his embrace of the far-right Nazi par-
ty, Heidegger carefully avoided anti-Semitic statements in his published works.
Subsequent historical research has showed, however, that while he was Rektor of
the University of Freiburg (1933‚Äì34), he made such statements in off icial letters and
engaged in some anti-Jewish activity.
The ongoing publication of the Black Notebooks, which Heidegger began to
compose in the 1930s, brings the political controversy to a new stage. In these Note-
books, now appearing in his Gesamtausgabe (Collected Works), Heidegger writes that
European Jewry played a significant role in the rise of ‚Äúcalculative‚Äù thinking, which
he held responsible for modernity‚Äôs disclosure of everything as mere means for en-
hancing power. At times, he suggested that the Jews were somehow responsible for
the rise of such thinking, but at other times he indicated that the Jews were pawns
in the process by which the Being of entities had concealed itself, with the result that
entities (including humans) had been gradually reduced to sheer
instrumentality.
For Heidegger, human existence opens up the clearing in which entities can
manifest themselves and in this sense ‚Äúbe.‚Äù Supposedly, the ancient Greeks were
opened up in a way that allowed entities to stand forth, to reveal themselves in
ways that gave rise to incomparable beauty and terrible violence. Gradually, how-
ever, the clearing that constitutes human existence began to become constricted,
beginning already with Plato and Aristotle (!). Hence, the Being of entities could re-
veal itself in ever more limited ways. Instead of existing so as to let entities be man-
ifest in their own ways, humankind asserted itself as the human subject, arrogating
to itself the right to dominate the planet. Such violent self-assertion, according to
Heidegger, results not from a merely human decision, but instead from eff acement
of the Being of entities. In addition to blaming the Jews for this outcome, he also
assigns responsibility for it to the Catholic Church, American capitalism, Soviet
Marxism, scientism, democracy, and other institutions. In some ways, Heidegger
was an equal-opportunity denouncer.
Heidegger goes so far as to suggest that the death camps, however terrible their
outcome was for Jews, were the products of the very same calculative, instrumen-
tal, power-driven thinking that they had promulgated. Today, we would call this
‚Äúblaming the victims.‚Äù That he held such a view helps to explain, at last, his silence
about the Holocaust. We may be charitable in saying that he did not endorse the
death camps, but he did not speak out against them, even aft er the war, much to the
consternation of his Jewish students as well as many other philosophers who had
learned from Heidegger‚Äôs publications.
Anti-Semitism was widespread in Europe and America in the decades leading
up to World War II. It became particularly ferocious in Germany for many diff erent
reasons, one of them being that emancipated Jews turned out to be exceptionally
intelligent, capable, and hard-working, thereby winning positions of influence in
academia, medicine, law, and business. These achievements, presumably unexpect-
ed by a German population still harboring anti-Semitic views, provoked widespread
ressentiment, as Nietzsche put it. Germany‚Äôs defeat in World War I, accusations of
internal betrayal that led to that outcome, the punitive treaty at Versailles, the Great
Inflation followed by Great Depression, widespread street fighting between Nazi
Brownshirts and communists, and the perceived political gridlock arising from the
democratic Weimar regime, helped to create the conditions that allowed for a char-
ismatic demagogue like Hitler to seize power by blaming Jews for Germany‚Äôs misery.
Describing these social, political, and economic conditions, however, does not
540
SPEAKING BEING
remove personal responsibility for Heidegger and others who chose to side with the
Nazis and who tolerated the violence they wreaked on millions of innocent people.
There has already been a virtual tidal wave of commentary addressing the
question  of Heidegger‚Äôs anti-Semitism,  most recently as it appears in his Black
Notebooks.16  Some scholars conclude that Heidegger‚Äôs should no longer be
taught or studied, because it is allegedly ‚Äúcontaminated‚Äù with far-right-wing and
anti-Semitic views. My own view is that Heidegger‚Äôs philosophical gift s were so great
that we would make a mistake to boot him out of the philosophical cannon, any
more than we should exclude Wagner from the musical canon, even though his
anti-Semitic attitudes may be discerned on occasion in some of his greatest operas,
not to mention in his published essays. In both cases, we must read and listen with
discernment, with recognition that even brilliant philosophical work and stirring
musical compositions may contain dark and dangerous aspects.
Publication of the Black Notebooks ought to be an occasion for reflection about
the anti-Semitic and racist views that characterized much of the Western world, es-
pecially in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Recent work on American slavery
has demonstrated that this dreadful industrial regime provided the wealth needed
for capitalism to get up a head of steam by the middle of the nineteenth century.17
American and European colonialism, justified by white supremacist notions of ‚Äúthe
white man‚Äôs burdens,‚Äù included practices that we should look back upon with hor-
ror. Heidegger belonged to a version of that white supremacist world, even though
he adhered not to biological racism, but instead to a kind of metaphysical-linguistic
racism focused on the exceptionalism of the ancient Greeks and the German Volk.
Racist views, to be sure, were held by many, including those whom we otherwise
revere. The recent controversy over public display of the Confederate flag in some
Southern states demonstrates the cultural staying power of anti-modernism, includ-
ing white supremacy.
Heidegger should continue to be studied and appreciated for his important
philosophical contributions, especially work from the era of Being and Time, which
proves most important for understanding the parallels between Erhard‚Äôs work and
Heidegger‚Äôs. His later writings, including his powerful reflections on the nature of
language, and his eff ort to understand the essence of modern technology, also merit
attention, though they should be read while keeping in mind that they sometimes
entwined themselves with his far-right-wing political views.
One of the things that struck some of Heidegger‚Äôs students when reading Being
and Time was this: What should be the content of decisions made within the light of
t
resolute authenticity?  I am resolved, but resolved to do what? Heidegger answered
that question for himself in the early 1930s by becoming a Nazi. According to him,
only the situation itself makes clear what is called for. For him, then, authenticity
was consistent with being a Nazi, which for Heidegger also meant taking a stand
against Soviet Marxism, which he regarded as a mortal threat to Western civilization.
The inconceivable atrocities of the Holocaust seem to annul the validity of Heideg-
ger‚Äôs decision to support Nazism, even if his concern about Soviet Marxism may have
been justified. Throughout history, people have committed violence when they felt
duty-bound to fulfill some great task. There is no guarantee that anything we choose
to do now, even in moments of apparent clarity, will later prove morally praisewor-
thy.18 Heidegger joined a movement that provoked World War II and killed millions of
people in concentration camps. Presumably, readers of this book would agree that
at some point before he died, or even posthumously, Heidegger should have off ered
some expression of regret for his contributions to the Nazi movement. We can only
speculate about why he refused to do so, but one reason may be his inability to tell
the truth about his personal responsibility. Heidegger was a particular moral agent,
not the spokesperson for the ‚Äúhistory of Being.‚Äù
Although Erhard‚Äôs Forum is apolitical, it is not morally neutral. Those who took
The Forum in the late 1980s, or The Landmark Forum up until the present, will recall
its emphasis on making a diff erence by contributing to the community. When Erhard
initiated the Hunger Project in the 1970s, his goal was to demonstrate that we could
end the conversation that holds hunger to be inevitable. Instead, we can initiate a
new conversation, according to which hunger can be ended. Despite being criticized
in some circles, the Hunger Project was an important social, economic, and political
intervention. It invited people to commit to this proposition: We do not have to put
up with hunger. There is enough food, but we lack the conviction that hunger can
be eliminated. By changing our attitude toward hunger, we can end it, thus helping
to create a world that works for everyone. Or as Erhard would put it, by altering the
way hunger occurs for us as inevitable, so that it can occur for us as
r
endable, our
behavior related to hunger would also be altered.
Erhard would agree that life is dangerous. In taking a stand, we may end up
going astray, even though it made sense to take that stand at the moment. One
of the reasons that The Forum‚Äôs sharing is so important, however, is its revelation
that most people really want to make a diff erence that contributes to human well
being and‚Äîthese days‚Äîto planetary well being, too. Creating and attempting to
bring to fruition possible and desirable futures‚Äîthese are risky endeavors. Not only
can they fail, and usually will fail, but at times they will cause more harm than they
attempted to prevent. Recognizing this is an invitation to heed what others have to
Aft erword 541
say, especially those who are most critical about what we propose to do. Heedless
confidence in your own way of being the one that will perfect the world, as was the
case in totalitarian movements of the twentieth century, is almost certainly a recipe
for disaster. New worlds must be built together with people from a wide variety of
perspectives, pre-modern, modern, and post-modern.
*********
In the foregoing book, Hyde and Kopp have threaded the needle. They have showed
that Heidegger‚Äôs work has important parallels with ideas that Erhard arrived at on
his own, and they have done so in a way that leaves no room for ascribing either
far-right-wing or far-left -wing views to Erhard. Although he may be an existentialist,
he is also a modernist, unlike Heidegger.  I regard Speaking Being as an enormous-
ly important contribution to understanding Heidegger and Erhard. The latter has
received far too little serious academic attention, and this book begins to make up
for that lack. Moreover, the book‚Äôs analysis of Heidegger‚Äôs thought is among the best
that I have ever read. I commend this book to all readers without reservation.

Shogun. Erhard has oft en acknowledged his debt to the Zen tradition. Heidegger was new
to him, but not to the Japanese, who have produced at least five translations of Heidegger‚Äôs
Being and Time, because they sense a connection between sunyata and what Heidegger had in
mind by nothingness (das Nichts) or the clearing that constitutes human existence.
