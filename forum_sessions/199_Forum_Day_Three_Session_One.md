Forum Day Three: Session One
185
KIPP (covering his head with a tissue; laughter)
This is what you‚Äôve been calling you.
XAVIER
I see the payoff s and the costs, but now what?
KIPP
Two more days, that‚Äôs what.
Xavier sat down looking considerably lighter than when he had stood up. Another participant, Edna,
stood next.
EDNA
When I came in here I had a bag of negatives with me.
KIPP
‚ÄúA bag of negatives‚Äù is a description.
EDNA
I didn‚Äôt want to be here. I have six children and grandchildren in this Forum. I thought we were
all going to do The Forum together. It didn‚Äôt take me long to realize that they were going to do
their Forum and I was going to do my Forum. I kept looking for where in the room my family
was. At one point, I saw my son walking toward the door. I feared for his and my looking good. I
realized how much looking good had been running my life. It‚Äôs not anymore.
KIPP
It is anymore. It is there. But you‚Äôve got some choice now in how it uses you.
(to the group)
What you‚Äôre listening to is a mother whose children became trophies.
ERHARD
Like all mothers: you lose yourself. You become your children. Let me tell you something: you
have very little to do with the way your children grow up. Look at yourself. You did it the way
you wanted to do it. But everyone has bullshit about ‚ÄúThey made me.‚Äù Kids like to eat. ‚ÄúIf you
want to eat in this house, do this and this and this. If you don‚Äôt want to eat, do something else.‚Äù
I told my son, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feed you because I love you. It‚Äôs against the law not to feed you.‚Äù You
lose yourself and become your children. The single most important thing you have to give your
children is your own well-being, and make sure they don‚Äôt get in the way. They may not use it
wisely, but your self is what you‚Äôve got to give them. The one thing I could never get away from
with my mother was who she was. But I forgot everything she told me.
EDNA
They didn‚Äôt know the reason for me wanting them to look good: so that I would look good.
AWAKENING ATTUNEMENTS
Werner Erhard has consistently denied that his work is
appropriately characterized by the term philosophy. But he
has issued this denial in a cultural context where philosophy is
generally regarded as a purely academic pursuit, in which one
studies the thinking of great thinkers in order to gain knowledge
and perhaps thereby to attain wisdom.
The people who direct this study are professors of philosophy,
but are rarely considered publicly to be themselves philosophers;
our culture has no clear or off icial requirements for that desig-
nation. The academic process generally entails learning about
philosophy, not doing philosophy. This is not necessarily the
aim of the professors, but arises from the constricting assump-
tions of the current paradigm that structures the processes of
acquiring knowledge within academic settings. Given this way of
understanding the term ‚Äúphilosophy,‚Äù it clearly does not describe
Erhard‚Äôs methodology.
But certainly, as Erhard has acknowledged, his work does
address many of the concerns of philosophy (‚ÄúThe Heart of the
Matter‚Äù), concerns that are likewise central in the work of Martin
Heidegger, who is considered as off icial a ‚Äúphilosopher‚Äù as anyone
from the twentieth century. In Germany during the prime of his
career, between 1920 and the 1960s, Heidegger was immersed
in a culture that revered both the academic system itself and in
particular the academic discipline of philosophy. In responding to
this opportunity, he rose to pre-eminence as an academic and as a
philosopher. (Please see Michael E. Zimmerman‚Äôs Aft erword to this

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
If you were going to design a universe you would not design growing up like people do it. But
that‚Äôs the way it is. It‚Äôs messy. The single most important issue between parents and children is
that they love each other. And that‚Äôs almost never the discussion. It doesn‚Äôt make you a better
person to clean your room. The point is to have a little straightness in the conversation. It‚Äôs a
diffi  cult process at best. There are no experts on raising children. No one has the code. It‚Äôs very
powerful what Edna is talking about. You‚Äôve got to keep getting off  it with your children too.
The interesting thing about kids: if you get off  it with them, they‚Äôll get off  it with you. When
you‚Äôre being straight with them, it occurs to them they might be straight with you. Great, Edna.
Good stuff , really good stuff .
(turning to the group)
Where‚Äôs Jane?
The young woman who had spoken the previous day (Day Two, Session Four) about her father and
stepmother stood.
ERHARD
What happened to sad?
JANE
I don‚Äôt know.
ERHARD
Do you really not know, or do you not want to talk about it?
JANE
I think I was sad because... it was all up here. I was scared so much.
ERHARD
What do you mean ‚ÄúI think‚Äù?
JANE
I know.
ERHARD
What you‚Äôre saying is ‚ÄúI was feeling emotional because I was standing up in front of a group of
people.‚Äù What happened that you feel that way? Don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù ever again.
JANE
Something that happened that I don‚Äôt remember.
ERHARD
Can you remember a time when you stood up in front of a group of people?
book to provide further context concerning questionable political
judgments of Heidegger the ‚Äúman,‚Äù which put at risk the substan-
tial innovations and contributions of Being and Time and of his
other writings.)
The contribution and innovation of Heidegger‚Äôs thinking that
is central to our study includes his particular path of thinking,
a path that reached beyond the academic context in which he
worked and thrived, and into the domain of ontology. Working
persistently in this domain for more than five decades, he strove to
honor the discipline of philosophy by committing his life to under-
mining its foundational concepts.
Embedded throughout his many published volumes is a per-
spective on philosophy, and its relation to language, that strongly
resonates with Werner Erhard‚Äôs approach to ontological inquiry.
In the lectures published as The Fundamental Concepts of Meta-
physics, for example, Heidegger is elusive regarding philosophy‚Äôs
nature. Philosophy is
‚Äú
not some mere gathering of knowledge that we
can easily obtain for ourselves any time from
books, but (we know this only obscurely) some-
thing to do with the whole, something extreme,
where an ultimate pronouncement and interlocu-
tion occurs on the part of human beings. (FCM 4,
M
emphasis added).
He is emphatic on one point: ‚ÄúPhilosophy is philosophizing. . . .
It itself is only whenever we are philosophizing.‚Äù Philosophy
emerges in acts of languaging; and if it is authentic philosophy, it
emerges newly in each iteration, ‚Äúhowever much we seem merely
to be repeating the same thing‚Äù (FCM 4). Frequently in The Forum,
Erhard calls out the participants whom he hears codifying their
experiences as beliefs. Authentic philosophy rips space open newly
in every articulation; it is philosophizing that never calcifies into
philosophy.
Further, Heidegger suggested the direction that philosophical
dialogue should move in the current epoch. The task concerns at-
tunements, which are ways of being open to the world. A human be-
ing is never just open; we are always open in some particular way.
