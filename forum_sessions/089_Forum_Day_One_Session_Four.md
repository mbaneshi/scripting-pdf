Forum Day One: Session Four

Lee Iacocca and Al Newheart’s books? They would give everything they’ve got if they could give
what they’ve got to you. Why can’t they?
(pointing to the right of the X on the chalkboard)
Because they write the book in this language, the language of description, definition, and expla-
nation. Because people don’t buy books they can’t understand. That’s why we took your money
before you got in here. When I talk about power I’m talking about something like the freedom
to be, not force, which is the negation of power. I saw a film of a Japanese Judo master, and
never once saw that man stop to think. And I watched the film over and over. The guys he was
fighting stopped to think and got thrown. He was acting out of being something. His opponents,
on the other hand, were acting out of knowing the answers. You see, you can’t throw somebody
unless they’re set some way.
(moving away from the board)
We’re going to talk about another critical thing: the listening that you are. I know you’ve got
questions and comments, and I know some of it didn’t go clunk for you yet. That’s all right.
We’ll get there. I talk in a language designed and crafted to give access to what concerns you at
its source. Now I want to talk about the already always listening that you are. What is the listen-
ing you already always are? For the moment, in this conversation, what you are is a listening.
In the normal course of events, I talk to you like you’re an empty vessel. That isn’t the way it is.
The vessel’s already full, up to the top. It only admits certain things and it expels other things. It
changes certain things. You and I are an already always listening.
(pausing)
When I got this distinction already always listening—not a concept or an idea, but a distinction;
I’m teasing you with that word and you’ll find out about it tomorrow—I began to look at what is
my already always listening. It was very clear to me. The already always listening I was, was “I
know.” I was even a bigger pain in the ass in those days, and a smartass to boot. The only thing I
ever heard was what I already knew. You wake up a certain listening. Your job on this break will
be to discover the listening which you already always are.
(pausing)
Who can see already what your listening is?
PARTICIPANT
The already always listening which I am is that I understand you completely.
ERHARD
Very good.
PARTICIPANT
I’m not good enough.
ERHARD
A lot of us share that one: “The listening I’m going to provide for you is ‘I’m not good enough.’”
Already Always Listening
This is a core distinction of The Forum, a hint that works together
with other distinctions (e.g., mood and concern) to relocate
participants’ understanding of the source of meaning in their
lives. It asks participants to consider that the way they hear (and
see) events and people in their lives is a function of their listening,
rather than being sourced by the people and events themselves.
It would be possible, of course, to engage in a similar
conversation using a more familiar psychological model. Such a
conversation would assert that one’s perceptions are shaped by
one’s attitudes. This way of framing things would be immediately
accessible to anyone whose understanding has been shaped by
th e Cartesian paradigm of an “internal” subject in an objectively
meaningful world.
But locating the source of meaning in one’s listening rather
than in one’s mind situates the process in the world rather than
“in the heads” of participants. This furthers the development of
the Heideggerian model of human being as Being-in-the-world.
Participants in Werner Erhard’s work are frequently coached
to “stay out of your head,” and to “get present.” In Erhard’s
vocabulary, “in your head” is equivalent to “in the past.” This is
where the nature of one’s already always listening is determined:
one makes decisions about people based on past events (“he’s
untrustworthy,” “she’s controlling,” “they never listen to me”), and
these decisions shape the way life occurs in the future.
Erhard has used the analogy of yellow sunglasses, worn for an
extended period of time: eventually, you forget that the sunglasses

SPEAKING BEING
PARTICIPANT
I’m going to figure out what you’re saying wrong.
ERHARD
There’s a lot of crap in school. I don’t want to put the school system down. I have a lot of
respect for teachers. But one of the things you find out in school is that you’re either smart or
dumb. However, there’s no such thing as dumb. I did some work in a school for the disabled.
One student, Jesse, was considered “uneducable.” It was decided, however, that he was educa-
ble enough to be sent to a school to learn to wash cars. On the day I was there, I was told that
Jesse had stuffed a teacher in a trash can. As a consequence, he got sent back to the home for
disabled students, where he could sit around, be friendly, and play. Stupid is a way to survive in
school. Stupid is an act, a racket.
PARTICIPANT
The already always listening that I am is “I don’t want to and you can’t make me.”
ERHARD
You want to get this. A lot of people listen through “life is hard.” A lot of people listen through
“life is a burden.” My dentist told me about his experience as a Boy Scout. No matter what the
scoutmaster had suggested—hiking, swimming, going home—the Scouts always had the same
response: “OH NOOOOOO!” You are this listening. That’s the clearing you are in which life
happens.
PARTICIPANT
Mine is “How can I use this?” “How can I get better?”
ERHARD
Almost everybody’s like that: “How can I use this?” Almost all the power in the world can’t be
used. People don’t use power. Power uses people.
PARTICIPANT
“What are you going to tell me new that I don’t already know?”
ERHARD
Great.
PARTICIPANT
My already always listening is “How can I help you? Do you like me now?”
ERHARD
Beautiful.
are the cause of the world’s yellowness. Like the sunglasses, one’s
way of listening remains invisible because it is always and already
determining one’s point of view, making the way a situation
appears become the way things are. The aim of this inquiry is
for participants to notice these already always ways of listening
in as much specificity as possible. The Forum proposes that the
fundamental elements of human listening are widely shared, even
across cultures; Erhard asserts that there is a “culture of human
being” that transcends national boundaries. All human beings,
for example, listen for positive assessments of themselves, and
for evidence that they are right in their beliefs about the world.
But individuals develop specific variations, and in this part of The
Forum dialogue participants are encouraged to discover their own.
In this way, the dialogue continues to turn participants toward
themselves in an intensely reflexive process. ■
