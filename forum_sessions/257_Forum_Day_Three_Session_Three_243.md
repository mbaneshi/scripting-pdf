Forum Day Three: Session Three 243
ERHARD
You do what you do, and coincidentally it sometimes matches the story you’ve got about what
you like to do. And what makes you stupid is to say, “When I’m good I do what I like to do and
when I’m bad I do what I don’t like to do.” No. When you’re bad you’re bad and when you’re
good you’re good. And don’t fuck it up with all that philosophical horseshit. That’s what he
means by fi reside chat. That’s your racket Jacob. I know you think that’s the way to be. I know
you think that’s the right way to be.
JACOB
No, it’s a way to be.
ERHARD
No, it’s not even a way to be. That’s just the way you are.
JACOB
And if I do it another way, it’ll be another way.
ERHARD
But you won’t do it another way. You’ll do it the way you do it. That conversation is
nonsensical. It gets you into trouble. Things are the way they are, and they are always not the
way they’re not. And what you do is say that you do it to make life interesting; and not because
that’s the right thing to say, but because that’s what you do.
JACOB
But the one thing that I can control is...
ERHARD
But here’s the thing. You’re not getting the point, Jacob. You’re too engaged in the
conversation. Listen to what’s not being said. There’s something to get out of the conversation
and I’m not going to say it and you’re not going to say it. It’s going to be unsaid. And that’s
what there is to get here. Otherwise you’re paying 625 dollars to pass on your philosophy to a
guy who couldn’t care less. You paid him to pass on your philosophy.
JACOB
I paid 625 dollars to hear your philosophy.
ERHARD
No, I don’t have any philosophy. All I have is dog shit.
JACOB
How about my philosophy through you?
ERHARD
That’s horseshit. I don’t like philosophies. That’s more nah nah nah nah nah. Philosophies.
Heidegger’s languaging here may occur as tortured or as
poppycock, unless we keep in mind the enigmatic nature of
hints, which always beckon us away from that toward which
they simultaneously point us; and of reflexive languaging, which
creates perplexities to liberate our thinking. Under the rubric of the
Same, Heidegger is distinguishing a way of listening for the world,
and he invites us to follow:
To think is surely a peculiar aff air. The word of
thinkers has no authority. The word of thinkers
knows no authors, in the sense of writers. The
word of thinking is not picturesque; it is with-
out charm. The word of thinking rests in the
sobering quality of what it says. Just the same,
thinking changes the world. It changes it in the
ever darker depths of a riddle, depths which
as they grow darker off er promise of a greater
brightness. (EGT 78)
“
We read in this passage an iteration of The Forum’s rhetorical
process, which takes participants down one level at a time to
confront the empty depths of the Nothing, before lighting the
opening that has thereby been unconcealed.

SPEAKING BEING
JACOB
Okay.
ERHARD
You’re up there and this is The Forum. It’s not like I picked you out. Why am I staying in this
conversation with you? The Forum is for you and I to engage in this until what you’re not
saying and what I’m not saying is there for you to hear. There’s something to hear that neither
of us is going to say. That’s the name of this game. It’s underneath all that wisdom you got. I’m
not denigrating your wisdom. Your wisdom’s pretty good. I like it. And if we were out having a
drink I would listen to it and discuss it. I would. I like that stuff  too. But that’s not The Forum.
The Forum is to get what’s underneath that. And what there is to get here is that it’s empty and
meaningless. Now you’re a pretty sharp guy and you got some of that. But now you’re going to
turn that into a philosophy. Don’t do that. Just get it. It’s empty and meaningless, and it’s empty
and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless. And life is not going to turn out.
JACOB
It’s the part that it is empty and meaningless that gets me, because that has a little bit of
meaning to it.
ERHARD
No. It has no meaning to it. That’s why I said it is empty and meaningless that it is empty and...
JACOB
I guess it was because I was thinking “because.”
ERHARD
Beautiful. Exactly. You got it. You can’t get “because” in there at all. Zero. If you add “because,”
you’re above zero. At zero it’s just empty and meaningless and it’s empty and meaningless that
it’s empty and meaningless. It’s not your life that’s empty and meaningless. It’s a rainstorm. Life
is empty and meaningless and you showed up in that, and got wet in it. It’s not your particular
little crappy life that’s empty and meaningless. It’s that life is empty and meaningless. That’s
what we showed up in.
Erhard stood close to Jacob and spoke intimately.
ERHARD
Jacob, you want to listen up here. Some people I don’t identify with. I can get them because I’m
trained to get them. I can identify with you. And you’re sharp enough to fuck yourself. I know
you can do it because I did it. I got the answers very early, and I developed them really well, but
I got them as answers.
JACOB
Yes, I’ve got this bucket of answers I carry around with me.
The Forum is for you and I to engage in this
until what you’re not saying and what I’m not
saying is there for you to hear. There’s some-
thing to hear that neither of us is going to say.
That’s the name of this game.
