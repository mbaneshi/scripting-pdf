SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
So what’s incomplete there?
JANE
I don’t know. I have a relationship with her. But I don’t know what’s incomplete.
ERHARD
How old were you when she became your mother?
JANE
Four, or fi ve, or six.
ERHARD
Did you lose something back there?
JANE
Back when I was a kid?
ERHARD
Yeah.
JANE
Maybe I lost some respect for my dad.
ERHARD
I’m going to tell you a story and I want you to look inside the story and see what’s there for you. 
Children have a bond of belonging and sometimes that gets broken. There’s this bond between
your parents and you, and then it gets broken. Did that happen for you?
JANE
I don’t think so.
ERHARD
Did it happen back then?
JANE
I don’t know.
ERHARD
Did you have a bond with your dad?
JANE
Yeah and she broke it.
