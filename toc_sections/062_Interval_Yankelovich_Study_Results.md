SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
You have no idea: she struggles with being on time.
MARY
Yeah.
ERHARD
So now it’s okay with him.
(laughter)
JAKE
I believe that people’s intentions are important. Let’s take a poll.
ERHARD
If we took a poll 100 years ago, somebody in here would be burned as a witch.
JAKE
That’s true.
Another participant, Paul, spoke up while remaining seated.
PAUL
In some languages making promises sometimes involves using a special tense that says you
might not arrive.
ERHARD  (laughing)
When I arrive, if I do...
PAUL
It’s characteristic of other languages. In Spanish there’s all these subjunctive tenses. You can
say: “When you do this for me, then I’ll do that.” It’s subjunctive, it’s something we don’t recog-
nize in our language. It’s recognized as theoretical. Maybe that’s what you’re getting at.
ERHARD
No it’s not, but what you’ve said is useful nevertheless for what I am getting at: that you will
present yourself as a person who will do what you said you will do, and you don’t do what you
say you will do. In fact maybe you will do it and maybe you won’t. That’s inauthentic.
PAUL
Well, I wouldn’t agree.
Forum Day One: Session Two
49
ERHARD
Why don’t you stand up for a while?
PAUL  (standing and receiving a microphone)
To me being inauthentic is to say you’re going to do something without fully intending to do it.
That’s inauthentic to me.
ERHARD
Try to keep in mind I’ve been discussing this for seventeen years with people almost as smart as
you are. And I’m still saying this thing. I haven’t met the person, although I haven’t met anyone
as smart as you...
PAUL
Nor have I met anybody as smart as you.
ERHARD
You don’t know that.
PAUL
I know I don’t, but neither do you know what you are saying.
ERHARD
Oh, you’re going to do your program with me, right?
PAUL
Oh no, I’m just...
ERHARD
Wait, wait. I don’t know a word for that except “asshole.”
(laughter)
If someone pays $625 to come in and take my course and they take the time to do their course
with me for free, that’s an asshole.
PAUL
You’re playing with words.
ERHARD
What isn’t playing with words?
PAUL
Well anything nonverbal is obviously not playing with words.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Really? Are you a linguist?
PAUL
Yeah, I speak three languages.
ERHARD
I didn’t ask if you speak three languages, I asked if you understood language. Is that your busi-
ness? Is language your business?
PAUL
No, but I speak several languages.
ERHARD
How many people in this room speak several languages?
(many hands raised)
I have a lot of respect for people who speak several languages. I don’t mean any disrespect, but
it doesn’t mean you know shit about language.
PAUL
Well, language encompasses a pattern of thought, a process of thought. It’s contained within
the language you think within. Like I was referring to with Spanish, you have within the lan-
guage incorporated a structure for dealing with the fact that some things are hypothetical, some
things are real...
ERHARD  (to the group)
You want to listen to this very carefully, because otherwise you’re going to stand up and do this.
And I’m going to let him do this long enough that you can see what it looks like. Go on Paul.
PAUL
The point is, I agree, that to be inauthentic is to, you’re saying that it is to, to do something, to
say you’re going to do something and, nobody knows, I could say I’m going to walk over here,
and the world may end before I get there.
ERHARD
That’s not my point. That’s not what I said.
PAUL
Well, what is the point?
Forum Day One: Session Two
51
ERHARD
The point is, to present your self in one way and be another way is inauthentic.
PAUL
Yeah, that’s true.
ERHARD
That’s what I said from the beginning. It’s like I said one and one is two, and then you say,
“Well, not always...”
PAUL
But that doesn’t account for intention. There are some things within one person’s realm of con-
trol and other things that aren’t.
ERHARD
You’re nutty about this too.
(pointing to Jake)
I want you to listen here. We’ll get this now. I don’t know if he’ll get it, but you’ll get it.
PAUL
I’m trying to clarify the distinction.
ERHARD
Hold on. I understand. See, look: I didn’t say anything about intention. You brought that up,
actually it was Jake, but in this conversation, you brought that up.
PAUL
Yes.
ERHARD
I said that “inauthentic” was to present yourself in one way, and be another way. That’s pretty
goddamn simple, isn’t it?
PAUL
Sure, yeah.
ERHARD
And is that inauthentic?
52
SPEAKING BEING
PAUL
Yes, if that is your way of being.
ERHARD
That is what I said. I said if you present yourself in one way, and you’re actually being another
way, that’s inauthentic. Right?
PAUL
Sure, if you’re mindful of the fact that you’re that other way.
ERHARD
Well how about if the moon comes up blue with pink polka dots?
PAUL
Well...
ERHARD
How about if the world ends in 30 seconds? My question is: Why are you coming up with these
little things about intentionality, when what I’m saying is very simple?
PAUL
Well, because it implies will.
ERHARD
It doesn’t imply anything. If you present yourself one way, when in fact you are another way,
that’s inauthentic. If it says gold stamped on a thing and it’s not gold, that’s inauthentic.
PAUL
No.
ERHARD
It’s when you present yourself one way, and you’re another way—that’s inauthentic.
PAUL
Well, I don’t agree, but still. I think that’s the wrong word.
ERHARD (to Jake)e
Do you get that he doesn’t agree with that?
JAKE
Can I respond to what you’re saying?
Forum Day One: Session Two
53
ERHARD
Did you get that he doesn’t agree with that?
JAKE
We’re not exactly aligned.
ERHARD
I understand that. Jake, you’re not exactly aligned from exactly the same place.
(addressing the two men)
You’re both nutty about your word. He’s coming from the same thing. If you thought it was gold
t
and you stamped gold on it, then it’s really gold. You hear how stupid that sounds?
JAKE
Yeah.
ERHARD
That’s what you said.
JAKE
I didn’t say that.
ERHARD (indicating Paul)
That’s what he said. Pretty stupid what he said, isn’t it? If you thought it was gold and you
t
stamped gold on it, then it’s really gold. That’s what really counts, what you intended. Right?
JAKE
It doesn’t make it authentic, but it doesn’t make me dishonest. It doesn’t make me a liar either.
ERHARD  (to the group)
I’m taking all this time with this bullshit because I want to accomplish something. No mat-
ter what I bring up, somebody will have a thing about it. Somebody will be nutty about it. No
matter what they’re saying, it’s obvious these two guys are intelligent. But they’ve got their foot
nailed to the fl oor, so it’s like talking to stupid people. Being stuck makes you stupid. There’s no
power available where you’ve got your foot nailed to the fl oor. All this conversation regarding
intention, in response to my simple statement about authenticity, indicates that there’s some
nuttiness there. The point is, at some point, you will be that person.
(to Jake)
And to settle this conversation: I ask you to stand in—that a person who presents himself one
way, and in fact acts another way, for any reason, is inauthentic. That’s not true. It’s a “take the
case that” I’m asking you to stand in. Is that clear?
“
There’s no power available where you’ve got
your foot nailed to the floor.

SPEAKING BEING
Jake nodded and then sat down.
ERHARD (to Paul)
Did you get what I said to him?
PAUL
Yeah, so, what you’re saying is that specifi c instance you didn’t do what you said, you’re inau-
thentic, and I would agree with you there, but...
ERHARD
I don’t want your agreement. I want you to create this square.
(drawing an imaginary square on the fl oor in front of Paul)
Inside that square is a diff erent world. Inside that world, when you act one way and present
yourself another way, that’s inauthentic.
PAUL
Specifi cally, or generally?
ERHARD
Generally. Just in that world. It’s not true in the rest of the world. Can you handle that?
PAUL
Yeah. I’m not sure what it applies to, but...
ERHARD
It doesn’t apply to anything. Can you handle that?
PAUL
Yeah.
ERHARD
Stand in that square and listen to what I say next. Because only standing there will what I’m
about to say make any sense. All right? You ready to stand in that square?
(to Paul)
You ready? So in that little square, I know it’s not true, and it’s not that way in the rest of the
world, and for those for whom one and one is two, when you pretend to be one way and act
another, that’s called inauthentic. When you own up to this, that’s being authentic about your
inauthenticity. Anybody not get that? That’s the beginning of authenticity. Authenticity does not
AUTHENTICITY
Here Erhard provides a counterintuitive, but very Heideggerian
premise: authenticity is possible only with the development
of an authentic relationship with our own inauthenticity. Here
authenticity is an act of ownership, of owning the calculative
clearing which we are, of accepting the particular gift  of Being
whose sending characterizes our epoch. Heidegger introduced
this idea in Being and Time, where he employed the term
“resoluteness” to characterize Dasein’s state of having-
appropriated; he described this resoluteness as an empowering
authenticity toward one’s own inauthenticity:
Resoluteness appropriates untruth authen-
tically. Dasein is already in irresoluteness,
and soon, perhaps, will be in it again. . . . The
irresoluteness of the “they” remains domi-
nant, notwithstanding, but it cannot impugn
resolute existence. (BT 345)
“
This idea lies at the heart of the appropriative event: in
the context of having appropriated one’s inauthenticity, that
inauthenticity, which persists, is nevertheless transformed.
It is an idea which defies our usual thinking: ontically, such a
“transformation” can only be seen as blatant self-justification, a
philosophically sophisticated rationalization for accepting one’s
worst nature. Ontologically, however, appropriation justifies
nothing. Appropriation appropriates; it gives Being. Resoluteness,
then, is “the opening up of human being, out of its captivity in
that which is, to the openness of Being” (“OWA” in PLT 67). Much
of The Forum is devoted to developing the possibility of a non-
justificatory event of appropriation. ■

begin with being authentic. Authenticity begins with being authentic about your inauthenticity.
If you’re ever going to have any degree of authenticity the only way to get there is to start with
being authentic about your inauthenticity.
(to the group)
I’m not interested in your belief systems, I’m not interested in your values, I’m not interested in
your principles. So no more conversations like I just had with Jake and Paul. I don’t mean don’t
say anything, I mean don’t preach. I’ll do all the preaching in here, and if I’m any good, I won’t
do any either. All I’m asking when I talk to you about the things I’m talking about is: build
a square, stand inside of it, look out at life and the world and see what you can see standing
in that square and standing in that possibility. If it empowers you to stand there, keep it. If it
doesn’t empower you to stand there, destroy it. Simple.
BELLA
You said to someone else that something happened when they were a child. I remembered. My
father was a liar, and I decided I could never be that. I had to be honest. I’ve had no freedom to
keep my word.
ERHARD
You can’t be anything you’re forced to be. Anything you are forced to be, you aren’t.
BELLA
I couldn’t stand the feeling.
ERHARD
Yeah.
(to the group)
Who couldn’t stand being a liar?
(several raise their hands)
You think a truth teller would fi nd lying absolutely abhorrent? For the person who tells the
truth you don’t have any problem with a lie, it’s only somebody down in the swamp, in the bot-
tom of the Valley of the Shadow of Death, who is afraid they might be a liar. I know you know
better.
BELLA
I am a liar.
ERHARD
Yeah. You are a liar. That’s being authentic about being inauthentic. And that’s the beginning of
authenticity—and the beginning of the freedom to tell the truth.
“
All I’m asking when I talk to you about the
things I’m talking about is: build a square,
stand inside of it, look out at life and the
world and see what you can see standing in
that square and standing in that possibility.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (to the group)
I know most of you don’t get that, but never mind. Just listen. What today and tomorrow is
about mostly is about being authentic about being inauthentic. So there are a couple of things
to get. One: you present yourself as someone who keeps your word, but in fact you are someone
who does or does not keep your word depending on whether you feel like it. Is that the truth
about you? I told you I don’t know the truth. See if it’s empowering—like trying on a robe.
Two: when you can wear that robe, that’s called being authentic about your own inauthenticity.
Always, the beginning of authenticity is being authentic about your own inauthenticity. I want
you to treat the promises in here diff erently from usual. I want you to say “regardless.” When it’s
all over, maybe you will, maybe you won’t. Sincerity is pure story. I’m asking you to engage in
these promises as a matter of integrity, not sincerity. As a matter of fact, standing in the back-
ground is always the possibility that you may not. But then you won’t, and that’s that.
At 3:12 pm, The Forum adjourned for a second break.

SPEAKING BEING
Dasein: Meaning and Mineness
Dasein is Martin Heidegger’s name for the central figure in his 1927 magnum opus,
Being and Time. The term is one of the few in Heidegger’s writing that consistently
remains untranslated from the German: the most literal translation of Da-Sein is be-
ing-there. Scholar Hubert Dreyfus suggests that the best way to understand Dasein
is to think of “our term ‘human being,’ which can refer to a way of being that is char-
acteristic of all people or to a specific person—a human being” (Hubert L. Dreyfus,
Being-in-the-World 14).
But the term being-there itself indicates the essential characteristic that distin-
guishes humans from other beings. Dasein is being-there because it is the only being
for whom its Being is an issue. Humans are the beings who reflect upon themselves,
and the only ones who exist in a world of meaning. We dwell in a meaningful “there,”
and we bring our “there” along with us when we show up. Other beings inhabit the
earth; human beings live in a world.
This is a challenging and essential aspect of the thinking Heidegger is devel-
oping here, and a distinction that emerges persistently over the four days of The
Forum. The meanings of the things in our world are not properties of the things
themselves. Non-human beings are “entities whose kind of Being is of a charac-
ter other than Dasein’s,” and therefore they must be understood as “unmeaning,
essentially devoid of any meaning at all” (BT 193). When Heidegger says that “only
Dasein can be meaningful or meaningless,” he is saying that other beings can have or
lack meaning only when they are encountered by Dasein and are thereby disclosed as
meaningful or not (BT 192–193). Consider: a dog may not be “a dog” for another dog,
nor may the dog see “beauty” in a sunset. Dasein is the only being in whose world
there is meaning. Only for human beings do things show up as the things they are.
Further, Dasein is the only being for whom existence is always an issue, and the
issue for each Dasein is always fundamentally its own existence. Heidegger calls this
human characteristic mineness: the Being of human beings, while it characterizes
the ontological nature of the collective, always occurs as the Being of a particular
human being. Therefore, while Dasein is not a person, we have to talk about it as if
it were: “Because Dasein has in each case mineness, one must always use a personal
pronoun when one addresses it: ‘I am,’ ‘you are’” (BT 68).
Each Dasein relates to this existential situation in a particular way. “Mineness
belongs to any existent Dasein, and belongs to it as the condition which makes
authenticity and inauthenticity possible” (BT 78, emphasis added). That is, my
SESSION TWO INTERVAL
Dasein is always mine, but whether or not that relationship is authentic—as Werner
Erhard would put it, whether I own the condition of mineness, or whether it owns
me—depends upon an act of existential choice. The purpose of The Forum is to
bring participants face-to-face with that choice, thereby making available the possi-
bility of authentic existence.
