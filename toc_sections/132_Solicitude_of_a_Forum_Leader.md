SPEAKING BEING
PETER
Anything I can think of is a description.
ERHARD
Yeah, it’s okay. That’s right. And every time you say it, I’m going to say that’s a
description, and what’s underneath that? Why? Because—you know, I’m going
to say this a thousand times today, I can feel it coming—because it’s the inquiry
where the power is, not the information you derive from the inquiry. Look,
we’ve invented a new technology. We’ve invented a technology called ontologi-
cal inquiry. Really, that’s wrong. We’ve invented a technology called ontological
design. The way you do ontological design is like Peter and I are doing it: “May-
be it’s this. But how could it be that? What’s underneath that? Well, underneath
that is this. Okay, but how could it be that? What’s underneath that?” And
somehow, if Peter and I are doing it correctly, when we’re all done, neither of us
will know anything we didn’t know before, but life will be an opening for that
into which we’ve inquired. So Peter and I will find ourselves, not remembering
what to do to be leaders, or not remembering what property we need to have
to be leaders, but rather we will find ourselves being leaders. . . . Because I say
that a well-designed, rigorous inquiry, while not leading to answers, while not
leading to information, while not leading necessarily to understanding, leads to
an opening, like a possibility, like a clearing, for that into which I’m inquiring.
ERHARD
No. Can’t see commitment. It’s not a presence. I don’t mean you can’t see it,
therefore it’s not a presence, but I’m trying to kind of engage you into: how do
you inquire into presence? So is commitment ever present? No, that’s always a
conversation, an assessment about what’s going on there. . . . What’s actually
going on there?
PETER
I don’t know.
ERHARD
Try this: something about unrestrained action? Maybe something like unre-
strained action, maybe something like consistent action? Maybe something like
repetitive action, maybe something like action powerful enough to meet a resis-
tance? I don’t know. See, I don’t know, and I don’t care about the answer! What
I care about is establishing ourselves in the domain of leadership as a presence.
That’s what this is all about. It’s a trick. This is not really to get the answer. We’re
not going to give you a test to see if you got the answers right aft erwards. . . .
PETER
It’s action without concern.
ERHARD
Okay. Good. Now, what does concern mean? See, no matter what he says, I’m
going to have a question, aren’t I? Why? Because I don’t care about the answer!

SPEAKING BEING
Erhard was on the platform as the second session began at 1:15 pm.
ERHARD
So I’m willing to tell you The Answer now. You’re not going to like the answer. What you get
after sitting on a mountaintop for twenty years—what you get is—the answer is that there
isn’t any answer: and that is The Answer. Somewhere on the third day that will fall into place
for you. What we want to do is distinguish a racket. The problem is that you don’t know what
distinguishing is. First we need to distinguish distinction. When you and I distinguish some-
thing, it’s not the same as defi ning it. Distinguishing and defi ning are two diff erent operations.
And distinguishing is not describing. When you distinguish something you are not describing it.
What is it that defi ning does? When you defi ne something, what does that do for you?
PARTICIPANT
You set up a boundary, or a limit.
ERHARD
Right on. When you defi ne something, what you do is to take a mass of undefi ned stuff , and
you draw a kind of line that divides what you’re defi ning from what you’re not defi ning. Also,
defi ning indicates something with reference to something else, something you’re not familiar
with in relation to something you are familiar with. Distinguishing doesn’t work like that.
Defi ning objectifi es something. When you defi ne something you turn it into an object. Defi ning
gives it a form, a location in space and time, turns it into a thing. And we’re all comfortable with
things. When you distinguish you don’t turn it into an object. And that’s why distinguishing
makes people uncomfortable. Because while it exists by virtue of being distinguished, it doesn’t
exist as a thing.
(pausing)
So we’re going to take a little bit of a look at what distinguishing might be. Defi ning identifi es;
distinguishing sets up a realm. You don’t need to understand that yet. Just have it like, “He says
distinguishing sets up a realm.” 2, and 9, and 74 are numbers. But number is not itself a num-
r
ber. It’s a realm in which numbers can happen. Number distinguishes a realm of possibility.
Erhard called on a participant to stand up.
ERHARD (to participant)t
How many loops in one square foot of rug?
PARTICIPANT
A couple thousand.
ERHARD
You know exactly how many: a lot. If I take one loop away, how many are there? The exact same
number. The number is called a lot. We can’t distinguish between that number and that number
minus one. A lot minus one is still a lot. You have no way to see the diff erence between a lot and

a lot minus one. Conceptually they’re diff erent, but conceptually the world is fl at. We’re talking
about the way the rug occurs for you. Similarly, we’re told that there are cultures, societies, in
which the number system goes up to seven.
(holding up eight fi ngers)
That would look like many.
(holding up nine fi ngers)
So would that.
(to the group)
You’ve got to get this, you see. This is one of those things you’ve got to get. Now we’re going to talk
about two... like t-w-o. Pretend you’re in a culture with no numbers at all. You’ve got only none,
one, and many.
(holding up two sheets of paper)r
If I said that was two, you’d say, “All right.”
(holding up two rulers)
If I said that’s two, you’d say, “okay.”
He continued, holding up two erasers, then two fi ngers, each time responding with increasing cer-
tainty as the imaginary tribesperson—until he held up one ruler
and one eraser.
ERHARD (continuing)
Can you see that you’d say, “I don’t know”? Two diff erent things would not occur for you as
t
“two.” However, after a few examples of diff erent things as two, you would eventually get that.
(holding up two things in one hand and one thing in the other)r
A new level to get, which would again require demonstration by examples. Then another new
level.
(holding up one fi nger)r
A set and an empty set. You’d never get this as two. No set of examples, however large, ever
distinguishes two. It only describes or defi nes two. You can’t invent new twos when you’ve just
got a defi nition of two. When you distinguish two, what you do is create a realm of possibility
in which things can occur, arise, as two. You can’t ever invent without a distinction. Defi nitions
limit, distinctions open up. What you are doing when you are distinguishing is creating, open-
ing up a context in which what you are distinguishing can occur, can happen. Is that starting
to get clear? What you’re doing now is very diff erent. You are distinguishing distinction. That’s a
little bit like putting your hands underneath your feet and lifting yourself up.
PARTICIPANT
How would you distinguish two?
THINKING
The kind of thinking that Martin Heidegger was distinguishing in
his writing has not been available for human beings. We can’t think
this way because this way of thinking has not yet been thought
as a possibility, and therefore it is none of the things which
already-thought ideas always are: understandable, consistent
within themselves, or consistent with our other thoughts. It is not
yet already-available for assertion or evaluation. It must first be
unconcealed.
Heidegger’s first step in bringing forth this unthought think-
ing is to distinguish our current thinking as “our current thinking”
rather than simply as “thinking.” Essential to an inquiry into the
possibility of thinking, Heidegger says, is an inquiry into what
thinking is for us now: what we presently think about thinking,
what we presently define as thinking, and—since our thinking
gives us our being—what we are that thinking is (WCT 17). We must
T
begin to think the diff erence between the possibility of thinking
and whatever it is that we are doing now in the name of thinking,
so that the diff erence becomes the opening for the possibility. The
development of this distinction—a new way of thinking—is central
to Werner Erhard’s work, as it is to Heidegger’s; therefore we will
mention here several of the ways in which Heidegger characterizes
the thinking he is attempting.
