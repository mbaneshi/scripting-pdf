SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
Which risk?
JOAN
Choosing. Choosing to be out there.
KIPP
Right. That is the risk. That’s what everybody here is up against. Nobody here is interested in liv-
ing their lives; they are very interested in having their reasons design their life—their thoughts,
their feelings, their considerations, not them, “not me! Then I couldn’t complain!” See, if you 
choose, you can’t complain. It’s what everybody in here is up against. And what it is to be a
human being is to avoid responsibility. You cannot make somebody else responsible. You’ve 
already tried doing that. You can’t even make yourself responsible. You can only choose to be
responsible. But we haven’t distinguished responsibility yet. Choice equals freedom because it’s 
you choosing, not some reason.  I didn’t say reasons were bad. They just don’t give you: you!
JOAN
I got it.
KIPP
Thanks for staying with it.
Another participant stood.
ROSS
Somewhere along the line I got stuck in that you have to choose yes, and that if you choose no, 
it’s not a real choice.
KIPP
No, no, no, they are both the same. A choice is a choice. So “I choose no because I choose no.”
ROSS
Whenever I’m presented with a choice...
KIPP
Notice how you said that: as if it is an edict. “Whenever I’m presented with a choice, at all times...”
ROSS
Sometimes when I am presented with a choice, I choose yes because, who would say no?
KIPP
But that’s not a choice then. That’s the reason: “Why would somebody say no?” That’s a deci-
sion, not a choice. A choice is a choice. You choosing for no reason, simply because you say so.
