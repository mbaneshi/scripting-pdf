SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (to the group)
I know most of you don’t get that, but never mind. Just listen. What today and tomorrow is
about mostly is about being authentic about being inauthentic. So there are a couple of things
to get. One: you present yourself as someone who keeps your word, but in fact you are someone
who does or does not keep your word depending on whether you feel like it. Is that the truth
about you? I told you I don’t know the truth. See if it’s empowering—like trying on a robe. 
Two: when you can wear that robe, that’s called being authentic about your own inauthenticity.
Always, the beginning of authenticity is being authentic about your own inauthenticity. I want 
you to treat the promises in here diff erently from usual. I want you to say “regardless.” When it’s 
all over, maybe you will, maybe you won’t. Sincerity is pure story. I’m asking you to engage in 
these promises as a matter of integrity, not sincerity. As a matter of fact, standing in the back-
ground is always the possibility that you may not. But then you won’t, and that’s that.
At 3:12 pm, The Forum adjourned for a second break.
