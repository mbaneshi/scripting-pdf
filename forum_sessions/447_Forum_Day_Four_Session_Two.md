KIPP (pointing up

Bill, why is the ceiling up there?
BILL
Because it’s up there.
KIPP (pointing at a participant

But Bill, why is Ashley like that?
BILL
Because Ashley’s like that.
KIPP (pointing at another participant
(
)
Wait a second Bill, why is John like that?
BILL
Because John is like that.
KIPP
Yeah, but Bill, what is the sound of one hand clapping?
BILL (to laughter)r
I’ve heard this one before...
He took a long time mulling over this, trying various answers: “it’s nonexistent,” “there is no sound,”
etc. Kipp repeated the prompts for the fl oor and the ceiling, and then returning to the sound of one
hand clapping.
BILL (to laughter)r
It can’t manifest a sound. It must have something to do with the fl oor and the ceiling.
KIPP
Human beings love logic. It’s all got to be logical. Right? What is the sound of one hand clap-
ping?
BILL
There is no sound.
KIPP
Where you are looking there is no sound. But the sound of one hand clapping is what? It’s
simply what?

SPEAKING BEING
BILL
Simply, it’s nonexistent.
KIPP
Or: The fl oor is down there because...
BILL
There’s no “because” to the fl oor being down there.
KIPP
The fl oor is down there because...
BILL
There’s no reason for it to be down there.
KIPP
And the fl oor is down there because...
BILL (laughing)
It doesn’t have a because. Because somebody built it and stuck it there.
KIPP
The fl oor is down there because...
BILL
I shouldn’t have volunteered to continue with this. I seem to be losing it.
KIPP
That’s fi ne. That’s the diff erence between a distinction and a defi nition. You can’t get a distinc-
tion by defi ning it, or exampling it; you can only get it by creating it... So the fl oor is down there
because... Okay, forget about the fl oor, but the ceiling’s up there because...
BILL (looking up)
Because it’s there.
KIPP
Where? Up there, right? The ceiling’s up there because it’s up there.
BILL
...because the ceiling’s up there. Is that correct?
