people have graduated from The Forum, either the four-day Forum of Erhard‚Äôs time
through 1991, or the current iteration of the course, the three-day Landmark
Forum¬†(www.landmarkworldwide.com).1
Erhard‚Äôs influence on the culture has made itself felt in another way as well.
During the 1970s, when it sometimes seemed that every fifth person in San Francis-
co was an est graduate, you could generally detect that element of the population
t
by their use of the program‚Äôs language, which in casual use began to be heard as
jargon. Erhard‚Äôs use of this terminology, however, was highly purposive, and many
of those words and phrases made their way into the public sphere, some to last-
ing effect. An example has been the shift in the popular understanding of the term
sharing. Before est, people shared a cookie or a bench in the park; what was shared
was divided, and in the process one‚Äôs own share was inevitably diminished. But
in the est Training,
g participants shared their experience, and through sharing, that
experience was augmented. To share, in the world of est, was to communicate in
such a way that one‚Äôs self and not merely one‚Äôs story was made available, leaving the
f
other touched rather than merely informed. This meaning of the word, we assert, is
now common in our culture. Likewise, the term coaching, borrowed by Erhard from
the sports arena in the early eighties to identify the style of his pedagogy, has since
become ubiquitous in the field of management, human resources, and executive
coaching. And the ubiquitous Mastercard catchphrase, ‚ÄúMaster the possibilities,‚Äù
was born in the mind of an est graduate for whom the term
t
possibility had acquired
a new level of meaning; however, through overuse in the media, this new level of
meaning has diminished.
The move to discontinue the Training in 1985 and replace it with The Forum
arose from Erhard‚Äôs perception of a shift in the culture‚Äôs way of responding to the
Training; he wanted to design a course that was responsive to that shift. At this
point, while Erhard‚Äôs success during those years had been greeted by considerable
media curiosity, scholarly interest was moderate. Several studies of the est Training
t
attempted to measure its effects using a psychological model; while he considered
such efforts valuable, Erhard has asserted that this approach is inappropriate for
analysis of his work. His work, he says, is not psychological but ontological: his
concern is the being of human beings (‚ÄúHeart of the Matter‚Äù 1984). He has also
consistently emphasized that the focus of his work is the development of the lan-
guage in which it is articulated. Yet no significant scholarly work dealing either with
Erhard‚Äôs language use, or with the nature of an ontological methodology, has been
published, even in the academic fields most likely to be deeply concerned with
such matters‚Äîrhetoric and writing studies, business management, philosophy, and
communication studies. This book aims to begin to correct that omission.
Before proceeding, we offer this statement of authorial stance: The authors
have engaged extensively, both as participants and as scholars, in numerous pro-
grams designed by Werner Erhard. The senior author took the est Training for the
t
first time in 1973, and we have each participated a number of times in The Forum,
both during Erhard‚Äôs tenure in the organization and following his departure. Our
doctoral dissertations (University of Southern California, 1990; University of Arizona,
2008) consisted of rhetorical and philosophical analyses of The Forum. Based upon
this considerable study and experience, our assessment of Erhard‚Äôs work is un-
equivocal: we have found this work to be pedagogically effective and intellectually
significant in all of its historical iterations. Our intention in this book is to stimulate
its serious consideration by the academic community, as well as by others in the
culture at large.
It is also important to note that our approach as participant observers has
its limits. To carry out the design of the book, we have precluded a number of
approaches that readers may wish to see addressed, and we beg those readers to
indulge us. Before any significant and critical treatments could be viable, or even
possible, from a number of disciplines‚Äîincluding philosophy, communication stud-
ies, rhetorical criticism, and so on‚Äîthe phenomenon must be first made available.
We present this book as a way into the phenomenon in question, and consequently,
we invite members from a range of academic disciplines to enter the conversation
we are seeking to initiate.
Evolution
This is an historical document. It presents an account of one moment‚Äîalbeit a sig-
nificant one‚Äîin an ongoing project for the development of human being. The first
iteration of this project, the est Training, was designed to communicate to people
t
living in the cultural environment of the 1970s. As Erhard saw it, considerable logis-
tical rigor was required for the course to achieve its purpose, and thus the format
included demands for which est soon became notorious, including lengthy sessions
t
1 Landmark describes The Landmark Forum as a personal and professional development program,
based on the discipline of applied ontology and phenomenology. Erhard created the work in the
early 1970s and continued its development until in 1991 Landmark took over its ongoing devel-
opment as expressed in The Landmark Forum and other Landmark programs. As of the writing of
this book, the material and structure of The Forum have continued to be developed during three
decades since the 1989 Forum presented in this book. The Landmark Forum of today (circa 2019)
is less time (three days and an evening and each day ends by 10:00 pm), it incorporates the use of
PowerPoint displays and videos that enhance the participants‚Äô experience of and access to what is
being presented, and there is no use of profanity on the part of the program leaders.

with limited bathroom breaks, a highly confrontational interaction style‚Äîwith
the use of expletives‚Äîand the surrender of all wristwatches at the door. These
demands were modified when The Forum replaced the Training; and in subsequent
years, as the communication paradigm of the culture has continued to shift, the
delivery of The Forum has altered accordingly.
On the one hand, of course, The Forum conversation inevitably challenges
participants‚Äô familiar way of seeing things. Ontological inquiry‚Äîpedagogy such as
The Forum, that aims to get beyond mere conceptual knowledge‚Äîis of necessity
rigorous and sometimes uncomfortable. In Martin Heidegger‚Äôs words, authentic in-
quiry into Being always ‚Äúhas the character of doing violence, whether to the claims
of the everyday interpretation, or to its complacency and tranquillized obviousness‚Äù
(BT 359). But while the conversation in the current Landmark Forum remains rigor-
T
ous, participants will find a presentation that can for the most part be described as
gentler, and more user-friendly, than the one presented in this book.
A further aspect of this difference, of course, has to do with Werner Erhard‚Äôs
personal style. In his delivery of both the Training and The Forum, Erhard‚Äôs com-
munication was edgily playful and relentlessly purposive. He called his approach
ruthless compassion; and it included a profound sense of humor and Socratic
irony implicit in the human condition. To communicate the humor as well as the
compassion, he often provoked and insulted participants, using language gener-
ally considered inappropriate for such a setting (in a parody of one of his favorite
epithets, graduates of the Training were sometimes referred to as ‚Äúestholes‚Äù). Yet, as
this book shows, those participants who initially resisted these intrusions inevitably
got the message. Erhard has related this confrontive aspect of his communication
to his 1971 experience of transformation: ‚ÄúOn the bridge,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúall of a sudden I
could be 100% responsible for everything in my life, and at the same time none of it
had any significance. At that point you are free and fearless‚Äù (Erhard, interview with
authors). Erhard‚Äôs communication style, and his humor, remain on full display in this
book; the authors see them as important and entertaining aspects of the historical
account we are presenting here.
Erhard Encounters Heidegger
Despite the shift we have cited here in The Forum‚Äôs style and tone, a central thesis
of this book is that from the first offering of the est Training in 1971, through its
t
replacement by the Forum in 1985 and its current iteration as the Landmark Forum,
the process at the heart of this pedagogy has retained its transformational
dynamic. This dynamic, as we will show, arises in the unspoken ontological realm
of The Forum conversation as it proceeds, and has been the essential element of the
course through all of its terminological variations.
During the transition to The Forum, Erhard excised many of the est Training‚Äôs
t
more meditative exercises and incorporated into the course a new vocabulary and
redesigned procedures, with the stated intention that participants would have an
enhanced experience of creating a new realm of possibility for themselves and their
y
lives. At about this time, through colleagues, he was introduced to the work of the
twentieth-century German philosopher Martin Heidegger. Erhard was taken with the
way Heidegger‚Äôs thinking reverberated with his own, and he consulted with several
Heideggerian scholars on the subject. Two of them‚ÄîHubert Dreyfus of University of
California, Berkeley and Michael E. Zimmerman of Tulane‚Äîprovided formal assess-
ments of the est Training‚Äôs effectiveness, and noted its consistencies with elements
t
of Heidegger‚Äôs thought. When Erhard‚Äôs revised technology emerged in The Forum
and other redesigned courses, significant Heideggerian terminology was included
in its rhetorical mix, and Erhard occasionally read passages from Heidegger in his
presentations.
Most significantly, Erhard saw that Heidegger‚Äôs ideas and his own were commu-
nicating from the same unspoken realm, and that the specifications of the two vo-
cabularies could be merged to communicate that realm more powerfully: ‚ÄúI learned
from Heidegger,‚Äù said Erhard, ‚Äúnuances of what I had been saying that clarified and
made more potent what was there‚Äù (Erhard, interview with authors).
What was there was Erhard‚Äôs technology of language for the communication of
being, and its ability, in both the Training and The Forum, to consistently and pow-
erfully evoke an experience that participants found transformative. The evocation
of that experience has remained The Forum‚Äôs essential element; Erhard‚Äôs encounter
with Heidegger enriched the vocabulary in which he could see into it more pro-
foundly and communicate it more effectively.
Technology
The form of this study will be comparative analysis: we will demonstrate that the
work of Werner Erhard is aligned in significant ways with the philosophy of Martin
Heidegger, and that a comparison of their work illuminates the thinking of both
men. We will show that The Forum‚Äôs dialogic form introduces a performative dimen-
sion of Heidegger‚Äôs ontological vocabulary in a way that Heidegger himself, working
within a restrictive academic and political culture, was unable to do. We propose
that The Forum conversation is ontological rhetoric: purposive speaking that com-
municates and makes present a context of meaning that, if left unexamined, shapes
4
SPEAKING BEING
thesis is that the work of Werner Erhard makes available the ontological domain of
language, so that the decentering of subjectivity and the reinvention of the self can
be experienced as possibilities rather than merely considered as theory.
We recognize that this pedagogical model is in many ways a radical one, given
the strength of the assumptions embedded in our tradition; but Heidegger says that
an experience with language in the ontological domain always requires ‚Äúa leap.‚Äù
As our educational institutions struggle increasingly to generate an opening for the
human in the face of the advance of the technological, we argue that the situation is
critical, and that a leap of this kind is in order.
The Plan of the Book
The central text for this book, located in the left and right columns on either page,
is the combination of two sources: notes taken by the senior author while observing
a Forum in San Francisco led by Werner Erhard in December 1989, and a transcrip-
tion of the video of the same four-day event made available to the junior author on
location at Landmark Worldwide‚Äôs archives. While the transcript provides compre-
hensive and detailed conversations of the actual 1989 Forum, there are important
alterations that must be accounted for. First and foremost, all names have been
altered except for Werner Erhard, and actual names have been used only for those
participants who speak more than once or twice with Erhard or the other two indi-
viduals leading the course (‚ÄúKipp‚Äù and ‚ÄúWes‚Äù). In addition, some conversations have
been edited out, or summarized, for the sake of space. For instance, all discussions
dealing with the Six-Day Course, discontinued in 1990, have been removed. Also
missing from the transcript is the Evening Session of the 1989 Forum: there was
no extant video recording of that event. However, that omission can be rectified
for interested readers if they were to attend an evening session of The Landmark
Forum, where participants will share their experience of the course for guests they
themselves have invited.
We call the text that accompanies the transcript either ‚Äúsidebars‚Äù or ‚Äúintervals.‚Äù
Sidebars occur in the central columns between the far left and right panes that
house the transcript of The Forum, and the intervals occur between sessions of the
course, and at the conclusion of each of the four days. In the sidebars and intervals
are relevant ideas from the thinking of Martin Heidegger. Sometimes the connection
between a sidebar and the transcript it accompanies may be apparent; sometimes
it may be intended obliquely, as a hint at the background. Intervals are more often
oblique in this way due to the focus on Heidegger‚Äôs thinking in its wider arcs, for
and limits our way of being. However, this context of meaning cannot be spoken
directly. It becomes present by virtue of what is said.
The dynamic of Erhard‚Äôs technology of language responds directly to issues
raised by Heidegger in his 1954 essay, ‚ÄúThe Question Concerning Technology‚Äù (Basic
Writings). Technology‚Äôs essence, proposes Heidegger, is its relentless demand that
all of nature, including human beings, be placed in standing reserve, on call for the
uses of technology itself.  The way of being evoked by this development (i.e., that we
ourselves function as ‚Äúcalculable material‚Äù in a cybernetic system designed to serve
ourselves) poses the danger that we may become lost in the profound reflexivity of
that system, and, most fatally, may forget that anything has been lost. Surrender to
technology ‚Äúthreatens man with the possibility that it could be denied to him to en-
ter into a more original revealing and hence to experience the call of a more primal
truth‚Äù (‚ÄúQCT‚Äù in BW 333). Such surrender, however, seems inevitable: the technolog-
W
ical epoch is where we have landed, the only way of being we have been provided,
and resistance is as futile as surrender is fatal.
But Heidegger suggests a middle path, a ‚Äúcomportment toward technology
which expresses ‚Äòyes‚Äô and at the same time ‚Äòno‚Äô‚Äù (DT 54). Further, he proposes that
T
‚Äúessential reflection upon technology and decisive confrontation with it must hap-
pen in a realm that is, on the one hand, akin to the essence of technology, and, on
the other, fundamentally different from it‚Äù(‚ÄúQCT‚Äù in BW 340). We suggest that Wer-
W
ner Erhard‚Äôs work provides such a realm. It is both a manifestation of the technolog-
ical epoch and a subversive appropriation of its impulse, a thinking which reaches
beyond the technological paradigm by reaching through that paradigm.
In Academia
For half a century, postmodern and poststructuralist theories across many disci-
plines have theorized a new freedom from the constraints of the Cartesian model
of human being. Human subjectivity has been decentered; the self is no longer
understood as the fixed and self-certain cogito but is open to creative reinvention;
language does not merely re-present a preexisting world of objective meanings, but
in fact generates the meanings that constitute that world.
These theoretical assertions concern being. But their effective communication
in the universities has been hindered by our epistemologically-based academic
tradition, which assumes that the central dynamic of education is knowing. This has
given rise to a pedagogical model in which the ontological domain must always re-
main merely conceptual, because being is not apprehended by knowing. The book‚Äôs

instance, the central theme of ‚Äúthe forgetting of Being,‚Äù which has eight parts.
Our purpose in this book is not to explain The Forum, or Heidegger‚Äôs philosophy‚Äî
although there are moments where we do provide analysis‚Äîbut rather, we primarily
aim to engage the reader in thinking Erhard‚Äôs and Heidegger‚Äôs ideas for themselves.
For readers who have previously participated in The Forum, we believe the con-
fluence here of Heidegger‚Äôs thinking with Erhard‚Äôs will enrich the way those readers
hold their Forum experience.  This has been true for the authors, and it is likewise
consistent with the experience of Werner Erhard, for whom exposure to Heidegger‚Äôs
thinking provided profound insights (Erhard, interview with authors). We intend that
this book, in a dialogue with its readers, will evoke such insights.
Martin Heidegger once cautioned his students not to focus too closely on the
concepts in his lectures, but rather to follow the ‚Äúmovement of showing‚Äù (OTB 2).
The Forum conversation, we assert, is a carefully designed movement in language
for the showing of being. In this book, we will show that showing. Our goal‚ÄîHeide-
gger‚Äôs, Erhard‚Äôs, the authors‚Äô‚Äîis the unconcealment of a powerful aspect of human
being with which we are, for the most part, unfamiliar.
While it may go without saying, reading this book will not provide an experience
of The Forum. We intend to hint at that experience, and we encourage readers for
whom our hints are provocative to seek out the experience for themselves. The Forum
occurs essentially as a dialogue; ontological inquiry demands interactive play, and
needs ‚Äúthe widest sphere in which to swing‚Äù (‚ÄúDL‚Äù in OWL 27). In written form, Heideg-
ger warned, ‚Äúthe movement of the questioning that is called for here might too easily
congeal‚Äù (‚ÄúDL‚Äù in OWL 50).
Nonetheless, as we undertake this project, the authors stand in the open ques-
tion: What is the possibility of communicating being? This is not a questioning that
seeks an answer; rather, the inquiry it generates persistently reflects the question
itself back upon the questioner, undermining comforting and limiting assumptions.
Thus we see it as a transformational question. We invite the reader to join us in this
inquiry.
Acknowledgments
It is impossible to list all those who have contributed significantly to the composi-
tion of this book; to do so with full integrity would mean naming all who have risked
what it means to hear the unsaid in what is said. In particular, our gratitude goes
to several extraordinary individuals without whom our work would have failed to
move beyond the planning stages, including first, Barbara Stevenson and Sheryl
