Forum Day Two: Session Three

ANGEL
So I’m inauthentic about caring.
ERHARD
Precisely. Now you have a great fucking act. It’s attractive, like bait.
Erhard sat on the edge of the platform, facing Angel. His tone was more forceful in this interaction
than it had been with Mike. Kipp again sat nearby.
ERHARD (continuing)
You attract people because you’re good at your act called caring. And you’re good at your act
called deeply feeling. So you get the fi sh up.
ANGEL
I was so good I believed it.
ERHARD
Exactly. See, underneath there is some kind of caring. I don’t know what the hell it is. Maybe
you care, I don’t know. That doesn’t interest me. I’ll tell you one thing. You’ll never be happy
being something you’re not, being your act. Ever. You’re never going to care enough, feel deeply
enough, to be happy, because none of that is who you are. And I don’t know what you are. You
may be caring. I don’t know. Neither do you. You only know what your act is. What there is to
get is that it’s an act. You’ve done a very good job of that standing there. And I know it isn’t easy.
You noticed how a lot of the stupidity for Mike started to go away near the end of that conver-
sation, interesting, right? Yeah. You want to relax for a little while; about this caring shit and
about being deeply feeling. You might want to enjoy yourself for a little while, having some fun
being shallow.
(laughter)r
See it doesn’t make any diff erence. This is a really important conversation because most of the
acts are going to look a little nasty. But a positive act is as detrimental as a negative one, in fact
it’s worse. She would have died like that. Shit. All the pain is pure bullshit, pure bullshit, noth-
ing authentic about the pain, not an iota of it. It’s all there to make you right. The pain’s not so
attractive anymore is it?
ANGEL
No.
ERHARD
What happened? You got divorced twice. Okay. That’s what happened, right? You got married.
Then you got divorced. You got married. Then you got
divorced. That’s all that happened. Not, “and I didn’t keep my vows, and nah nah nah nah.”
None of that ever happened.

SPEAKING BEING
ANGEL
Right.
ERHARD
When my dog walks up to you, and all he can tell is you smell good. That’s the whole story
about you for my dog. You’re starting to get how brutally stupid it’s been to waste your life feel-
ing badly about those stupid divorces. You know, you made a mistake. You know, I had seven
children. I never punished my children. I never decided on their punishment. In fact we never
talked about punishment. In life you do whatever you want, I’ve got certain rules. The rules are
not for you; they are for me. Don’t walk out in the street and get run over, I don’t want to see
you bloody. When you grow up you can do anything you want. When you’re around me don’t
get run over, I don’t want to see you bloody. You get run over there’s a consequence. When my
kids did something I would say, “You did it, good, now what’s the consequence?” “I shouldn’t
be allowed to eat for a week.”
(laughter)r
“Okay,” I would say, “I understand what you said, but we’re going to be a bit more lenient than
that.” Kids are nuts about punishing themselves. And you had a fi ve-year-old running her mar-
riage. You had to be the most caring person in the whole world. So when the marriage didn’t
work, like when I asked my kids what should happen to you because you did this, I should not
eat for a week. You had to make this enormous punishment for yourself.
ANGEL
Like I should not be happy for the rest of my life.
ERHARD
Precisely. Very good. I don’t want to see you cry any more about that. I want you to see how
stupid that is, how patently, brutally stupid. How old are you?
ANGEL
Thirty-two.
ERHARD
How old were you when you fi rst got married?
ANGEL
Twenty-one.
ERHARD
How old were you when you got divorced fi rst?
ANGEL
Twenty-fi ve.
