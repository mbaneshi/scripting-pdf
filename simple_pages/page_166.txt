SPEAKING BEING
ANGEL
Right.
ERHARD
When my dog walks up to you, and all he can tell is you smell good. That’s the whole story 
about you for my dog. You’re starting to get how brutally stupid it’s been to waste your life feel-
ing badly about those stupid divorces. You know, you made a mistake. You know, I had seven
children. I never punished my children. I never decided on their punishment. In fact we never 
talked about punishment. In life you do whatever you want, I’ve got certain rules. The rules are
not for you; they are for me. Don’t walk out in the street and get run over, I don’t want to see
you bloody. When you grow up you can do anything you want. When you’re around me don’t
get run over, I don’t want to see you bloody. You get run over there’s a consequence. When my 
kids did something I would say, “You did it, good, now what’s the consequence?” “I shouldn’t 
be allowed to eat for a week.”
(laughter)r
“Okay,” I would say, “I understand what you said, but we’re going to be a bit more lenient than 
that.” Kids are nuts about punishing themselves. And you had a fi ve-year-old running her mar-
riage. You had to be the most caring person in the whole world. So when the marriage didn’t
work, like when I asked my kids what should happen to you because you did this, I should not 
eat for a week. You had to make this enormous punishment for yourself.
ANGEL
Like I should not be happy for the rest of my life.
ERHARD
Precisely. Very good. I don’t want to see you cry any more about that. I want you to see how 
stupid that is, how patently, brutally stupid. How old are you?
ANGEL
Thirty-two.
ERHARD
How old were you when you fi rst got married?
ANGEL
Twenty-one.
ERHARD
How old were you when you got divorced fi rst?
ANGEL
Twenty-fi ve.
