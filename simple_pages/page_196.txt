SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
See, you got hurt, didn’t you, when you were growing up? 
ANDY 
Yeah.
KIPP
See how you said “yeah”? So today your job is to get present to your own life. And you gloss 
over it by saying you’re a sleaze. People aren’t interested in things, people are interested in you. 
We give people things, we don’t give them our selves. You’re a guy walking around with a chip 
on your shoulder, and the chip has become your life.
ANDY
Right.
ERHARD (coming forward)
Hold on, hold on a minute. A lot of people in here with a chip on their shoulder. How many 
people in here have a chip on their shoulder? I’m looking around here to see if the right hands 
are up. 
Erhard pointed out a couple of people to indicate that they needed to have their hands raised. He 
addressed one of them.
(continuing)
That costs you your beauty, you know that? You’re a beautiful woman. Nobody can see that 
with that fucking chip on your shoulder; takes your power away from you.
KIPP
Anything more?
ANDY
Just that it is so powerful.
KIPP
Right. The chip on your shoulder uses your life.
ANDY
Like a drug.
KIPP
Thank you.
(applause)
