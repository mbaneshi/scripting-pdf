Forum Day Three: Session One

JANE
Seven or eight years old.
ERHARD
You’ve got an eight-year-old running a seventeen-year-old’s life. You know that?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Is it true that nobody likes you?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
You are “nobody likes you,” even though you know that’s irrational. But it wasn’t irrational for a
eight-year-old, was it?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
If I told you a story like yours to a seventeen-year-old, you’d understand that makes sense for an
eight-year-old to think that, right?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
But would you understand that in a seventeen-year-old woman?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
No, it’s not the thinking of a seventeen-year-old woman, is it?
JANE
Right.
ERHARD
You want to know about yourself that you put your identity together, you put your persona
together. You built yourself. Your life will be a compensation for not being liked. And the way
But Heidegger quickly pulls us up short here: on second
thought (and it is in the pattern of Heidegger’s thinking that there
are many second thoughts for any proposal), are we really, in
awakening an attunement, letting it be? On the contrary, Heideg-
ger suggests that attunements function best as themselves when
they are not recognized as themselves. If, he asks,
t
“
we make an attunement conscious, come to know
of it and explicitly make the attunement itself into
an object of knowledge, we achieve the contrary
of an awakening. The attunement is thereby pre-
cisely destroyed, or at least not intensified, but
weakened and altered. (FCM 61)
M
Therefore, considering attunements as being asleep, and therefore
to be awakened—since it may destroy the very phenomenon to
which we wish to attend—may not be the best path for inquiry; so
Heidegger proposes another direction for our thinking:
“
How oft en it happens, in a conversation among
a group of people, that we are ‘not there,’ how
oft en we find that we were absent, albeit without
having fallen asleep. This not-being-there, this be-
ing-away [Weg-sein], has nothing at all to do with
consciousness in the usual sense. On the contrary,
this not-being-there can be highly conscious. In
such being absent we are precisely concerned
with ourselves, or with something else. Yet this
not-being-there is nonetheless a being-away.
(FCM 63)
M
A human being can only be away because its being has the charac-
y
ter of being-there. As being-there, “a human being—insofar as he
or she exists—is, in his or her being there, also always already and
necessarily away in some manner” (FCM 63):

SPEAKING BEING
to get to the possibility beyond that is to really see what happened when you were a seven- or
eight-year-old little girl, and you got held back. Look out there.
(indicating the group)
What do you see?
JANE
A lot of people staring at me.
ERHARD
You can’t see that. You can’t see “people.” You can see that person and that person and that
person. You can’t see people. “People” is a story. Look out there and see if you can see persons.
JANE
Yeah I see persons.
ERHARD
What are those persons doing?
JANE (looking)
Some are nodding. Mouths open.
ERHARD
Is there anybody out there not liking you?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
Just persons, right? Some of them may not like you. Because there are people “not liking
people” waiting to happen. And there are seven- and eight- year-olds like that, aren’t they? The
other thing: I want to know if you’re going to hide the rest of your life. You know you’re hiding?
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
You know you’re not expressing yourself?
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
That’s your racket, isn’t it?
“
. Being
away does not mean: not being at all. It is rather
a way of Da-sein’s being-there. The stone, in its
being away, is precisely not there. . . .  Only as long
as we are-there [da-sind] can we be away at all,
and vice-versa. Hence being away, or this ‘there
and not there,’ is something peculiar, and attune-
ment is connected in some as yet obscure way
with this peculiar manner of being. (FCM 64, 65)
M
An attunement, then, is not being asleep; nor is it being unconscious.
It is more akin to being away while there. But it is never not there,
which is the traditional perspective of moods and attunements,
as “feelings”—emotional events that come and go as a result of
circumstances (FCM 64).
M
We have so far discovered some things that an attunement is
not. “Therefore,” says Heidegger, “we must now ask: How are we
to grasp attunement positively as belonging to the essence of man,
and how are we to relate toward man himself if we wish to awaken
an attunement?” (FCM 65).
He beckons us to follow him by suggesting this example:
“
A human being we are with is overcome by grief. Is
it simply that this person has some state of lived
experience that we do not have, while everything
else remains as before? If not, what is happening
here? The person overcome by grief closes himself
off , becomes inaccessible, yet without showing any
animosity toward us; it is simply that he becomes
inaccessible. . . . Everything remains as before, and
yet everything is diff erent, not only in this or that
respect, but—irrespective of what we do and
t
what
we engage in—the way in which we are together is
y
diff erent. (FCM 66)
M
Heidegger is asking us to look closely at the situation. It is not that
I myself feel grief; but that the attunement of our being with one
another has shift ed.
Or consider someone who is always in a good humor and
“brings a lively atmosphere with them” (FCM 68); or “someone who
