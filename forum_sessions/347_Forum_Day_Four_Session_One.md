Forum Day Four: Session One

got, maybe, the terror there. And the terror was there. I couldn’t get out of it. I have a beautiful
concept of it. And I can tell you metaphors about it, but it was there. I got up this morning, and
it’s like... my son came in and he sits down on the bed. He said “Mom, tell me about this thing
you’re doing.” Before I tell you that, let me tell you a little bit about my son. He spent fi ve years
in a mental hospital. He’s thirteen now. And I said “Well, we’re talking about how we are as
human beings. And we’ve been talking about how we have these things that exist for us from
when we were really little, and he said “You mean those things we know from the time we
were born?” Shit.
(laughter)
So I say “Yeah.” So anyway, and we go on and we’re talking, and he’s following me, and I say
“Yeah, I’ve been looking at the way I am, and this thing I’ve got about being an incompetent
parent, and the terror I have with it. And he says, “Mom, you’re an incompetent parent,” and
then he laughed—
(she demonstrates the laughter)
“Mom, we’re related!”
(applause)
And I’m blown away, laughing and crying at the same time, really, and he’s standing there and
says “Mom, I don’t understand you’re laughing and crying, but don’t look, I’m crying.” It was
like... Later on in the morning he was sitting on the bed and terrorizing the cat. So I says “now
what would you do if somebody came in and was terrorizing the cat the way you’re terrorizing
the cat?” “Well I would shoot ’em.” And I said, “I just don’t know what to do about it.” And he
says “well you’re an incompetent parent!”
(laughter)
I said “I got it. If I were terrorizing the cat, what would you do?” And he said “I’d tell you to
stop it.” And I said “Well, stop terrorizing the cat.” And he did.
KIPP
A lot of work.
SARAH
Yeah.
KIPP
It’s been this drama. And this tragedy, and how to work it out, and what to do...
SARAH
“How do I do it to you to make you stop terrorizing the cat?”
KIPP
Yeah, building a strategy and looking for the options.
inauthenticity” (BT 312). Such a life may be easy, interesting, and
T
pleasant; but it is never one’s own.
And yet: since this is the only mode of existence we have
experienced, how could we know that any other mode is
available? What is needed is a hint, a prod, a direction: “In terms
of its possibility,” says Heidegger, “Dasein
y
is already a potentiality-
for-Being-its-Self, but it needs to have this possibility attested”
(BT 313, emphasis added). For this purpose, we are introduced
T
here to an old friend whom we have undoubtedly encountered
before:
[Because] Dasein is lost in the “they,” it must
first find itself. In order to find itself at all,
it must be ‘shown’ to itself in its possible
authenticity. . . .this potentiality [-for-Being-
its-Self] is attested by that which, in Dasein’s
everyday interpretation of itself, is familiar
to us as the “voice of conscience” [Stimme des
Gewissens]. (BT 313
T
)
“
But precisely because the conscience is such a familiar
element of our moral/psychological/theological mythology—one
that has been assessed, disputed, and interpreted in manifold
ways—it is likely to occur here as a tired concept reduced to
ambiguity in the idle talk of the “they.” So Heidegger emphasizes
that he is positing the voice of conscience as an existential
phenomenon. That is, like our attunements, which cannot be
ascertained without being inhabited, the voice of conscience
is there, waiting to happen, and so is only heard when Dasein,
attuned in anxiety, wants a conscience. Thus, it is never factual,
only factical.
As a phenomenon of Dasein, conscience is not
just a fact which occurs and is occasionally
present-at-hand. It ‘is’ only in Dasein’s kind of
Being, and makes itself known as a Fact only
with factical existence and in it. (BT 313

SPEAKING BEING
SARAH
Yeah, well that was it and it was like, it’s “I’m an incompetent parent.”
WES
Someone is willing to say what’s so, rather than give a reason for it or try to explain what it all
means, deal with the signifi cance of it...
SARAH
And it was real clear to him, “you’re still my mother. You’re my mother!” He said that! And
in all the discussing about The Forum with people in my life it never occurred to me to talk
to him.
WES
Yeah, it only occurred to you to talk to yourself.
SARAH
Oh, I love that one.
(laughter)
Yeah, he talked to me. He got up early to come talk to me. I left him—maybe I shouldn’t say
this—we were out of kitty litter. The cat pooped on the carpet and I told him to clean it up and
go buy more kitty litter. It’s not like I have to do it for him. Yeah.
(applause)
KIPP
Thank you Sarah.
WES  (to the group)
Your whole life has been lived inside of meanings, explanations, reasons, and justifi cations.
The lowest level in which human beings can live their life... I’m now going to give you a name
for that. You’re at a place where you can begin to recognize it. Before you were too much in it to
be able to recognize it. You know, like the fi sh cannot recognize water. The fi sh cannot discern
water; it’s everywhere. You’re like a fl ying fi sh, for the moment. You jumped out of the water,
and you looked back to see the water. And when you discern the water, you can take that back
into the water: That’s possible. It’s an analogy for what is occurring in the room: When you get
stuck with anything, it sheds a little light on it. So when you jump out of the water and you see
the water that human beings swim their life in, that water is called reasonableness.
(pausing)
The reasons for people are more important than the results in their life. Human beings care
more about reasons than they do about results. And when you ask people about what hap-
pened and why it happened and how come, you get drawn into a conversation for all your rea-
sons. People trade in reasons. They pretend to care about results, but all they really care about
The call is not something that occurs from time to time in such
a way that lends itself to inductive empirical study, for “the Fact
of conscience cannot present itself at all” (BT 314). Rather than
T
search for empirical instances, to encounter the call, to “hear”
it, requires before all else a transformation in the listener, a shift
from listening away to the “they” to a listening that is altogether
different.
Dasein fails to hear itself, and listens away
to the “they”; and this listening-away gets
broken by the call if that call, in accordance
with its character as such, arouses another
kind of hearing, which, in relationship to
the hearing that is lost, has a character in
every way opposite. If in this lost hearing,
one has been fascinated with the ‘hubbub’
of the manifold ambiguity which idle talk
possesses in its everyday “newness”, then the
call must do its calling without any hubbub
and unambiguously, leaving no foothold for
curiosity. That which, by calling in this manner,
gives us to understand, is the conscience.
(BT 316
T
)
“
First Dasein must find itself as having failed to hear
itself, which refers to the dominant self-reflexive trope of The
Forum: being authentic about one’s own inauthenticity, which
necessitates finding oneself to be inauthentic, that is, to be living
a life not one’s own, all the while pretending one is. This finding
of oneself as inauthentic is the lack that the conscience reveals,
the charge of “Guilty!” which the voice of conscience calls Dasein
to own up to. “To be” means to be falling, to have lost touch with
Being because Being loves to hide. We are left with words that
become dead, as mere transparent husks. But how can we get
those husks to come forward and speak Being? ■
