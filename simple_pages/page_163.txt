Horseshit! What do you mean really needed it? That’s all horseshit. They’re probably 10 times as 
tough as you are. Probably needed a lot less than you did. But...irrelevant. You think a fi ve-year-
old is sophisticated enough to deal with that kind of logic?
ANGEL
I tried.
ERHARD
Is a fi ve-year-old sophisticated enough to deal with that kind of logic? You know what a fi ve-
year-old girl looks like?
ANGEL
Yeah, I do, I saw home movies over Christmas. I know exactly what I looked like. 
ERHARD
A fi ve-year-old girl is pretty...not very worldly, huh? And also very caring, aren’t they?
ANGEL
Yes. But she told me I didn’t care.
ERHARD
Wait. We’re not back at fi ve now. We’re having a discussion up here for a moment and then we’ll
go back to fi ve. But I want you to look at a fi ve-year-old little girl and see that a fi ve-year-old girl 
cares very deeply, and is not up to the logic “you don’t care” because if you’d care you would 
know that these other children need more love and attention than you do. So you dealt with it
like a fi ve-year-old. What does a fi ve-year-old decide?
ANGEL
She was right.
ERHARD (raising voice)e
No! She decides she’s going to be the most caring person in the whole world!
ANGEL
Yes! Yes! Yes!
ERHARD
Like those magical bullshit fucking things that fi ve-year-old girls do, which is wonderful when 
you’re a fi ve-year-old girl. You know, you decide, “I’m going to be the most caring person in the
whole world! No one’s going to care more than me.”
