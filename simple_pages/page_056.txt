SPEAKING BEING
person who goes around pretending you’re going to do what you say you’ll do. Isn’t it true that 
you present yourself as someone who’ll do what you say you’ll do? But isn’t it true that maybe

PARTICIPANT

Isn’t it true that you present yourself as 
someone who’ll do what you say you’ll do? 
But isn’t it true that maybe you’ll do it and
maybe you won’t?
