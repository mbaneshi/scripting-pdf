Forum Day Four: Session Two

all that other stuff  to it. As a matter of fact, when you’re lost, you could discover something. But
when you’re lost and angry, you’re too busy being angry to fi nd out anything beyond being lost
and angry. Anything else?
DOREL
No. Thank you.
KIPP
Well done. Thank you very much.

Wait a second, Kipp. Just to complete this: You have to deal with your own listening to this
conversation. Consider the possibility that you are listening to the conversation about problems
like it would help you solve them. See that? It’s listening to this like “Oh, here’s new stuff  to help
me solve my problems.” That’s more of the same. This conversation is intended to create a new
clearing for problems, which clearing will alter you and the problems in life. That’s the intention.
If you were looking at Illiana’s face, she got a new clearing for this whole thing about attention.
She still needs attention. She still has a racket. Still has the same job. But the occurrence “atten-
tion” occurs in a new clearing. This clearing will give her the opportunity to make new requests.
See, she’s never tried out being straight with people about giving her attention. Like...
(to Illiana, who is sitting)
“Would you give me some attention? Let’s stop for fi ve minutes. I’m producing great results. I
want you to listen to what happened to me today. Would you be willing to do that?” The racket
is to do it and have a problem with doing it. Now you can just do it. By the way, this attention
thing has something else behind it.
(to the group)
The point is that there’s a possibility for you and your problems to relate diff erently. A new
clearing. You don’t have to remember any of this. No, there’s one thing you have to remember:
Your problems are part of your racket and your racket stinks. That’s all you need to remember.
That’ll create a new clearing for you.
At 3:30, Kipp asked participants to stand up and stretch and then sit back down.

When you come into life from empty and meaningless, and you’re able to be with your racket,
what opens up for you is choice. However, you don’t know anything about choice. So we’re
going to spend some time distinguishing choice as choice. So when you say you’re going to do
something and you want to do it, you say what? You go out and make a what? A decision, yes?
You say something like “I made a decision to do this.” First of all, we want to get choice and
decision distinct. The word “decide” comes from the same family as suicide, matricide, and
426
SPEAKING BEING
patricide and all the cides—meaning to kill. Decide means to kill or murder the alternative. So
when you decide something you are destroying the alternative. “I’ve decided to do that!” That’s
a decision—based on something. “I’m deciding this because...” It’s always based on something.
What gives a decision is it’s based on something. Choice is not based on something. It’s based
on no thing or nothing. Choice is to select freely and after consideration, not limited by what-
ever the evidence that you have to give for a decision. The fi rst thing we need to do is to get
a decision to be a decision and a choice to be a choice so that they can live distinctly for you.
When you say choose, what you mean for the most part is decide. What you’re actually saying
is decide. We’re going to do a little demonstration with someone to distinguish a choice from a
decision, so you can see it clearly for yourself, so you can see a choice in action.
Kipp asked for a volunteer who has not taken The Forum before, nor seen the demonstration. The
participant chosen was Bill, the young man who had interacted so combatively with Erhard during
Session One of Day One of The Forum.
KIPP (continuing)
Are you willing to do this demonstration, to stay with it all the way through, keep participating,
even if it looks like it might be frustrating for you and you might not get it, and go right to the
end and keep on playing?
BILL (smiling)
Couldn’t look any worse than I did on the fi rst day. So yeah, I’m willing.
KIPP
That’s true.
(laughter: to the group)
Okay, so. All right. Now, your job is not to coach Bill. A lot of the time when you are sitting in
your chair and you don’t have whatever it is that you have when you’re standing there attempt-
ing to get it sorted out for yourself, where it’s sometimes a little more diffi  cult to see, so don’t
say it out loud, or coach him in some way. Let him struggle with it because it’s the inquiry into
the distinction, the struggle that will bring forth the distinction. We’re not defi ning a distinc-
tion; we’re not explaining a distinction. We’re not describing choice. We want to see choice as a
distinction in action. So Bill, I’m going to ask you to make a simple choice, and each time I ask
you to make a choice, you’ll say to me, “I choose...” whatever you chose, “because...” And you’ll
fi ll in whatever comes after that for you, okay? You clear how to respond? Okay ready?
BILL
Yeah.
Kipp held out two hands as if he had an ice cream cone in each one.
