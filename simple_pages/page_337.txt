ERHARD
Okay good. Raphaela?
RAPHAELA
That’s my story, when we went through the fear process: I found myself angry because all these 
people were acting the way they were and then I saw that I was going through this process of I 
couldn’t be whatever it was I was going to be because I was angry with these people for making 
these really fucking weird noises. Distracting me: “Come on, shut up and let me be who I am,” 
you know.

ERHARD
Why are they laughing? Do you know?
RAPHAELA
It’s really silly. 
ERHARD
And also there’s a certain recognition. People laugh when they recognize themselves in other 
people. Like when you said the king has no clothes, everybody laughed, right? Because they 
saw it all along but nobody had said it.
RAPHAELA
So right now I’m working on trying to understand the not having meaning in my life, because for 
so long it’s been “there has to be a meaning,” “there has to be a purpose,” you know, you do things 
in-order-to. And it’s really hard for me to get off  that because, my story is that’s what my parents 
have taught me. And the real truth is that they raised me, they fed me, and they loved me, but I 
get...

The truth is you’re a human being, and that’s what you get with being human. That’s what 
you get when you get here and the party’s over. You get the kind of being that gives everything 
meaning. And what you’re doing is thrashing around inside the trap. Flailing around. Well if it 
doesn’t mean anything, what does that mean? 
RAPHAELA
Well, I now say... I hear that it doesn’t mean anything, so how do I get out of that trap, which is 
a trap in itself?
At 9:45, Wes entered and joined Kipp in this interaction.
