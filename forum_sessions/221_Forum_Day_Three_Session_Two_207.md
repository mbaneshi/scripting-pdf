Forum Day Three: Session Two 207
PARTICIPANT (a teenage boy)
I’ve always been cracking jokes, always had to have something to say, and now what I’m looking
at... is... it’s all an act.
PARTICIPANT
I could only get in touch with a little fear.

This is not about liberation. You should experience that suppression. Whatever you experience
is fi ne, really. Just continue to listen to the conversation in the room. And if you continue to
listen to the conversation in the room, it will continue to open up for you—what’s going on
with you. We’re a long way until the end of The Forum. Be here, now, in this conversation. The
Forum is too simple for complicated minds. The conversation going on in the room is more
powerful than your internal dialogue.

This is the fi rst time I really saw how scared to death I am of people in authority. My father
died when I was four years old, and my mother was a very strong and powerful woman. That’s
the bitch I can never get away from. If we did not do what she asked us to do, she would tie us
up and beat us with a stick, or with words. I saw that I can never be myself around people in
authority, because I am always afraid of being beaten or yelled at. And so I turn into a weasel
around authority and I can’t make straight requests, because when I asked my mother, I knew
it wouldn’t be accepted. And I couldn’t say no to her, ever. None of us could, there were three
of us. And the other side of it, that being able to see, really, that she was scared to death of me,
that she was scared to death that I would not do what she asked if she didn’t use force. Later on,
when you spoke about compassion, and I felt such deep compassion for all people in authority
who use force, because they’re really scared that if they don’t use force, you won’t do what they
are asking you to do. I’m standing in this huge possibility of really being with people who use
force and really being there and really acknowledging my terror of forty-nine years of stuff  has
disappeared.

Thank you.
Wes announced a break. The assignment for the break: get a partner and complete your experience
of the exercise.
The Forum adjourned for a break at 4:00 pm.
fear in anxiety is “really nothing”; in saying this, the concept of
nothing has been reached. But what gives an experience of anxiety
its potential for self-revelation is that in such a state of mind we
reach nothing ontologically. And in this deeply experienced loss of
worldly significance there occurs, simultaneously, the possibility
of the clearing, the pure Being-openness which is Dasein. As
anxiety, the experience is unsettling; beneath and beyond lies the
possibility. But do not build up too much hope.
In the Danger Process, we can observe a clear instance of what
appears to be a symbiotic relationship between Erhard’s work and the
thinking of Martin Heidegger. This process was a central element of
the est Training from its inception, and consistently provided one of its
most dramatic components. But in The Forum, when that process is
placed within the framework of Heidegger’s model of Dasein, it gains
a new and empowering context; while at the same time, the in-the-
world power of Heidegger’s model is illuminated.
We note, however, that despite this aff inity between the
evocative aims of the two thinkers, on our view it would be
inaccurate to say that The Forum evokes an experience of anxiety
in participants. That term has denotative power in its use by
Heidegger, suggesting the aff ective extremity of the path to
ontological liberation. But the languaging of The Forum employs its
own vocabulary of hints, thereby providing an alternate ontological
path—equally extreme, but without the inevitable psychological
implications that currently accompany the concept of anxiety.
We assert that what distinguishes the transformation of
Erhard’s work from the majority of personal empowerment
programs—those that, in Erhard’s words, help people become
“more, better, or diff erent”—is its evocation of the Nothing. An
authentic experience of Being, said Heidegger, must begin by
doing violence to the “tranquillized obviousness” of the everyday
interpretation. Therefore The Forum works backward before it
moves forward; this is the heart of its genius. ■

SPEAKING BEING
meta ta phusika, which indicates a realm over beyond what naturally is. In the
metaphysical understanding of things that has developed in the West, Being has
been severed from its original relationship with beings, and has been relegated to
the over beyond, a loft y transcendental realm to which access is mysterious and, for
contemporary thinking, no longer even desirable. For the most part, human beings
are unaware that anything is missing. For us, says Heidegger, the “word ‘Being’ is
then finally just an empty word. It means nothing actual, tangible, real. Its meaning
is an unreal vapor” (IM 39–40).
From the inception of his work, Werner Erhard has engaged the public by
calling attention to this absence of Being, as in this 1982 presentation that he
delivered to some 20,000 people in audiences in nine cities:
“
and reality. I say that you and I live inside that gap, that there’s
a chasm, a gap, between what you and I expect of life and what
life really is. . . . I’m not talking about the gap between your
dreams and reality. I’m talking about the gap between what you
and I have a right to expect from life, and what we actually get
from life. See, you and I have a right to expect our relationships
to be deeply nurturing and really fulfilling, and for the most
part they’re not. . . . You and I have a right, when we go to work
for an organization, when we move from an individual expres-
sion to an organizational expression, we have a right to expect
our aff iliation with that organization to empower us, to make an
even bigger contribution than we could do as an individual. . . .
You know, we’ve got a right to expect certain things from the
government, and we don’t get it. Not fantasies. We have a right
to expect certain things from the practice of our religion, and
for the most part people don’t get it—what they have a right
to expect. And it’s all over the place. There is a gap. And it’s a
no-kidding gap. Something is missing. . . . And what [we—as the
they-self—are] providing is not allowing it to show up. (“Taking
a Stand for the Future”)
In responding to Being’s departure, both Heidegger and Erhard have focused their
eff orts on the design of a new language. Heidegger’s most frequently quoted claim
is that language is the house of Being (“LH” in BW 217). “In the word, in language,”
he said, “things first come to be and are” (IM 15). That is, the language of one’s time
SESSION TWO INTERVAL
The Forge tting of Being, Part Four of Eight: The Pre-Socratics
Martin Heidegger’s purpose as a philosopher was to think a way back to the
greatness which was promised at the beginning of Western history, but which has
remained unrealized due to the metaphysical tradition that has dominated human
understanding.
Historically, the term metaphysics has referred to the branch of philosophy that
dealt with questions about the nature of things, about ultimate causes and that
which does not change—questions, that is, about the nature of Being. This area
of philosophical inquiry is now generally designated as ontology. In the normal
course of events, most people, aside from academics and theologians, give little
or no thought to the subjects of metaphysics and ontology, or even to Being. But
Heidegger proposes that whether or not we are aware of it, the metaphysical
tradition is deeply embedded in the way we understand the world. In our everyday
lives, he says, this metaphysical understanding constrains our ability to be.
We remind the reader again as we begin this Interval that we are engaged in
an inquiry into something that is not something—that is, it does not fall within
the range of phenomena that are readily available for us to think about. In his
writing, Heidegger was persistent in his eff orts to indicate this mysterious aspect;
for example, in the text of one of his later books (The Event) the word “Being” was
repeatedly printed with a strikethrough. Here, the authors suggest that whenever
the word “Being” (in its capitalized form) occurs in our writing, it might usefully be
thought of as accompanied by a parenthetical question mark.
From the beginning of his career, Martin Heidegger’s work as a philosopher
was driven by the question of the human relationship to this mystery. According
to Hubert Dreyfus, a scholar with whom Werner Erhard consulted while creating
The Forum, Heidegger at some point had an experience of Being similar to the one
elicited by Erhard’s work, and he “struggled all his life to find an adequate language
to express it without falling, as he put it, into the ruts of metaphysics” (Assessment 2).
Over the years, his articulation of the being/Being relationship evolved significantly,
but his single-minded commitment to the question never wavered. At the heart
of the inquiry was his sense that modern human beings are out of touch with this
aspect of existence. It is as if, as Western culture has developed, Being has fled,
and a critical element of human experience has been lost.
The “ruts of metaphysics” mark the road Western thinking has traveled during
the millennia since the time of Plato. The word itself is derived from the Greek
