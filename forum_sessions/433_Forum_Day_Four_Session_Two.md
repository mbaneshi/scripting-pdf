Forum Day Four: Session Two

WES
Right: With this person and with that person...
ILLAINA
Yes.
WES
“I want attention from him but he’s not giving me any attention,” and so you develop a whole
story about what kind of person he is, and she’s had this problem before with other people, and
none of it should be, it’s all wrong and she’s less-than, and you’re into this whole crummy story
and somebody’s wrong. And somebody’s right. Of course she’s right and something else is wrong.
ILLIANA
From that I developed asking attention in diff erent ways.
WES
Right: as a solution. But they never really work, do they?
ILLIANA
No. Until today. I don’t get what I want.
WES
Yeah.
ILLIANA
Now, you said to bring up the problem, okay? The problem that I came up with was... I’m deal-
ing now in my life with a... working with a new company, trying to do something that I don’t
believe I can do. And what I really want is their attention, to know that I can do it.
WES
Yeah, and that’ll make everything lousy, with no satisfaction. She’s doing it to get attention, not to
produce results. There will be no accomplishment, and she’ll never get enough attention, so she’ll
be driven, and it’s a racket. And she’ll also conclude about it that it shouldn’t be. The whole situation
“shouldn’t be,” and you shouldn’t be this way. However it turns out, “it shouldn’t be.” And you’ll have
a problem again, and that shouldn’t be. And so now you can stand in empty and meaningless and see
the absurdity of that. The absurdity of the problem called “needing attention.” You want attention?
ILLIANA
Yeah.
WES
Great. Take what you get and call that “attention.” That would be a possibility, right? From
empty and meaningless?
Fact One
Our actions from moment to moment are generally consistent with
t
our way of being in those moments.  This is true for any way of be-
ing, such as annoyed, or sad, or loving, and the like.  For example,
when we are being angry we are also likely to find ourselves acting
angrily, and when we are being confident we are likely to be acting
confidently.  It is clear that when we are being angry, or confident,
or annoyed, or sad or loving, our actions are likely to be consistent
with that way of being.
Note that we have said that our actions are virtually always
consistent with our
t
way of being (what is going on with us inter-
nally).  And that is all that can be verified in our experience (in our
consciousness).  We can have theories about some additional con-
nection or relation between our way of being and our actions, but
there is no proof (evidence) of any further connection or relation
between our way of being and our way of acting other than that
they are consistent with each other.
t
However, we must note that most people go through life and
act in life as though what is going on with them internally (some
combination of their mental state, emotional state, bodily state,
and their thoughts and memories) causes their actions.  But there
is no scientific evidence for believing in such a causal connection.
All we can say about the relationship between our way of being
and acting is that they are mutually arising or co-arising.  In fact,
during the course we will present neuroscience research (Clancey
1993; Libet 1999; Hawkins 2004; Soon 2008; Haggard 2009; Kandel
2009; Bode 2011; Wolpert 2011; Zimmer 2013 and Buckner 2013)
that is contrary to the belief that what is going on with you inter-
nally causes your actions.  For now, the following quotes from
neuroscientist Sam Harris (2012) summarize in everyday lan-
guage the research about the connection between what is going
on with you internally (in this case, your decision or intention) and
y
your action:

SPEAKING BEING
ILLIANA
You mean, whatever comes?
WES
Yeah. Take what you get and call that “attention.” Someone looks over at me, “great. That’s
attention.” And then get along with my work. Not like “They didn’t look long enough. That
must mean I’m not okay.” Swirling around in your racket. Who cares if you didn’t get attention?
Produce some results. And then you’ll die.
(laughter)r
ILLIANA
I want to ask a question. I would like to fi t my racket with what you are saying.
WES
Where is the “unfi t”?
(after Illiana asks Wes to read the board once more)
“I want to go the beach, but I don’t have any time.” That’s a problem.
ILLIANA
So that’s the “but”: “I want to get attention, but I don’t want to ask for it.”
WES
Great. That’s a problem, right?
ILLIANA
Right.
WES
Let’s shift it: It’s a lie. It’s a racket.
ILLAINA
Okay.
WES
Tell the truth about it. “I want to get attention and I’m afraid to ask for it.”
ILLIANA (smiling)
And I’m afraid to ask for it. So the “but” is creating the problem.
Some moments before you are aware of what
you will do next—a time in which you subjec-
tively appear to have complete freedom to
behave however you please—your brain has
already determined what you will do.  You
then become conscious of this “decision” and
believe that you are in the process of making
it. (9)
The intention to do one thing and not another
does not originate in consciousness—rather, it
appears in consciousness. . . . (8)

Fact Two
And, perhaps even less obvious is that both our way of being and
our actions (arising together consistent with each other) is correlat-
ed with—is naturally, necessarily, closely connected with; or more
d
poetically, in-a-dance-with—the way in which what we are dealing
with occurs or shows up for us.  In short, our way of being and act-
ing is a natural correlate of (in-a-dance-with) the way what we are
dealing with occurs for us.  For example, if the way a situation we
are dealing with occurs or shows up for us as threatening, our way
of being and acting is likely to be a natural correlate of (in-a-dance-
with) the situation occurring or showing up for us as threatening.
On the other hand, if the way a situation we are dealing with occurs
or shows up for us as an opportunity to excel, our way of being and
acting is likely to be correlated with the situation
d
occurring for us
as an opportunity to excel.
In summary, our actions are merely consistent with our
t
way of
being—that is, our actions are likely consistent with some combi-
nation of our mental state, emotional state, bodily state, and our
thoughts and memories; but our actions are not caused by these
d
aspects of what is going on with us internally.
