WES
No it’s more like “I shouldn’t have the problem ‘weight.’”
DONALD
I shouldn’t have the problem “weight,” I should be more like Ron.
(indicating person sitting next to him who looks more fi t than Donald)
WES
No.
(laughter)r
That you have problems, is wrong. You’d be better off  without your problems, right Donald?
DONALD
Yeah. 
WES
That’s what we’re dealing with.
DONALD
Oh, I’ve got it.
WES
You wouldn’t be better off  without your problems, because if have life, you’ll have problems. 
DONALD
I got it.
WES
The whole group “problems” has opened up. We haven’t dealt with the specifi c problem called

DONALD
I got it.
WES
You can stand with your problems like “acceptance,” or even more than acceptance.
DONALD
Recognition.
