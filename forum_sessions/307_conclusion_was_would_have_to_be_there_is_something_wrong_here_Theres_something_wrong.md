conclusion was, would have to be, “there is something wrong here!” There’s something wrong
innately, profoundly, deeply, at the foundation, there’s something wrong! Life is constituted—
you don’t think in these terms, but—life is constituted as something wrong. Something’s wrong!
And you don’t make that decision. You are that there’s something wrong. Now, you don’t get
that yet; you’re not supposed to get that yet. You’re supposed to follow what I’m saying.
(posturing as the voice in a participant’s “head”)
“Gee, I don’t know. I don’t think that I’m ‘that there’s something wrong.’ I see what you’re saying
Werner, I see that it’s logical that I would have to have come to that conclusion in my childhood,
like a way of being. But gee I don’t get that ‘there’s something wrong.’ I mean, I actually think
there’s a lot of right things. I mean, I don’t live my life out of ‘there’s something wrong.’”
(returning to his own voice)
That’s what you should be saying to yourself, unless it’s already obvious to you that who you are
is that there’s something wrong. For most of you that won’t be obvious yet. What I said will be
obvious: that there is in your childhood and in your early childhood the circumstances in which
you as a child would have to come to the inevitable conclusion that there is something wrong
in life. That part I know you can see. The part you can’t see yet is how to fi t that into today. So
we’re going to fi t that into today for you now. Jane, so, what I said made sense? Like you decided
there was something wrong?
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
You answered the question I asked: Did it make sense?
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
You got any recollection of having made that kind of decision?
One is the way oneself, since until one advances there is no way.
This perspective of his own work emerged early on in
Heidegger’s career as a professor of philosophy. Here he describes
his development of this perspective, as it occurred for him during a
course he taught early in his career:
“
. . . the course was most imperfect. Yet there
was quickening in it the attempt to walk a path
of which I did not know where it would lead.
I knew only the most immediate short-range
perspectives along that path, because they
beckoned to me unceasingly, while the horizon
shift ed and darkened more than once.

This is the first of three points that we want to stress here about
Heidegger’s way: that in entering upon the way to Being, one
is jumping off  into the unknown. This is necessary because the
thinking of Being cannot be understood in advance of its being
thought. Therefore its undertaking is necessarily an advance into
what is not known. But it is important to note that this advance
into the unknown is not simply thinking about some thought
content which we do not yet understand, something that we
know we don’t know. That would be equivalent to examining new
territory using a map; but Heidegger has no map. Werner Erhard
has made this point about his own work: in such thinking, we are
not merely traveling in uncharted waters, but in water that does
not always act like water (“Heart of the Matter”).
This is an important point for Heidegger: to be on the
way we must free ourselves from our subservience to the
“common comprehension,” which is “convinced it was born
comprehending everything” (WCT 77). We must give up judging
each new thought on the basis of whether it is consistent with
our old thoughts, a tendency which is pernicious in our current
mode of thinking.

JANE
No, I don’t.
ERHARD
Okay, thank you. You can sit down now if you want.
(applause as Jane sits)
ERHARD
You became that there’s something wrong. The question is: What did you do about it? The
answer is that from there on out, everything you did, everything you are, most particularly what
you’re really good at, was a response to, a way of dealing with, that there’s something wrong!
Your best moments, what you’re best at, what you’re most confi dent at, the best things in your
life... You got married—listen up!—you got married because there’s something wrong. It was
a way to deal with that there’s something wrong. No shit. I didn’t say your marriage wasn’t
wonderful. Your marriage may be the greatest thing that ever happened, but you got married
because there’s something wrong.  You had kids because there’s something wrong. You chose
your profession because there’s something wrong. You live your life because there’s something
wrong. And you developed the answers—that you got to what to do about the fact that there’s
something wrong—to a very high level. You’re really good at a lot of things, aren’t you? Really!
There are things you are really good at. The things you’re really good at—listen up. I know you
don’t get it yet—the things you’re really good at started out, had their genesis, are at the source a
way of dealing with that there’s something wrong. Here’s the evidence for my assertion: nothing
satisfi es you. Nothing satisfi es you. The things that you’re good at don’t satisfy, don’t nurture
you, don’t fulfi ll you, don’t leave you full of joy. They gratify you, because they make up for the
fact that something’s wrong. But they don’t fulfi ll you, don’t leave you full of joy, don’t leave you
fulfi lled. They don’t leave you complete. Did you ever notice, you’re never complete? Never. No
matter what you accomplish. No matter what you build, no matter what you create, no matter
what pleasure or accomplishment or satisfaction there is in your life, it’s never enough.
(Erhard moves around the room, speaking very loudly and forcefully)
And it’s never enough because you’re never going to be anything enough. You see, this is the
other side of the coin. We were talking about the bad stuff  before. I’m talking about the good
stuff . I’m talking about the good stuff  in your life: you know, your marriage, your romance,
your love aff air, the job that you’re very good at, that you’ve really developed your real skills in.
The stuff  in life that people can really count on you for. Your contributions to other people, the
diff erence you’ve made in life: that’s also only in the service of making up for the fact that you
are that there’s something wrong. The evidence for that assertion is that even the things that
you’re the best at, even the things that are the fi nest part of you, like your contributions to other
people, like the diff erence you’ve made for other people, like the sacrifi ces you’ve made for the
benefi t of other people—you know, you raised children all your life and you’ve done a great job
at it, and it’s still fucking not enough. You know you gave, gave, gave, and after a while you stop
giving, because it’s not enough to make up for “there’s something wrong here.” Yeah. Nothing.
Nothing. Nothing’s good enough for you, because nothing is for being good enough. Nothing is
Clearly, in a thinking that requires our familiar way of
thinking to be put under the possibility of deconstruction or
erasure, one is inherently at risk. This point was made repeatedly
by Heidegger, and is central to the rhetorical strategy of Werner
Erhard. The identity, the subject, the cogito, which is presently
dominating the clearing and thus confounding the appearing of
Being, does not want to be displaced. In clearing our “there,” in
unconcealing the clearing, we render our subjectivity homeless:
this is essential, since in our being “put out of the home in this
way, the home first discloses itself as such.” Thus the event of
unconcealment is also “the happening through which human
beings become homeless” (IM 186). Always on the way, we have
no home. No wonder we resist.
In Being and Time, in a passage which Erhard has quoted,
Heidegger states that any attempt to analyze Being “constantly
has the character of doing violence, whether to the claims of the
everyday interpretation, or to its complacency and its tranquilized
obviousness” (BT 359; quoted in “Heart of the Matter”). Heidegger
has further expressed this violent characteristic by describing the
opening for Being, not as a sylvan and tranquil clearing, but as the
turbulent battleground of a breach: “Historical humanity’s Being-
here means: Being-posited as the breach into which the excessive
violence of Being breaks in its appearing, so that this breach itself
shatters against Being” (IM 181). The sense of “historical” here
is not that of mere facts and trivia; rather, it has to do with the
making of history that occurs in moments when the way in which a
human being understands itself transforms, leaps from identifying
with what Erhard has termed the “story” to Being-in-the-world as
a new possibility for Being. Any transformation threatens what is
already there—held in place as it is by the “they” self who seeks to
reduce, or level down, Being to accommodate the averageness of
the everyday.
Thus, this fundamentally threatening nature of
unconcealment produces in Dasein what Heidegger calls the “will
to conquer that at the same time shrinks back” (IM 196). The task
at hand is forbidding: to be on the way, Dasein must engage in a
violent struggle to wrest Being from unconcealment, and in the
struggle must risk itself essentially. “Here,” writes Heidegger,
