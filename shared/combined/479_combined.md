Forum Day Four: Session Three 465
enough responsibility, and somebody’ll try to get close to me, and I’ll sit down. I’ll go on strike,
I’ll dare them to do whatever...
(breaking out into extended laughter)
A lot of people I’ve worked with—I’ve not allowed them to support me. I never realized that I
was just being my act about it. It never dawned on me that it was about being black and being
right. How it occurred for me is that they didn’t really care about me; that they were out for
their stuff . It wasn’t just who they are and who I am playing a game together. If I allowed in
what this work does for people; that would destroy my racket.
KIPP
And it would allow them to get the most out of you.
(laughter)
TRUMAN
Get the most out of me?
KIPP
Yeah. If this work gets the most out of people, it’ll get the most out of you.
TRUMAN (laughing)
Right, and I’m not interested in that.
(laughter)
I was sitting here. It was so funny. You were saying “Chocolate, choose.” And then it got funnier
when I was thinking “Chocolate chip, choose.”
(laughter)
KIPP
You all understand that all people are doing is sharing? All that’s happening is that people are
sharing. And you’re so excited; you’re peeing in your pants here. This is really more than you
ever bargained for in life. You never thought you could be a big enough person so that you could
hear people and let people this deeply into your lives. Thank you.
DARRELL
My whole act has been kind of being afraid of people, and then when I realized I got into the
conversation and saw that everybody is about as afraid of me as I am of them—that was a
bright light for me. I’ve been Mr. Aloof, sitting back like I know it all, and just wouldn’t talk to
anybody. I’ll just sit here looking like I’m in deep thought with myself and everyone will leave
me alone.
466
SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
And you are in deep thought with yourself.
DARRELL
But what does it mean? It doesn’t mean anything.
KIPP
Right.
DARRELL
In these four days I’ve been talking about myself to people I don’t even know. It was useful. It
feels good. I feel that I don’t have to go around with this act. I don’t have to keep myself separate
because I’m afraid people will fi nd out who I really am. I’m happy with that. Thank you!
(applause)
KIPP
Well done. Thank you!
HARRIET
I’m feeling tremendous energy that it is to choose to take the microphone and to be willing to
engage in the conversation, and not know anything about being right, and what the in-order-to
is. Just feeling the energy of the danger and the danger of the energy be used by power and all
that. Now I feel stupid.
KIPP
Now you’re just here.
HARRIET
I’m just here. And I’ve been afraid to engage in conversation, wanting to be right in the
conversation, wanting to be reasonable, wanting to wait for just the right moment to share the
right thing.
KIPP
It’s a very big one, that business of waiting for the right moment, the right thing, the right way
to do it, that’s a killer.
HARRIET
It has a lot to do with signifi cance. I have to make everything extremely signifi cant and
extremely important.
KIPP
Everything has to be extremely signifi cant and extremely important?
Forum Day Four: Session Three 467
HARRIET
Yeah. Really carrying it to absurd degrees.
KIPP
Like what?
HARRIET
For example, Thursday, I parked my car, got out of my car: I stepped in shit, literal shit.
(laughter)
“What does this mean?” And I started thinking that I wasn’t in harmony with the universe, or I
wouldn’t have stepped in shit. So I wipe it off .
KIPP (to laughter)
That is so great! You step in shit: You’re out of harmony with the universe...
HARRIET
Ah, but wait! But then yesterday when Werner was talking about stepping in dogshit I thought,
“Wow! I’m really doing it right.”
KIPP (to laughter)
Wow! You’re on the leading edge of shit! Nothing could ever just happen!
HARRIET (laughing)
That’s my life!
KIPP
Stepping in shit and having it be in harmony with the universe. Anything else Harriet?
HARRIET
I choose whatever is in front of me.
KIPP (to laughter)
Or underneath you.
HARRIET
Yup! And I’m still making it real signifi cant.
KIPP
That’s right. It all can be signifi cant as hell.
HARRIET
Right. Yeah.
468
SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
Well done. Thank you very much!
KAREN
On my way down from Washington to do The Forum, the bus driver had heard of this work
and he suggested to me that it was brainwashing and I shouldn’t do it. The fi rst day, I had that
thought just a bit. I mean, brainwashing does happen.
KIPP
Yes. Rub a dub dub.
(laughter)
KAREN (becoming moved as she speaks)
Then I listened to the sharing, and I saw that if the work can call forth this kind of authenticity,
and recognize that authenticity, then it’s got to be authentic. And it’s got to all be authentic. All
of it. I want all of you who have stood up to share to get that it’s been such a huge contribution
to see people having that kind of courage and willingness to step out and it really is profoundly
moving to see people come up against pain and grief and fear and push through when they
never thought they could, it’s extraordinary, and people are magnifi cent. I came to America to
have adventures, and love and joy were not two things that were especially present in my life
before coming here, and that’s what I got here.
KIPP
Thank you.
(applause)
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 13)
I’ve been participating in this work since 1975—that’s about half my life—and this is the greatest
thing I ever did... the fi rst minute I was in the original program I knew I’d never seen anything
like this, and I knew I’d be around this for a long, long time, and through the fourteen or fi fteen
years that I’ve been participating, I’ve seen a lot of people get to that kind of moment where they
lost touch with life or, sometimes we call it an incident, I’ve seen probably a hundred thousand
people get to what it was for them, and I’ve never ever had a sense of what mine was, until today. I
fi gured there was something wrong with me, after fourteen years you’d fi gure it would pass by, but
it never came up, and I’d like to share it if I could. When people stand up and share about having
a horrible childhood, and having these terrible things happen to them, I didn’t have anything like
that. I had the greatest childhood in the world, the greatest parents, they told me they loved me all
the time, they sent me to the best schools. When I was about four years old, I was in the fi rst grade
because I could read and write, I was a really smart little kid, and I got great grades, I got on the
honor roll all the time, and I got merit badges and merit pins, and awards, and I didn’t even know
half the time what they were giving them to me for. It wasn’t like I was working hard, or like I
Forum Day Four: Session Three 469
did anything, I just went to school and I loved God and I did what my parents told me to do, and
it worked. It was kind of like that for a few years. I remember starting third grade, and the fi rst
day—and I always sat in the front row, I loved to participate—the teacher kept asking all these
questions and I kept raising my hand, participating and answering the questions and was giving
all the right answers, and the teacher said “You are going to be my best student.” She went on
and asked another question, and I gave my answer and I got it wrong. And she looked at me and
said “That was really stupid.” And that was it! That was it! I just said “Okay! Fine! We’ll do it your
way” and it’s been that way ever since. And the funny thing is, I really got that’s defi nitely the
point at which I started to withdraw. It started to become about me. Up to that point there wasn’t
me, there was just participating and I felt like life was a privilege all the time...
KIPP
There’s something in there, a bit clouded. You might not have seen it. Up until that point there
was just participation. Not me. When you’re really participating, you’re not even there. You
know, when you’re really dancing, or really cooking, or really involved in something in life that
you love—that’s happening, not you.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 13)
So when she said “You’re going to be my best student,” or whatever the hell she said to me, well
I had never thought about that, I never thought that there was a best or a worst or anything like
that. I started thinking, “Well, I’m going to be the best!” And the next stupid thing out of my
mouth was the exact wrong thing to say, and I decided that...
KIPP
The next stupid thing out of your mouth was the next thing out of your mouth.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 13, laughing)
I don’t even remember what it was, and when I got in touch with it today, I was like, “ahh yeah!
I fi nally got my incident!” And it made absolutely no diff erence to know what it was. None!
KIPP (to applause)
Thank you very much. You know, there’s a story in science called evolution. In that story,
sometime, a long time ago, there was a little bit of something that became life in the water. It
started to evolve over eons of time. And then in a moment, a fi sh walked out of the water onto
land. That’s no longer evolution. It’s the evolution of evolution. That’s transformation. What
the past four days have been about was providing you a clearing to walk out on the land. And
the truth is you are not equipped for the land. What the seminars are about is equipping you to
create a new possibility of growth and learning and extraordinary results on the land. And if
you apply the rules of the water to see if you’re going to be in a seminar or not, they’re not going
to work. I invite you to choose to be in a seminar. Don’t concern yourself with which seminar
to be in. If the seminar reserved for you works, do that. If that night doesn’t work, pick another
one. Some of you are saying, fi rst I’ve got to digest The Forum. I invite you to consider what
you digest turns into. You are invited to participate. And you have the right to decline... ...When

روز چهارم انجمن: جلسه سه 465
مسئولیت کافی ، و کسی سعی خواهد کرد به من نزدیک شود ، و من می نشینم. من اعتصاب خواهم کرد ،
من به آنها جرات می کنم هر کاری را انجام دهند ... (شکستن خنده طولانی)
بسیاری از افرادی که من با آنها کار کرده ام - به آنها اجازه داده ام از من حمایت کنند. من هرگز نفهمیدم که من
فقط عمل من در مورد آن بود. هرگز بر من طلوع نکرد که این در مورد سیاه بودن و بودن است
درست چگونگی وقوع این مسئله این است که آنها واقعاً به من اهمیتی نمی دادند. که آنها برای
چیزهای آنها این فقط آنها نیستند و من با هم چه کسی بازی می کنم. اگر اجازه دادم
آنچه این کار برای مردم انجام می دهد ؛ این راکت من را نابود می کند. کله
و این به آنها اجازه می دهد تا از شما بیشترین بهره را ببرند. (خنده)
ترمن
بیشترین استفاده را از من؟ کله
بله اگر این کار بیشترین استفاده را از مردم داشته باشد ، بیشترین استفاده را از شما خواهد داشت. ترومن (خنده)
درست است ، و من به آن علاقه ای ندارم. (خنده)
من اینجا نشسته بودم خیلی خنده دار بود شما می گفتید "شکلات ، انتخاب کنید." و سپس خنده دار تر شد
وقتی فکر می کردم "تراشه شکلات ، انتخاب کنید."
(خنده)
کله
همه شما می فهمید که همه مردم انجام می دهند به اشتراک می گذارند؟ تمام آنچه اتفاق می افتد این است که مردم هستند
به اشتراک گذاری و شما بسیار هیجان زده هستید شما در اینجا شلوار خود را نگاه می کنید. این واقعاً بیشتر از شما است
همیشه در زندگی چانه زنی شده است. شما هرگز فکر نمی کردید که می توانید یک فرد به اندازه کافی بزرگ باشید تا بتوانید
مردم را بشنوید و به مردم اجازه دهید این موضوع را عمیقاً در زندگی خود قرار دهید. ممنون دارل
تمام عمل من به نوعی ترس از مردم بوده است ، و بعد وقتی فهمیدم وارد کشور شدم
مکالمه و دیدم که همه به همان اندازه که من از من می ترسند از من ترسیده اند -
چراغ روشن برای من. من آقای آلوف بوده ام ، مثل اینکه همه آن را می شناسم ، و فقط با آنها صحبت نمی کنم
هر کسی من فقط در اینجا می نشینم و به نظر می رسد که با خودم در فکر عمیق هستم و همه را ترک می کنند
من تنها 466
وجود
کله
و با خودتان در فکر عمیق هستید. دارل
اما معنی آن چیست؟ این به معنای چیزی نیست. کله
درست دارل
در این چهار روز من در مورد خودم با افرادی صحبت کردم که حتی نمی شناسم. مفید بود من
احساس خوبی دارد من احساس می کنم که مجبور نیستم با این عمل پیش بروم. لازم نیست خودم را جدا نگه دارم
از آنجا که من می ترسم مردم واقعاً چه کسی هستم. من از آن خوشحالم ممنون (تشویق)
کله
آفرین ممنون هرزنگ
من احساس انرژی فوق العاده ای می کنم که می خواهم میکروفون را انتخاب کنم و مایل به آن باشم
در مکالمه شرکت کنید ، و چیزی در مورد درست بودن و آنچه در آن به صورت نظم نیست نمی دانم
است فقط احساس انرژی خطر و خطر انرژی توسط قدرت و همه
که حالا احساس احمقانه می کنم. کله
اکنون شما فقط اینجا هستید. هرزنگ
من فقط اینجا هستم و من می ترسم که درگیر مکالمه شوم ، می خواهم درست در
مکالمه ، مایل به معقول بودن ، مایل به انتظار برای لحظه مناسب برای به اشتراک گذاشتن
درست کله
این یک کار بسیار بزرگ است ، آن تجارت انتظار برای لحظه مناسب ، چیز درست ، راه درست
برای انجام این کار ، این یک قاتل است. هرزنگ
این ارتباط زیادی با Cance Signifi دارد. من باید همه چیز را به شدت قابل توجه و
بسیار مهم کله
همه چیز باید بسیار قابل توجه باشد و بسیار مهم باشد؟ روز چهارم انجمن: جلسه سه 467
هرزنگ
بله واقعاً آن را به درجه های پوچ منتقل می کند. کله
مثل چی؟ هرزنگ
به عنوان مثال ، پنجشنبه ، من ماشینم را پارک کردم ، از ماشینم خارج شدم: من قدم به گه کردم ، گه های تحت اللفظی. (خنده)
"این به چه معنی است؟" و من شروع به فکر کردم که با جهان هماهنگ نیستم ، یا من
قدم به گله نمی کردم. بنابراین من آن را پاک می کنم. kipp (به خنده)
خیلی عالی است! شما قدم به قدم می گذارید: با جهان هماهنگ نیستید ... هریت
آه ، اما صبر کن! اما بعد از آن دیروز که ورنر در مورد پله در سگهای سگ صحبت می کرد ، فکر می کردم ،
"وای! من واقعاً این کار را درست انجام می دهم."
kipp (به خنده)
وای شما در لبه پیشرو گه هستید! هیچ چیز نمی تواند فقط اتفاق بیفتد! هریت (خنده)
این زندگی من است! کله
قدم به قدم در گهواره و هماهنگی آن با جهان. چیز دیگری هریت؟ هرزنگ
من هر آنچه را که در مقابل من است انتخاب می کنم. kipp (به خنده)
یا زیر شما هرزنگ
بله و من هنوز هم آن را قابل توجه می کنم. کله
درست است همه اینها می تواند به عنوان جهنم قابل توجه باشد. هرزنگ
درست بله 468
وجود
کله
آفرین خیلی ممنون کارن
در راه پایین آمدن از واشنگتن برای انجام این انجمن ، راننده اتوبوس از این کار شنیده بود
و او به من پیشنهاد داد که شستشوی مغزی است و من نباید این کار را انجام دهم. روز اول ، من آن را داشتم
فقط کمی فکر کرد منظورم این است که شستشوی مغزی اتفاق می افتد. کله
بله دوبله دوبله را مالش دهید. (خنده)
کارن (حرکت می کند که صحبت می کند)
سپس من به اشتراک گذاری گوش کردم و دیدم که اگر کار بتواند این نوع اصالت را فراخوانی کند ،
و آن اصالت را تشخیص دهید ، پس باید معتبر باشد. و این به همه معتبر است. همه
از آن من همه شما را می خواهم که به اشتراک بگذارید تا به این نتیجه برسید که چنین سهم بزرگی بوده است
برای دیدن افرادی که این نوع شجاعت و تمایل به قدم گذاشتن دارند و واقعاً عمیقاً است
حرکت برای دیدن مردم در برابر درد و اندوه و ترس به وجود می آید و هنگام آنها فشار می آورند
هرگز فکر نمی کردند که آنها بتوانند ، فوق العاده است ، و مردم در سن بزرگ هستند. من به آمریکا آمدم تا
ماجراجویی داشته باشید و عشق و شادی دو چیز نبودند که به خصوص در زندگی من وجود داشت
قبل از آمدن به اینجا ، و این همان چیزی است که من به اینجا رسیدم. کله
ممنون (تشویق)
شرکت کننده (رهبر انجمن 13)
من از سال 1975 در این کار شرکت کرده ام - این تقریباً نیمی از زندگی من است - و این بزرگترین است
کاری که من تا به حال انجام داده ام ... اولین دقیقه در برنامه اصلی که می دانستم هرگز چیزی ندیده ام
مثل این ، و من می دانستم که برای مدت طولانی و طولانی و از طریق چهارده یا فینال در این زمینه خواهم بود
سالهایی که من در آن شرکت کرده ام ، دیده ام که بسیاری از افراد به آن لحظه می رسند که در آن قرار دارند
لمس با زندگی از دست رفته یا ، گاهی اوقات ما آن را یک حادثه می نامیم ، من احتمالاً صد هزار نفر را دیده ام
مردم به آنچه برای آنها بود ، می رسند ، و من هرگز تا به امروز حس این را نداشته ام. من
پس از چهارده سال ، شما می توانید از کنار من عبور کنید ، اما
هرگز به نتیجه نرسید ، و من می خواهم اگر می توانم آن را به اشتراک بگذارم. وقتی مردم ایستاده و در مورد داشتن مشترک هستند
یک کودکی وحشتناک ، و داشتن این اتفاقات وحشتناک برای آنها اتفاق می افتد ، من چیزی شبیه به آن ندارم
که من بزرگترین دوران کودکی در جهان ، بزرگترین والدین را داشتم ، آنها به من گفتند که همه مرا دوست دارند
زمان ، آنها مرا به بهترین مدارس فرستادند. وقتی حدود چهار سال داشتم ، در کلاس اول بودم
از آنجا که می توانستم بخوانم و بنویسم ، من یک بچه کوچک واقعاً باهوش بودم و نمرات خوبی کسب کردم ، به آنجا رسیدم
افتخار تمام وقت ، و من نشان های شایستگی و پین های شایستگی و جوایز دریافت کردم ، و حتی نمی دانستم
نیمی از زمانی که آنها را به من می دادند. این طور نبود که من سخت کار می کردم ، یا مثل من
روز چهارم انجمن: جلسه سه 469
هر کاری انجام دادم ، من فقط به مدرسه رفتم و خدا را دوست داشتم و آنچه را که والدینم به من گفتند انجام دادم ، و
کار کرد چند سال به نوعی اینگونه بود. یادم می آید کلاس سوم را شروع کردم و اولین بار
روز - و من همیشه در ردیف مقدم نشسته ام ، دوست داشتم شرکت کنم - معلم مدام از همه اینها می پرسد
سؤالات و من همچنان دست خود را بالا می بردم ، مشارکت می کردم و به سؤالات پاسخ می دادم و می دادم
تمام پاسخ های درست ، و معلم گفت: "شما بهترین دانش آموز من خواهید بود." او ادامه داد
و یک سوال دیگر پرسیدم ، و من جواب خود را دادم و اشتباه کردم. و او به من نگاه کرد و
گفت: "این واقعاً احمق بود." و همین بود! همین بود! من فقط گفتم "خوب! خوب! ما این کار را خواهیم کرد
راه "و از آن زمان به همین ترتیب بوده است. و نکته جالب این است که من واقعاً این را پیدا کردم
نکته ای که در آن شروع به عقب نشینی کردم. شروع به تبدیل شدن به من کرد. تا آن زمان وجود نداشت
من ، فقط شرکت کننده بود و احساس می کردم زندگی همیشه یک امتیاز است ... کیپ
چیزی در آنجا وجود دارد ، کمی ابری شاید آن را ندیده باشید. تا آن نقطه آنجا
فقط مشارکت بود نه من وقتی واقعاً شرکت می کنید ، حتی در آنجا نیستید. شما
بدانید ، وقتی واقعاً می رقصید ، یا واقعاً آشپزی می کنید ، یا واقعاً درگیر چیزی در زندگی هستید
شما دوست دارید - این اتفاق می افتد ، نه شما. شرکت کننده (رهبر انجمن 13)
بنابراین وقتی او گفت "شما بهترین دانش آموز من خواهید بود" ، یا هر جهنمی که او به من گفت ، خوب
من هرگز در مورد آن فکر نکرده بودم ، هرگز فکر نمی کردم که بهترین یا بدترین یا هر چیز دیگری وجود داشته باشد
که من شروع به فکر کردم ، "خوب ، من بهترین خواهم بود!" و چیز احمقانه بعدی از من
دهان حرف دقیقی برای گفتن داشت ، و من تصمیم گرفتم که ... کیپ
چیز احمقانه بعدی که از دهان شما خارج شده بود چیز بعدی از دهان شما بود. شرکت کننده (رهبر انجمن 13 ، خنده)
من حتی به یاد نمی آورم که چه چیزی بود ، و وقتی امروز با آن در تماس شدم ، مثل این بودم ، "آه بله! من حادثه خود را کردم!" و این کاملاً تفاوت چندانی نداشت که بدانیم این چیست. هیچ KIPP (به تشویق)
خیلی ممنون می دانید ، داستانی در علم به نام تکامل وجود دارد. در آن داستان ،
چندی پیش ، مدتها پیش ، چیزی کمی وجود داشت که زندگی در آب شد. من
شروع به تکامل بیش از زمان. و سپس در یک لحظه ، یک فی از آب بیرون رفت
سرزمین این دیگر تکامل نیست. این تکامل تکامل است. این تحول است چه
چهار روز گذشته در مورد این بود که شما را برای پیاده روی در زمین پاکسازی می کند. وت
حقیقت این است که شما برای زمین مجهز نیستید. آنچه در مورد سمینارها وجود دارد ، تجهیزات شما به آن است
امکان جدیدی از رشد و یادگیری و نتایج خارق العاده در زمین ایجاد کنید. و اگر
شما قوانین آب را اعمال می کنید تا ببینید که آیا می خواهید در یک سمینار قرار بگیرید یا نه ، آنها نمی روند
به کار من از شما دعوت می کنم که در یک سمینار حضور داشته باشید. خود را با کدام سمینار نگران نکنید
اگر سمینار برای شما کار کند ، این کار را انجام دهید. اگر آن شب کار نمی کند ، دیگری را انتخاب کنید
یک برخی از شما می گویید ، اولین بار من باید این انجمن را هضم کنم. من از شما دعوت می کنم که چه چیزی را در نظر بگیرید
شما هضم می کنید به. از شما دعوت شده اید که شرکت کنید. و شما حق دارید که کاهش یابد ... ... چه زمانی
