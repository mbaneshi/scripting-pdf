SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (throwing the ball just out of Mike’s reach)
Why did you put your hand up there when I threw the ball?
MIKE
To catch the ball.
ERHARD
No you didn’t. Did you say, “I’m going to catch this ball?”
MIKE
To myself I did.
ERHARD
Did you really?
MIKE
Yes I did.
ERHARD (throwing the ball again out of Mike’s range)
What did you say then?
MIKE
I said...
ERHARD
You didn’t say a goddamned thing! Nothing. Afterwards, in the moment afterwards, you might
have said, “that’s not catchable.” If the ball was catchable for you, you would have reached over.
And you may or may not have caught it, but you would have reached over. Are you athletic?
(pausing)
Stop thinking! Are you athletic or not?
MIKE
I’m neither.
ERHARD
You’re a person for whom the ball is slow and fat. And I’m a person for whom the ball is very
small and fast. And the slower the ball goes, the more athletic you look. Is that clear?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
Very good. Thanks.
Forum Day Four: Session Three 497
(applause)
ERHARD (to another participant)
You got it before. And now some gas has been introduced and now you don’t get it, is that it?
(laughter)
MELINDA
I’ll keep it short, okay? I have a friend, his son is brain-damaged. His brain works fi ne except
for the part that controls his muscles. He can’t walk. If somebody throws him the ball, it’s
uncatchable.
ERHARD
Sure. If I cut your arms off  and throw you the ball, it’s uncatchable.
(laughter)
Don’t bring up this stupidity: It’s going to make you look silly. I’m not talking about some kind
of magic that if you were a rock and the ball occurred as catchable that you would reach up and
catch the ball.
MELINDA
I’m trying to see where this occurrence is.
ERHARD
It’s not in your muscles. Stick around. You’re asking the next question. Look, do you think with your
brain? You know that if we opened up your head and stuck a pencil in your brain you wouldn’t feel it?
MELINDA
I’ll accept that.
ERHARD
That’s the case. You don’t see with your brain. You see through your brain, maybe. It mediates
seeing. You don’t see with your eyes either. You know those things you didn’t see and now you
see? The eyes are a tube through which seeing comes, but not with what you see. And that’s the
case with the guy with brain damage.
MELINDA
You said it’s an ontological event, but how could an ontological event occur...
ERHARD
Because the ontological event expresses itself through a physical tube. That’s trivial.
MELINDA
That’s what I don’t get: That an ontological event could occur by cutting off  someone’s arms.
498
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
No, it does not. I said it can’t. If you can’t get it down the tube—if the tube’s blocked—your
brain, your nervous system, your muscles are just a tube to get it down. This is real simple.
We’re not talking about growing a third arm here. So it’s a trivial conversation to get stuck in
this muscles and bones and nerves thing. I’m willing to do it if we need to because I’m someone
who can stay up all night. But that’s not the conversation that you and I ought to be having
when we’re talking about your being able to behave eff ectively.
MELINDA
Okay.
ERHARD
Growing a third arm is a diff erent conversation. It’s true that your body is a tube down which
this gets expressed, but it’s only the tube. You know, I’ve worked with brain-damaged children.
There’s no less of a person there. There’s less of a person expressed. No question about it. There
are ways to get around the limits of the tubes. Blind people function with the same equipment
I’ve got at a way higher level than I do. Your body is merely the tube down which this gets
expressed. The tube is trivial.
(Melinda sitting)
About the occurring, and about access to the occurring... We now know that access to action is
in the occurring. You don’t gain access to action through decisions, and making up your mind,
and all that other nonsense. That’s a very weak access to your actions. If you checked and
counted up how many times you made up your mind and then checked how many times you
did what you made up your mind to do: very infrequently. It’s a lousy access to action. Takes
you forever to produce any eff ective action that way. Takes years of practice and discipline to
produce any eff ective action that way. And it isn’t the way to produce action, even taking years
to do it. It’s just a stupid way to behave and it’s based on a stupid explanation; an ineff ective way
to behave based on a stupid explanation.
(pausing to take a sip from a silver mug)
Now here’s another hard part. Where does the photographic image occur? Not on the paper!
Because if the photographic image occurred on the paper, everybody who looked at the paper
would see a photographic image. There are people who look at the paper and don’t see any
photographic image, that is to say, no photographic image occurs. Is that clear? Where does
the photographic image occur? This is the question you should be asking: Where does the
photographic image occur?
BARRY
When I’m shooting...
ERHARD
A photographic image is not shooting.
Forum Day Four: Session Three 499
BARRY
I’m a photographer.
ERHARD
Oh, I apologize: I forgot you were a photographer. I don’t want to know about taking pictures;
I want to know where the photographic image occurs. So if you show me a photograph: Where
does the image occur? It’s not on the paper.
BARRY
It’s the person who can recognize it there.
ERHARD
Where does that recognition happen?
BARRY
Through an association?
ERHARD
Not through association. The photographic image occurs in a medium called the possibility of
a photographic image. Now, how long is it going to take you to get this? This is pretty simple. A
photographic image occurs in a certain medium. The name of the medium is the possibility of
a photographic image. To say it a bit more rigorously, a photographic image occurs in a medium
called photographic image as a possibility. Photographic image as a presence, as an occurring,
occurs, happens in a medium called photographic image as a possibility. Is that clear?
BARRY
No.
ERHARD
Then you’re going to have to go home without that being clear then. Sorry. It’s hard.
(Barry sits)
The medium of occurrence is possibility. Possibility shapes the occurring. What Ellen and
I did was to shift the realm of possibility in which we were working. In one realm we were
working on the possibility of catching the ball. That had a smaller possibility for Ellen. In the
other realm we were working on the possibility of telling me which way the ball was spinning;
that had a bigger possibility for Ellen. Hence, the ball traveling at the same is speed, alters
its occurring speed, because occurring is a phenomenon which arises in a medium called
possibility. Not possibility like you mean possibility, something that might, maybe could,
maybe happen. Photographic image as a possibility is like—listen!—a clearing in which
photographic images can happen. It’s not a maybe, might. It’s not made up of photographic
images either. Photographic image as a possibility is not made up of photographic images,
any more than “two” as a possibility is made up of examples of two. As a matter of fact,
examples of two arise in the possibility “two.” So, access to your action, access to your feeling:
Enframing
For Heidegger, our technological understanding of Being emerges
in three stages: “challenging,” “standing-res erve,” and “enframing.”
Challenging
“The revealing that rules in modern technology,” Heidegger says
first, “is a challenging (Herausfordern), which puts to nature the
unreasonable demand that it supply energy which can be extracted
and stored as such.” Thus the “earth now reveals itself as a coal
mining district, the soil as a mineral deposit.” Heidegger protests
this development as a significant change from the days of “the old
windmill.” While the windmill served human beings, the call for its
service was left  to the wind’s blowing, since “the windmill does not
unlock energy from the air currents in order to store it.” Modern
technology, on the other hand, “sets upon nature,” always driving
on toward “the maximum yield at the minimum expense” (“QCT”
500
SPEAKING BEING
You’ve got no access to your feelings right now, do you? Yeah, you can’t feel sad if you want
to feel sad. You can’t be happy if you want to be happy. The circumstances determine your
happiness or your sadness. And all you got to deal with your feelings is fucking around with
your circumstances. So you do what you think you need to do to create circumstances that will
make you happy. And they don’t. They gratify you for a little while, and then you’re unhappy
again. So, to gain access to your actions, to gain access to your feelings and thoughts, as
actions so to speak, you need to see that your actions and thoughts and feelings are a correlate
with the occurring. And the occurring arises, occurs, in a medium called possibility. So now
the question is: “Well, how do I gain access to this possibility stuff ?” Because if I can shift
possibility, I can shift occurring; and if I can shift occurring, I can shift action. But you’ve got
to get possibility like I’m saying it, not like something that might happen. That’s an option.
Something that might happen is an option. That’s what Mike and I were talking about back
there, options. “If the ball is over there, I might be able to catch it.” That’s an option. “And if
it’s over here, it’s more likely that I’ll catch it.” That’s a better option. These are options, not
possibilities. Possibility doesn’t limit. It opens up. It frees one, not limits one. So possibility is
the medium of occurring, and occurring is the correlate of action. Does anybody not get that?
You’re starting to slide back into the fi rst day. You’re starting to wonder how to use this stuff .
“I don’t understand it.” What you’re really saying is “I don’t see its applicability. I don’t see
how I’m going to apply it, or use it. I don’t see how this is going to make me thinner, or richer,
or younger, or sexier. So I don’t understand it. If it isn’t going to make me thinner, or richer,
or younger, or sexier, then what is it?” So now the question is, “Where do I fi nd possibility?”
And the answer to that is in the ape never picking up the stick because he might fi nd bananas
hanging in the jungle clearing later on. Possibility arises in languaging. And I use the term
languaging instead of language so you don’t confuse what I’m talking about with vocabulary
and syntax and grammar. You know, music is languaging, action is languaging when it speaks,
and actions do speak don’t they? And “in a glass,” which is never said, and is yet present
without being said by virtue of what is said, that’s languaging too. And you want to know
what? Sitting in a chair is languaging. A lot of people would look at a chair and never sit in it.
It would look stupid to them: silly, uncomfortable, or nasty. Like sitting on two stakes sticking
up. You look at two stakes sticking up—that doesn’t look too comfortable to us. There are
people who look at a chair and don’t see it as a comfortable place to sit. It’s something to stand
on to get something in the cupboard that’s up high. Not a place to sit. And the way it occurs
to you is a product of languaging, not a product of what it is. Is a chair a chair? No, it’s not an
is chair, it’s an occurring chair. In other cultures it occurs as something to stand on to get up
to the cupboard that’s up high. It’s not an is chair; it’s an occurring chair. And your actions
with it are exactly like they are with the dictionary. Your actions are correlated to the object as
an occurring. So we’re sneaking up on a statement: You do have something to say about your
actions. You do have something to say about it. And why you have something to say about it is
because possibility arises in language.
At one point during this conversation, at about 10 pm, the doors to the room were opened and
about two hundred people fi led into the room and seated themselves in rows of chairs that had been
placed at the sides and rear. These were friends of the participants who had previously taken The
Forum, and who had been invited by them to join them, for this portion of the course.
in BW 320–321). As Michael E. Zimmerman has pointed out, this
new way of revealing has now overtaken even the windmill: “Forty
miles east of San Francisco in Livermore, California, thousands
of turbo-driven windmills cover the hills  as far as the eye can
see. The wind’s energy is, in fact, being  harnessed and stored to
produce electricity” (Heidegger’s Confrontation with Modernity
216). However, what stands in the way of windmills being really
useful as a power source is merely that no power can be generated
when the wind isn’t blowing. The solution, which is already likely
at hand, will be to invent super batteries that could store up the
energy for use and distribution when and where we need it. This
would transform the “freely flowing” wind into something stored
up, standing at the ready, in reserve.
Standing-Reserve
This situation reveals a second stage of the technological
understanding of Being, which Heidegger calls Bestand, or
standing-reserve. In this mode of revealing, says Heidegger,
“everything is ordered to stand by, to be immediately on hand,
indeed to stand there just so that it may be on call for a further
ordering” (“QCT” in BW 322). This mode of revealing distorts the
appearance of things: the airliner on the runway, for example,
“conceals itself as to what and how it is.”
Revealed, it stands on the taxi strip only as
standing-reserve, inasmuch as it is ordered to
insure the possibility of transportation. For this
it must be in its whole structure and in every
one of its constituent parts itself on call for
duty, i.e., ready for takeoff . (“QCT” in BW 322)
“
David Tabachnick has provided a useful contrast between
the old and new ways of revealing, between the techne of the
craft sman and the techne that we observe in current technology.
For the craft sman, “‘bringing-forth’ describes a working in
partnership or co-operation with the nature of materials to
construct an artifact, such as a chair or a house, while the
contemporary technologist is described as ‘challenging-forth’ or
changing the nature of materials to make them stronger, more
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day Four: Session Three 501
Erhard called on Jane, the young woman with whom he had interacted with on Days Two and Three
about her being “worthless” after having no one she invited come to her birthday party.
ERHARD
Jane and I were having a discussion when she was standing over there. And I said: “are you
going to act out of being worthless and ugly?” And she said “not as much but probably some.”
Right? Something close to that?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Is that true or false? It’s neither. The question is garbage. She has shaped the possibility for her
future actions because she shaped the world as an occurring, by speaking a possibility. She said
“my possibility is limited to this.”
(holding up both hands to eye level)
This is how big the possibility is. It’s that big because she said so. It’s not that big because she
believes it’s that big, and not because it is that big, not because it’s her opinion that it’s that big.
It’s that big because she said so. Remember, languaging is not just what’s coming out of your
mouth. I don’t say “in a glass,” and yet it’s there in languaging. I want to make sure nobody
confuses what we are saying with “positive thinking.” See, I’m not asking her to think positively.
I don’t like positive thinking. I’m an anti-positive thinker. I like honest thinking, not positive
thinking. I like straight thinking, not positive thinking. I know that possibility is a product of
languaging, but I don’t like the word product: possibility arises in language... and that Jane
can be a conversation for the possibility of anything she wants to be. See, where am I going to
fi nd “ugly”? Can I fi nd anything ugly in somebody’s face? This is not some nice platitudinal
horseshit. Things are ugly, but they’re ugly in people’s mouths, not on people’s faces. Ugly is not
a phenomenon that arises independent of language. My dog looks at me and sees neither ugly,
nor anything else about me, because ugly is a phenomenon that only arises in language. There’s
no ugly in anybody’s face or body. Faces and bodies are just like they are. Ugly is a phenomenon
that only arises in language. This doesn’t sound very useful, does it? It sounds what you call
abstract or conceptual. See, there’s a diff erence between is ugly and occurs as ugly. What’s
the diff erence between is ugly and occurs as ugly? Something called plasticity, malleability, or
something more aptly called possibility. If something is ugly you’ve got to adjust to it, don’t you?
(forcefully)
It is ugly so you have to adjust to it. If it occurs as ugly there’s the possibility of some
malleability, some plasticity, you might be able to shape it in a new way if it occurs as ugly. I
want you to begin to see that there’s a lot of what you deal with that only arises in language.
And because it only arises in language, you’ve got something to say about it. You’ve got
something to say about being ugly—no shit—because ugly only arises in language. I’ve seen
a lot of women whose features don’t measure the perfect standard who are extraordinarily
beautiful and so has every other man in this room. Beauty is not a matter of standard features.
flexible, longer lasting, etc.” Tabachnick continues, explaining that,
for example,
A doctor may “bring forth” the already avail-
able health of an individual through medicine,
whereas cloning or genetic engineering “chal-
lenge” the natural bounds of the body, creating
a wholly new “artifact” with diff erent charac-
teristics. As Heidegger details, earlier human
inventions did not permanently impose a new
form onto nature. Under normal conditions, be-
cause the material of an artifact was still bound
by natural characteristics, nature would always
“shine through” the imposition of the artist,
craft sman or technician. A carpenter imposes
the form of a chair onto wood, but once the
chair is finished that wood still maintains its
natural characteristics to rot and decompose
in the same way a fallen tree rots and decom-
poses on the forest floor. In other words, the
craft sman’s chair is a site of openness for the
revealing of nature. (Tabachnick 2004)
“
Tabachnick compares these earlier technologies with some that
are representative of more recent developments, “technologies
that do not co-operate with nature but attempt to replace it”:
A nuclear engineer can manipulate the struc-
ture of natural elements to produce artificial
elements. Plutonium, for example, is designed to
never abide by or return to the characteristics of
the uranium from which it was derived. The char-
acter of plutonium (i.e., its level of radioactivity)
is always artificial. Likewise, the genetically
altered human is designed to never return to the
natural characteristics of the material from which
it was derived (e.g., a sick or weak body) and
thus is always artificial. In turn, contemporary

SPEAKING BEING
It’s a way of being, not features. You know, it’s nice to have good equipment, but too fucking
bad, you’ve got the equipment you’ve got. Ugly is a conversation. That’s all it is. You can’t fi nd
ugly anyplace in the universe except in people’s mouths. That’s a metaphor. Now I’ll say it
rigorously. You can’t fi nd ugly anyplace but in languaging. And if you’re listening to this like
some platitude, then you are truly an asshole. This is hard stuff  I’m taking about. Not “nice
nice.” And “worthless.” Where am I going to fi nd “worthless”?
JANE
In the conversation “worthless.”
ERHARD
Yeah. Beautiful. See, you’ve got something to say about “worthless.” You’ve got nothing to
say about your feelings. You can’t feel anything but what you’re feeling. You’ve got nothing to
say about how you feel. But you’ve got something to say about worthless and ugly. Because
worthless and ugly are a conversation, that’s all. One is a conversation for being worthless, or
one is a conversation for being ugly. And that becomes the possibility in which life and the
world and your own image occurs for you. You don’t see yourself when you look in the mirror.
You don’t see yourself like an is, you see yourself like an occur; you see yourself as an occurring
self, not an is self. And what occurs in the mirror is not in the mirror. It’s in languaging,
therefore, you have access to what occurs in the mirror: Like a conversation for the possibility
of being beautiful. It’s idiotic to walk around saying “I’m beautiful,” especially if you look
like me. You look like her, maybe, because there’s some agreement for that. I didn’t say I walk
around speaking positively. I said it’s possible for me to be engaged in the conversation for the
possibility of being beautiful. I and you and the world will occur in the space, the clearing given
by that conversation for possibility. And my actions, and my feelings, and my thoughts, will be a
correlate of that occurring. And my actions, and my feelings, and my thoughts will work on the
world. You getting this?
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
And so you have something to say about this. What you say about it is none of my business.
That’s your business. We know why you said you were ugly and worthless, because you got
something out of that, right? For the payoff . Remember the payoff  conversation?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
And so ugly and worthless was a racket for a payoff . But there’s no payoff  for the possibility of
beauty. Beauty as an assertion, “I am beautiful,” like describing yourself, like you are an object,
there’s a payoff  in that. But there’s no payoff  in the possibility of beauty. As a matter of fact it
puts you further at risk, because now you’re at risk for being beautiful. When you’re ugly you
technological artifacts do not disclose nature.
And, because in a technological society so much
of our world is filled with these “undisclosing
artifacts,” we are cut off  from, become unaware
of, or forget the essential movedness or tran-
sience of existence. (Ibid.)
We remind the reader that we are not advocating a universal
return to wooden furniture; we do not regret advances in medical
science that employ new materials. To do so would be tantamount
to the demonstration Wes carried out during The Forum, earlier
in Day Four, of arguing with the floor. At the same time we are not
making an ethical statement concerning what the technological
understanding of Being has done to human beings such that
we might, as a matter of course, accept without question even
radically dangerous technological advances. Here we are simply
focusing on the view that we are already in a technological way
of Being-in-the-world, and therefore, what is at issue is the way of
being human that has emerged with these developments.
One principle way of being human that has emerged is one that
Erhard himself has exemplified in his development of his technology
of transformation: entrepreneurship. The term “entrepreneur”
stems from the French term entreprendre, to undertake. An
entrepreneur is an enterpriser. Far from accepting or even tolerating
the way things already are, the entrepreneur envisions and reveals,
through originary naming, new possibilities which alter the way
the world occurs. With language we impact the occurring world
and consequently, our Being, for our Being is always and already in
a dance with the occurring world. We bring into Being what could
never be without being said into Being: we speak Being.
The relationship to modern technology at work in Erhard’s
technology of transformation does not immediately square with
Heidegger’s persistent complaint that holds our technological way
of being as presenting us with profound danger. The diff erence is
subtle, and will require us to walk a thin line as both thinkers are
nevertheless treading the same waters.
For instance, if we envision Heidegger’s understanding of
our technological way of being as harmonic with the in-order-to

don’t have to risk much. You don’t have to put your lines out when you’re ugly. You all awake?
If you’re beautiful, you’ve got to put your lines out. You understand why?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Do you understand trolling?
JANE
Yeah.
(laughter)
ERHARD
Trolling is a game called being alive. And it’s as meaningful as everything else in life. Zero.
Therefore you’re free to play. And there are certain agreements in society about playing. And
society is weird, but that’s too bad: That’s what we got. I may not get a chance to talk to you
again tonight, and I want you to know how deeply grateful I am for your contribution to this
Forum. You’re really beautiful.
JANE
Thank you.
She sat to long applause from the group.
Erhard moved to the chalkboard, and drew three circles. The fi rst two he labeled “story” and “what
happened.”
ERHARD
Remember on the fi rst day, we drew these two circles. One was your “story” and the other
circle was “what happened.” So there was what happened, and there was your story about what
happened, and then we talked about the vicious circle where those two domains got collapsed,
and you couldn’t tell the diff erence between what happened and your story about what happened.
And you began to think that your story about what happened is what happened. And that makes
people suff er. Just like putting your hand on the gas stove makes you suff er. That’s why you
can’t trust psychology, because all of the then-known facts in psychology had been established
with experiments with rats and college sophomores, neither one of which might be human—I
don’t know about college sophomores, but I know that rats are not like human beings. And the
diff erence between a rat and a human being is a rat will stop crawling into the oven if it gets
burned, and human beings will keep crawling into the oven. Forever. Why? Because “it’s the right
fucking oven, and I believe in it.” And then we got more sophisticated and said there were two
realms of existence: that what existed, existed as a presence, and what existed, the same stuff , exists
as a concept. These are two distinct realms of existence, domains of existence.
mechanism of the “they” self, the two thinkers appear side-by-side,
but this is only a semblance. For Heidegger, one notable eff ect of
understanding the world as a source of resources is that humans
have surrendered their role as the self-certain ontologically centered
subject. Since standing-reserve is an “inclusive rubric,” it moves us
beyond the Cartesian subject-object model in which we have come to
conceptualize our relationship to things. Instead, says Dreyfus, “we are
passing from the subject-object stage to the stage in which the culture
is becoming, one might say, one big cybernetic system” (“Gaining”).
Clearly, this is not the overcoming of Cartesian subjectivity that the
early Heidegger of Being and Time and Erhard—from the est Training to
the present—have been working toward. It is not the opening for a new
possibility of Being for human beings. Instead:
As soon as what is unconcealed no longer
concerns man even as object, but exclusively
as standing-reserve, and man in the midst of
objectlessness is nothing but the orderer of the
standing-reserve, then he comes to the brink of
a very precipitous fall, that is, he comes to the
point where he himself will have to be taken as
standing-reserve. (“QCT” in BW 332, emphasis
added)
“
This precipitous fall, we off er, has already taken place: this is the
way of being human The Forum addresses in its participants from
the very beginning. Those seeking to improve, to acquire the tips
and techniques to overcome and change their lives for the better,
who take any morsel of wisdom and put it to use, all the better to
order it, but in the process they—we—unwittingly rob the truth,
as unconcealment, of its power—this is the way of being that self-
destructs against the bulwark of the Nothing the inquiry of The
Forum brings to presence.
Enframing
And so, we arrive at the final stage in the way modern technology
reveals the world: “the essence of modern technology,” says
Heidegger, “lies in enframing [Gestell]” (“QCT” in BW 328). This

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (indicating the “story” circle)
In this realm there are things like explanations.
(indicating the “what happened” circle)
And in this realm there are things like experience. So one is the experience and the other
is the explanation of the experience. This was the whole story at the time we discussed this
earlier. We were going backwards. We got to zero, we got to empty and meaningless. Now
we’re seeing that there are two sides to The Forum. The fi rst side is “What is the already
always being of human beings?” And the other side is “What is the possibility of being for
human beings?” Now you heard “What is the possibility of being for human beings” as the
something maybe, could I, might be, maybe, like some stupid image you got of yourself as
thin and sexy and young and rich, or whatever your silly notion is for your self. Holy. It fi ts
in there. The same crap.
(indicating the fi rst two circles)
That’s what you got born with. That’s what came with the package—those two domains. There’s
another domain.
(drawing a new circle to the left of the “what happened” circle)
It doesn’t come with the package. You don’t get it for free.
(indicating the “story” circle)
You can talk about that domain right here, but that’s talking about it. That’s like eating the
menu.
(indicating the third, still empty circle to the left of the “what happened” circle and of the “story”
circle)
A lot of people talking about this domain.
(indicating the “what happened” circle)
You can even have experiences of it. People who merely have the experience of it get weird. Lot
a weird people in this room, by the way. They gravitate to California.
(laughter)
People with the experience of that other domain: Makes them weird. They can’t get over it, so they
stay weird. They’ve got no mastery of the domain. They don’t dwell in the domain; they don’t come
from the domain. They don’t dwell in it, but they’ve touched it experientially. Everybody in the room
has had that experience. Everybody. Some of you haven’t had enough of that experience to be weird
yet, that’s all. You know that experience where you don’t have to eat, where you don’t have to go to
the bathroom, and you don’t have a home, and there’s nothing but what you’re doing. You’re not even
there, right? It’s like when you get out of the way, and there’s that thing that happens when you’re out
of the way? By the way, when do you come back? When it goes bad. Right away you’re right there:
“Oh shit!”
is the culmination, the gathering of the challenging-forth and
ordering, the box in which human beings as resources already
find themselves at this juncture in our history. To employ the
vernacular, the technological way of Being is a done deal: “The
actual threat has already aff licted man in his essence. . . . Thus the
question as to how we are to arrive at a relationship to the essence
of technology, asked in this way, always comes too late” (“QCT” in
BW 333, 329). In a 1966 interview with the German newsmagazine
Der Spiegel, asked what was missing in the world when, aft er all,
everything seemed to be functioning and production was at a
peak, Heidegger replied: “Everything is functioning. This is exactly
what is so uncanny, that everything is functioning and that the
functioning drives us more and more to even further functioning,
and that technology tears men loose from the earth and uproots
them” (in Zimmerman’s Heidegger’s Confrontation with Modernity
199, emphasis added). Thus uprooted, says Dreyfus, human
beings “become a resource to be used, and more importantly to be
enhanced, just like any other resource” (“Gaining”).
And yet, it is Erhard’s technology of transformation that brings
forth its participants to arrive at such a relationship to the essence
of technology, right in the midst of being torn loose from the earth,
used and enhanced as any resource would be, caught up in the
relentless logic of the in-order-to. Rather than turn away from the
technological way of being we are thrown to be, the inquiry of The
Forum directs its participants to come face-to-face with it, to own
up to it, to be in the trap that it is for human being. ■
