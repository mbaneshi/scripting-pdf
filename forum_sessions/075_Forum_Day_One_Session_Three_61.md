Forum Day One: Session Three 61
way, a way you‚Äôre going to have to invent rather than discover. Namely, what
you‚Äôre willing to put at stake. You can‚Äôt ever find something at stake. You can
only invent it, create it. It‚Äôs a creative act, it‚Äôs a self-generated challenge which
you create for yourself. And that‚Äôs who you are for The Forum. Some of the
tools you need for this we haven‚Äôt developed in here yet. The first place you
will look is at what‚Äôs wrong with you. Let that be. This is confusing because
it requires real thinking. Your reasons got you here but they are no longer
sufficient. During the meal break, I invite you to create what you‚Äôre willing to
put at stake.
(pausing)
This works. We‚Äôre not wondering anymore whether The Forum works. We‚Äôre
promising you that you can have anything you are willing to stand for having
gotten in The Forum. And the access to that is your willingness to put yourself
at stake here in The Forum. This requires speaking. You speak yourself in the
matter. The first action which it requires is speaking, speaking what you‚Äôre
putting at stake. And the second part is to promise to be your word. Have a
conversation with others at dinner about this: if your life were an expression,
what would that expression be? The Forum won‚Äôt provide you with what‚Äôs
possible out of a reason for being here. At-stakeness is something that exists
the moment you create it as a possibility. What we‚Äôre asking you to do is to
begin to create your life. What you‚Äôre willing to stand for in here is what you
have at stake.
PARTICIPANT
What‚Äôs the difference between The Forum and positive thinking?
KIPP
Remember that ‚Äústop thinking‚Äù exercise we mentioned earlier? Try to make
all those thoughts positive. It‚Äôs a difficult thing to do, trying to make some-
thing you have nothing to do with positive. Like, ‚ÄúOh my God! There‚Äôs a bad
thought! It‚Äôs supposed to be positive!‚Äù
(to the group)
During the meal break, you are to create what you are willing to put at stake
like a possibility. Have a conversation with another person and with who you
are going to have dinner with.
Following this discussion, Julie came onto the platform and announced a meal
break at 6:20 pm.
JULIE  (continuing to read the suggested promises)
(1) Eat only during the one announced meal break. Eat a big breakfast.
(2) Don‚Äôt sit next to someone you knew before The Forum started.
(3) Advise us of the phone number where you‚Äôre staying this week.
Assistants distributed phone information cards.
PARTICIPANT
Is gum chewing forbidden in The Forum?
KIPP
How many drops of pee does it take to spoil the stew?
PARTICIPANT
One.
KIPP
Get it?
PARTICIPANT
I know I should say yes. I know the group is the stew. Am I the pee?
KIPP
You‚Äôre at a moment of choice now.
(to the group)
What are some reasons for being in The Forum?
PARTICIPANTS (several calling out)
So my speaking is a possibility for people; Because I know there‚Äôs more out
there; etc.
KIPP
Now let‚Äôs hear some things you could fix from being in The Forum.
Again, people called out answers, a series of standard benefi ts similar in quality to
the fi rst group of responses.
KIPP
Neither of these provide you with what work The Forum has for you. A reason
for being here, or something to fix, won‚Äôt provide you with what you need
to be in The Forum. So we‚Äôre going to have to think of being here in a new

SPEAKING BEING
Yankelovich Study Results
Prior to the delivery of The Forum presented in this book, Werner Erhard and Asso-
ciates (WE&A) commissioned a study by noted social scientist Daniel Yankelovich,
SESSION THREE INTERVAL
wherein he analyzed the results reported by graduates of the course. By the time
the results of the study were published, circa 1991, Erhard had sold WE&A to his em-
ployees, and that company today is called Landmark. Here is the summary of those
results and Yankelovich‚Äôs analysis.
An Analysis of The Forum and Its Benefi ts
A Yankelovich (DYG, Inc.) Study
Summary
Internationally recognized social scientist Daniel Yankelovich surveyed more than 1300 people who completed The
Forum during a three-month period. Prior to their course, people were asked what they expected to achieve in the
course; after their course, they were asked about the benefits they actually received.
The study explored four areas: the value of The Forum, the profile of participants, satisfaction levels after The Forum,
and unexpected benefits that were experienced. A few of the findings include:
‚Ä¢  More than 90% of participants report practical and enduring value for their life ‚Äî well worth the time and
cost.
‚Ä¢  More than 90% of participants report a better understanding of relationships and their role in them.
‚Ä¢  Nearly every participant received unexpected benefits ‚Äî ranging from achieving personal and
professional goals.
‚ÄúSeveral of the study‚Äôs findings surprised me quite a bit, especially the large number of participants for whom The
Forum proved to be ‚Äòone of the most valued experiences of my life.‚Äô This is not a sentiment that people, particularly
successful, well-educated people, express lightly. I can understand why people recommend The Forum to their
associates, friends, and relatives.‚Äù
Daniel Yankelovich, Chairman
DYG, Inc. (public opinion analyst)
Daniel Yankelovich, Chairman of DYG, Inc., a noted social scientist and public opinion analyst, as well as a leading
researcher of values and future trends who has been conducting these kinds of studies for more than 30 years,
did an analysis of the survey.
The following charts indicate the value reported from The Forum, the benefits most often cited as a result of their
participation, and their level of satisfaction.
Daniel Yankelovich is a
leading interpreter of trends
shaping American society
and the global economy. He
is the author of 10 books
and chairman/founder of
three organizations: Public Agenda; DYG, Inc.; and
Viewpoint Learning. His pioneering work has earned
him numerous awards in the field of public opinion
research.
‚Äú More than 7 out of 10 found the
course to be one of their life‚Äôs
most rewarding experiences.
To me, this suggests that it
addresses many of people‚Äôs
most profound concerns ‚Äî
to improve their personal
relationships, how to be a more
effective person, how to think
productively about their lives
and goals.‚Äù
