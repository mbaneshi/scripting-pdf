Forum Day Four: Session One
351
can’t get to empty and meaningless in-order-to. And every time you turn it into an in-order-to,
you lose that it’s empty and meaningless, because the truth is sucked out of it, and it becomes a
mere platitude.
DENNIS
I just want to end with saying that I will leave here with the thought that life is empty and
meaningless and that opens up a possibility.
ERHARD
I don’t want you to leave with “it opens up a possibility.” That ruins it.
DENNIS
Is that an in-order-to?
ERHARD
Yeah. See, you’re a real in-order-to guy. That’s not bad. That’s not an insult. That’s highly valued
in this culture. We place a lot of value in this culture in in-order-to.
DENNIS
Thank you.
ERHARD
Yep. Very good. Thank you.
(applause)
(turning to another participant)
What is your story?
JOYCE
My story is that I get it and I reject it.
ERHARD
Okay. Don’t do that. What are you crying about? Do you know? Yeah, you know, what are you
crying about?
JOYCE
Because I came to make a change in my life and I don’t see it happening.
ERHARD
Yes. I understand. So, you wanted to make a change in your life because there’s a little suff er-
ing there, yes? Yeah. The way to perpetuate the suff ering is to try to change your life. You stop
changing your life, the suff ering will go away. Is that clear?

SPEAKING BEING
JOYCE
Yes. It’s clear.
ERHARD
So, don’t do that anymore. Cut that out. Stop rejecting it. Stop trying to get better. Stop trying to
change your life. What is it you want out of life, that’s so goddamned important that you want
to change your life? What is it that’s bothering you because it’s missing?
JOYCE
I want to like myself. I don’t like myself.
ERHARD
Okay. Now. Start not liking yourself. Do that right now. Don’t like yourself right now.
(Joyce laughing)
What are you smiling about? I thought you said you didn’t like yourself.
(laughter)
Don’t like yourself some more. This is pretty good. Now don’t like yourself even more. You
notice everything changed. Now like yourself. Like yourself.
JOYCE
It’s not diff erent.
ERHARD
It’s no fucking diff erent is it?
(laughter)
Liking yourself and not liking yourself are the same thing: It’s all bullshit.
(raising his voice to a pitch)
What is this goddamned fantasy about liking yourself? What in the fuck is that? That’s crazy!
That’s like walking around saying “Don’t look! Don’t look! Oh my God there’s a man back there
following me with a knife with blood dripping down.” Bullshit people made up: liking your-
self/not liking yourself. You know what not liking yourself is? It’s a conversation you have with
yourself. Bullshit people made up, this “liking yourself/not liking yourself.” You know what
not liking yourself is? It’s a conversation you have with yourself.
JOYCE
It’s a conversation I constantly have with myself.
ERHARD
Yeah, but stop it then. This is craziness. What is the signifi cance of liking yourself or not liking
yourself? Does it change a hair on your head?
