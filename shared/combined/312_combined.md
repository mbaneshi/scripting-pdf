SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Sure. So it makes the conversation a bit hard for you to hear. But now that we’ve said that let’s
do what you asked to have done and take a deeper look.
SUZANNE
Yes.
ERHARD
So, did it make sense—was it valid for you—what I said that you and I and everybody else,
as little girls or boys, had experiences in which it’s entirely logically, so powerfully logical, so
predictable that we’re going to conclude that there’s something wrong, that we could all accept
that at some point in our childhood we did conclude that there’s something wrong here? Or was
that the logic you were questioning?
SUZANNE
I’m not going to add to that statement. That’s a period. There’s something wrong here. But in
addendum you said “there’s something wrong here and the achievement is there.” That premise
is correct.
ERHARD
Okay good, I’m just trying to fi nd out where the sticking point is.
SUZANNE
I agree with that premise.
ERHARD
So then I said that it’s not a mere conclusion, I said that you become that there is something
wrong. You are that there is something wrong. You know, you’re a four-year-old, a fi ve-year-
old, and become that there’s something wrong and it becomes the shaping ground of being for
everything you built. See, you built a Suzanne, and I built a Werner, and he built whoever he is.
And I did it over years. I had a certain aspect of me built by the time I was fi ve. I had another
aspect of myself built by the time I was nine. By the time I was seventeen I was pretty much
built. Everything I’ve done since I was seventeen has been additive. I’ve gotten a little better, or
a lot better at those things I was good at, or the things I could be good at. In any case, around
that age, seventeen or twenty, they’ve built their persona, they’ve built an identity, they’ve built
a self. Okay, I said that that self that I built was built in response to the ground of being called
there is something wrong here.
SUZANNE
For this moment I will accept that and think about it.
ERHARD
Okay. Let me just give you one thing. That’s an assertion. And an assertion deserves evidence,
because an assertion is a promise that I’ve got evidence. So I’m going to give you my evidence.
Forum Day Three: Session Four
299
My evidence is that your best and my best moments, my talents, the “what I’m good at,” the
“what I can be counted on”—including getting married, a good moment; having children,
raising children, a good moment; doing well in my job, a good moment: I’m talking about
the stuff ... I use to generate achievement. The exercise of that does not leave me full, whole,
complete, full of joy. It’s gratifying. God knows that whenever I have an accomplishment, I feel
great: a couple of moments, a couple of hours, a couple of days, a couple of weeks, maybe even
a year. But at some point I’m back to: that wasn’t enough.
SUZANNE
So where is the satisfaction?
ERHARD
The level of satisfaction is that there’s no full satisfaction. There’s no being complete with life.
One is always incomplete. It’s the conversation we had earlier about someday. See, someday,
someday I’m going to contribute enough, achieve enough, to have made it. No. Because
every accomplishment makes the context—there’s something wrong here—bigger, more
stronger, more valid, all that below the level of awareness. See up at the level of awareness I’m
developing myself and being a decent human being and making some sort of contribution,
and taking care of myself and taking care of the people around me. That’s all content, that’s all
foreground. The context, the background, which is reinforced by every achievement, is “there
is something wrong here.” What that leads to is never being satisfi ed. Ever. Never being full of
joy. Never. Never being complete never being whole. Life is always incomplete. And life is lived
as a struggle to be complete, to fi nally be satisfi ed. So that’s my evidence. It doesn’t prove what I
said, because you can’t prove an assertion. But it does validate it.
SUZANNE
So it’s best to assume that in anything we do we have that, we don’t get satisfi ed. There’s more. I
should assume that there should be more.
ERHARD
I’m not saying you should assume that, I’m saying we live like that. You and I and the other
eight hundred people sitting in this room and the other half a million people that I’ve
worked with.
SUZANNE
So that follows the logic that life is meaningless and empty, and therefore if life is meaningless
and empty, it is zero. Zero.
ERHARD
I don’t want to make the conclusion you made. Yes, what we are saying here is entirely
harmonic with that life is meaningless and empty. You see it got to be pretty clear that
everybody’s soap opera was bullshit, meaningless and empty, now I want to get it clear that the
rest of it is bullshit: the good parts. I want you to see where they come from. So that you get that
the whole thing is meaningless and empty. It’s not that I want it to be that way. It is that way.
300
SPEAKING BEING
SUZANNE
Yes. I get you.
ERHARD
Thank you very much.
(returning to The Forum leader who had shared about living life in order not to be embarrassed)
What did you say to get us started down this conversation with Suzanne? Is there anybody left
that doesn’t get that as you built the content called accomplishment and contribution, you are
reinforcing the context for that contribution, which context is “there’s something wrong.” Is
that clear for everybody?
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 8)
So I wouldn’t be so foolish as to ask how to get out of this predicament.
ERHARD
Yeah, because you don’t.
PARTICIPANT (Forum Leader 8)
I’m too smart I guess.
ERHARD
You see: What do you do about being dead?
(laughter)
Nothing. See it’s not a bad thing to know that you’re dead when you’re dead. You lie down.
You know that there are some dead people in the room? There are actually some dead people
in here–walking around bolt upright, dead though. There are people in here who have killed
themselves. They didn’t kill their bodies, they killed their selves. Their bodies walk around but
they are dead. There are dead people in here. You might even fi nd out that you were dead. That
would be good news because then you could lie down and relax.
(laughter)
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 9)
So one of the surprises for me in this Forum is that yesterday I saw that my racket is that I’m a
victim...
ERHARD
This is very surprising to hear from a guy like this. Very accomplished, very able guy.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 9)
And I’ve always disliked victims. So other than, so tonight for dinner, after the series of
meetings I ended up that there was nobody to go to dinner with, and the violins begin to come
Forum Day Three: Session Four
301
out. And true to what you said yesterday it occurred to me that this was me running my victim
racket. I laughed at myself for a moment. And then I went to fi nd some people to go have
dinner with.
ERHARD
See, hold on a second. He’s a little bit ahead of us. I almost wish he didn’t say that because now
he’s leaked out the truth, and you’ll latch on to that real fast. That’ll be the new prison bars.
When you get that it’s empty and meaningless you see things you’ve never seen before. As long
as you’re stuck with your soap opera you can’t see those things. For instance, if who you are is
that people are unable, you can’t see the opportunities to develop their ability. And you can’t
see their ability. As soon as you get that that’s your racket, as soon as you get that whole soap
opera that you’ve got to do everything your self because there’s nobody around able enough to
do it, you begin to see things you didn’t see before. Now, I shouldn’t have told you that, you see,
because you’ll spend the whole night trying to fi gure out how to get out of the trap. And you’ll
come in here tomorrow all stuck in the trap again. We’ll have to spend the whole day getting
you out of the trap. And then we’ll have to do an extra day of The Forum with you all. Go ahead.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 9)
So I’m actually not going to ask the question now. But what I have gotten, and just to share,
one is that some people’s coaching for me recently is to take myself a little less seriously and I
can hear the room to be that way now. Secondly, is I’ve been able to share myself with people,
Werner, not like something happened.
ERHARD
To speak himself. Not in-order-to.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 9)
I can see as a graduate, staff  member, and Forum leader candidate, that that’s probably
something for all of us to take on, the sharing in-order-to business.
ERHARD
Good. Thank you.
(applause)
ALEX
What about a child who’s been told everything’s right?
ERHARD
That’s called Skinner’s “glass box,” and Skinner already demonstrated that it doesn’t work. Did
you get my answer?
ALEX
Yes.
“
For instance, if who you are is that people
are unable, you can’t see the opportunities
to develop their ability. And you can’t
see their ability. As soon as you get that
that’s your racket, as soon as you get
that whole soap opera that you’ve got to
do everything your self because there’s
nobody around able enough to do it, you
begin to see things you didn’t see before.
302
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
The other answer is that you don’t actually get that from what happens, you’re already always
that as a human being. In other words, you are “there is something wrong here” waiting to
happen. See listen, if we had the time, and we don’t—that’s another program—I would get up
enough people in here whose experience was almost always what you and I would call positive.
The athletic kids, the successful kids, the right kind of families. And you would fi nd out that
they had somehow fucked that up. It’s amazing. Hard to believe. There are people in here like
those kids we grew up with that we thought had it all. People like that in here. And if they stood
up and shared with you, they would tell you that it was bad.
ALEX
Yeah.
ERHARD
So there’s no way to escape it. Even if you’re told “you’re wonderful,” “you can have anything
you want,” “life is great.” Now, that is preferable over being told that you’re shit. No question
about that.
ALEX
That is my question. Is that preferable?
ERHARD
Oh sure. It’s kind of like carrying less baggage. You’re still going to carry the baggage. You’re
still going to get into the trap. You can’t keep your kids out of the trap.
ALEX
The kid is told “You can do anything you want to,” or the parent gets that child in as much
diffi  culty as to tell the child they’re worthless. Is it in the same elevator shaft, or is it diff erent?
ERHARD
That’s correct. I’ve looked at it as far as I can see it, and yes. But it’s too long of a conversation to
have right now.
LUCY
Two things. One I found this conversation the most powerful for me personally. The experiences
that I heard are very applicable to me.
ERHARD
One will hear oneself in other’s sharing.
LUCY
I think I understand why I don’t get a sense of fulfi llment out of the many things that I...
Forum Day Three: Session Four
303
ERHARD
Sure because you’re an accomplished person.
LUCY
I am trying to avoid something, that feeling that something is wrong. But the next question that
comes to mind is what is the strategy to fi x that? And you said you don’t fi x it.
ERHARD
No you don’t.
LUCY
But I don’t agree with that.
ERHARD
It’s not that you don’t agree with that. You are addicted to fi xing it.
LUCY
That’s true.
ERHARD
You have to have an answer.
LUCY
Not an answer, but to fi nd a way to fi x it, and then fi x it.
ERHARD
Yeah. You and Suzanne ought to get together. These are two achievement nuts. You can’t fi x it.
LUCY
Why not?
ERHARD
Well, you tell me how to fi x being dead and I’ll tell you how to fi x it.
LUCY
Well a lot of things are one’s frame of mind and how you think things...
ERHARD
That’s not true. A lot of things are explained using the terminology of the frame through which
you look at things. Like positive thinking. Good stuff . What kind of a person would need to
think positively?
LUCY
Somebody who’s kind of negative.
304
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Yeah. Every time you think positively, that is the content. The context is negative, that you are
a negative person. Life is negative. No kidding. I’ve done that whole achievement thing for
quite a while. Made a lot of money doing that. Lot of money. That whole business about being
successful and achieving, and positive thinking. You name it I did it. And it works. The problem
is that it’s never enough. Never fulfi lled, never whole. What you’re asking me is how to get out
of the trap and the answer is that the attempt to get out of the trap is what keeps you in the trap.
I want you to think about this tonight. This is hard to get. Because getting out is supposed to get
you out. In this case getting out keeps you in. This is a very strange kind of prison. The bars are
not made of iron. They are made out of the attempt to get out of the prison. So Lucy, tonight, I
want you to see if you can come to accept that you’re going to have to live the rest of your life in
this prison.
LUCY
I have another question. The concept... life is empty and...
ERHARD
I don’t talk in concepts. Distinctions.
LUCY
I’m trying to relate how we can apply it to our lives.
ERHARD
You cannot apply it. Worthless, useless information.
LUCY
Then what’s the purpose in knowing that? Or accepting that?
ERHARD
Because it’s the truth.
LUCY
But how can knowing that or accepting that create personal power for us?
ERHARD
So wonderful. Hold on one second, I’ll be right back.
(to the group)
Lucy and I are going to demonstrate terminally that you are addicted to the answer, that you are
addicted to getting out, to getting the answer. That no matter how many times I’m going to tell
you that the attempt to get out is the bars of the prison, you’re going to spend the rest of your
life trying to get out. She’s going to demonstrate the very thing I’m talking about; she’s going to
demonstrate that she’s going to spend the rest of her life trying to get out. And nothing I tell her
is going to stop her. There are no answers. You don’t get out. It’s not going to work out. It’s not

درز
مطمئناً بنابراین این مکالمه را برای شما کمی سخت می کند. اما اکنون که ما گفتیم که اجازه دهید
کاری را که از شما خواسته اید انجام دهید انجام دهید و نگاه عمیق تری داشته باشید. سوزان
بله درز
بنابراین ، آیا این منطقی بود - برای شما معتبر بود - آنچه من گفتم که شما و من و همه افراد دیگر ،
همانطور که دختران یا پسران کوچک ، تجربیاتی داشتند که در آن کاملاً منطقی است ، بسیار قدرتمند ، بنابراین
قابل پیش بینی است که می خواهیم نتیجه بگیریم که مشکلی وجود دارد ، که همه ما می توانیم بپذیریم
که در بعضی از مواقع از کودکی ما نتیجه گرفتیم که در اینجا مشکلی پیش آمده است؟ یا بود
این منطق شما را زیر سوال می برد؟ سوزان
من نمی خواهم به آن بیانیه اضافه کنم. این یک دوره است اینجا مشکلی وجود دارد اما در
ضمیمه شما گفتید: "اینجا مشکلی وجود دارد و دستاورد در آنجا وجود دارد." این فرضیه
درست است درز
خوب خوب ، من فقط سعی می کنم از نقطه چسبیدن در کجا قرار بگیرم. سوزان
من با آن فرض موافقم. درز
بنابراین من گفتم که این نتیجه گیری صرف نیست ، من گفتم که شما می شوید که چیزی وجود دارد
اشتباه تو هستی که مشکلی وجود دارد. شما می دانید ، شما یک چهار ساله هستید ، یک سال
پیر ، و تبدیل به این شده است که مشکلی وجود دارد و به شکل گیری شکل گیری برای بودن تبدیل می شود
هر چیزی که ساختید ببینید ، شما یک سوزان ساختید ، و من یک ورنر ساختم ، و او هر کس که هست ساخت. و من این کار را طی سالها انجام دادم. من جنبه خاصی از من داشتم تا زمانی که من از آن استفاده می کردم. من دیگری داشتم
جنبه خودم که در نه سالگی ساخته شده ام. تا زمانی که هفده سال داشتم تقریباً زیاد بودم
ساخته شده هر کاری که من از هفده سالگی انجام داده ام ، افزودنی بوده است. من کمی بهتر شده ام ، یا
خیلی بهتر از آن چیزهایی که من در آن خوب بودم ، یا چیزهایی که می توانستم در آن خوب باشم. در هر صورت ، اطراف
در آن سن ، هفده یا بیست ، آنها شخصیت خود را ساخته اند ، آنها هویتی ساخته اند ، آنها ساخته اند
خود خوب ، من گفتم که خود که من ساخته ام در پاسخ به زمین خوانده شده ساخته شده است
اینجا مشکلی وجود دارد. سوزان
برای این لحظه آن را می پذیرم و به آن فکر می کنم. درز
خوب بگذارید فقط یک چیز به شما بدهم. این یک ادعا است و یک ادعا سزاوار شواهد است ،
از آنجا که یک ادعا قولی است که من شواهدی دریافت کرده ام. بنابراین من می خواهم شواهد خود را به شما ارائه دهم. روز اول انجمن: جلسه چهارم
299
شواهد من این است که بهترین و بهترین لحظات من ، استعدادهای من ، "آنچه من خوب هستم"
"آنچه می توانم روی آن حساب کنم" - از جمله ازدواج ، یک لحظه خوب. بچه دار شدن ،
بزرگ کردن کودکان ، یک لحظه خوب ؛ در کار من خوب کار می کنم ، لحظه خوبی: من در مورد آن صحبت می کنم
چیزها ... من برای تولید موفقیت استفاده می کنم. تمرین آن مرا کامل ، کامل ،
کامل ، پر از شادی. خوشحال کننده است خدا می داند که هر وقت من یک موفقیت دارم ، احساس می کنم
عالی: چند لحظه ، چند ساعت ، چند روز ، چند هفته ، شاید
یک سال اما در بعضی از مواقع به آن بازگشتم: این کافی نبود. سوزان
بنابراین رضایت کجاست؟ درز
سطح رضایت این است که هیچ رضایت کامل وجود ندارد. با زندگی کامل نیست. یکی همیشه ناقص است. این مکالمه ای است که ما قبلاً در مورد روزی داشتیم. ببینید ، روزی ،
روزی می خواهم به اندازه کافی کمک کنم ، به اندازه کافی دست یابم تا آن را بسازم. نه چون
هر دستاورد این زمینه را ایجاد می کند - در اینجا چیزی اشتباه است - bigger ، بیشتر
قوی تر ، معتبرتر ، تمام آنچه در زیر سطح آگاهی است. در سطح آگاهی من را ببینید
خودم را توسعه می دهم و یک انسان مناسب و معقول هستم و به نوعی کمک می کنم ،
و مراقبت از خودم و مراقبت از افراد اطرافم. این همه محتوا است ، این همه است
پیش زمینه زمینه ، پیش زمینه ، که توسط هر دستاوردی تقویت می شود ، "در آنجا است
اینجا چیزی اشتباه است. " آنچه که منجر به رضایت نمی شود هرگز.
شادی هرگز هرگز کامل بودن هرگز کامل نیست. زندگی همیشه ناقص است. و زندگی زندگی می کند
به عنوان یک مبارزه برای کامل بودن ، به طور کامل رضایت بخش است. این شواهد من است این اثبات نمی کند
گفت ، زیرا شما نمی توانید یک ادعا را اثبات کنید. اما آن را تأیید می کند. سوزان
بنابراین بهتر است فرض کنیم که در هر کاری که انجام دهیم ، رضایت نمی دهیم. موارد بیشتری وجود دارد من
باید فرض کنید که باید تعداد بیشتری وجود داشته باشد. درز
من نمی گویم شما باید این را فرض کنید ، من می گویم ما چنین زندگی می کنیم. شما و من و دیگری
هشتصد نفر در این اتاق نشسته اند و نیم میلیون نفر دیگر که من آنها هستم
کار با سوزان
بنابراین این منطق را دنبال می کند که زندگی بی معنی و خالی است ، بنابراین اگر زندگی بی معنی باشد
و خالی ، صفر است. صفر درز
من نمی خواهم نتیجه ای را که شما ساخته اید نتیجه بگیرم. بله ، آنچه ما در اینجا می گوییم کاملاً است
هارمونیک با آن زندگی بی معنی و خالی است. می بینید که کاملاً واضح است که
اپرا صابون همه زوزه ، بی معنی و خالی بود ، اکنون می خواهم آن را روشن کنم که
بقیه آن گلوله است: قسمتهای خوب. من می خواهم شما ببینید که از کجا آمده اند. به طوری که آن را بدست آورید
همه چیز بی معنی و خالی است. این طور نیست که من می خواهم اینگونه باشد. اینگونه است 300
وجود
سوزان
بله من تو را می گیرم درز
خیلی ممنون (بازگشت به رهبر انجمن که در مورد زندگی زندگی مشترک بوده است تا خجالت نکشیده شود)
چه گفتید تا ما این مکالمه را با سوزان شروع کنیم؟ آیا کسی مانده است
این امر به این نتیجه نمی رسد که شما محتوایی به نام موفقیت و مشارکت را ساخته اید ، شما هستید
تقویت زمینه برای آن مشارکت ، که زمینه "مشکلی وجود دارد". است ،
این برای همه روشن است؟ شرکت کننده (رهبر انجمن 8)
بنابراین من آنقدر احمق نخواهم بود که بپرسم چگونه از این مخمصه خارج شوم. درز
بله ، زیرا شما این کار را نمی کنید. شرکت کننده (رهبر انجمن 8)
من خیلی باهوش هستم حدس می زنم درز
می بینید: در مورد مرده بودن چه می کنید؟ (خنده)
هیچی ببینید این بد نیست که بدانید وقتی مرده اید مرده اید. دراز کشیده می دانید که در اتاق برخی از افراد مرده وجود دارند؟ در واقع برخی از مرده ها وجود دارند
در اینجا - قدم زدن در اطراف پیچ به صورت قائم ، هر چند مرده است. در اینجا افرادی هستند که کشته شده اند
خودشان آنها بدن خود را به قتل نرسانند ، آنها خودشان را کشتند. بدن آنها دور می رود اما
آنها مرده اند. در اینجا مردگان مرده اند. شما حتی ممکن است از این که مرده اید ، بدانید. این که
خبر خوبی خواهد بود زیرا در این صورت می توانید دراز بکشید و استراحت کنید. (خنده)
شرکت کننده (رهبر انجمن 9)
بنابراین یکی از شگفتی های من در این انجمن این است که دیروز دیدم که راکت من این است که من یک هستم
قربانی ... erhard
این بسیار تعجب آور است که از یک پسر مانند این شنیده می شود. مرد بسیار موفق ، بسیار توانا. شرکت کننده (رهبر انجمن 9)
و من همیشه قربانیان را دوست نداشته ام. بنابراین غیر از این ، بنابراین امشب برای شام ، بعد از سریال
جلساتی که من به پایان رسیدم که کسی نیست که با او به شام ​​برود و ویولن ها شروع می شوند
روز اول انجمن: جلسه چهارم
301
بیرون و به آنچه دیروز گفتید برای من درست شد که این من قربانی خود را اداره کردم
راکت لحظه ای به خودم خندیدم. و بعد من به برخی از افراد رفتم تا بروم
شام با درز
ببینید ، یک ثانیه نگه دارید. او کمی جلوتر از ما است. من تقریباً آرزو می کنم که او این حرف را نگفته باشد زیرا اکنون
او حقیقت را بیرون کشیده است ، و شما سریع به آن واقعی می پردازید. این میله های زندان جدید خواهد بود. وقتی متوجه شدید که خالی و بی معنی است ، چیزهایی را که قبلاً ندیده اید می بینید. تا زمانی که
همانطور که با اپرا صابون خود گیر کرده اید ، نمی توانید آن چیزها را ببینید. به عنوان مثال ، اگر شما هستید
این که مردم قادر نیستند ، شما نمی توانید فرصت های توسعه توانایی آنها را ببینید. و شما نمی توانید
توانایی آنها را ببینید. به محض این که این راکت شما است ، به محض اینکه این صابون را بدست آوردید
اپرا که شما باید همه کارها را انجام دهید زیرا هیچ کس به اندازه کافی قادر نیست
این کار را انجام دهید ، شما شروع به دیدن چیزهایی می کنید که قبلاً ندیده اید. حالا ، من نباید به شما می گفتم ، می بینید ،
از آنجا که شما تمام شب را صرف تلاش می کنید تا از نحوه خارج شدن از تله بیرون بیایند. و شما
فردا وارد اینجا شوید همه دوباره در دام گیر کرده اند. ما باید کل روز را صرف کنیم
شما از تله خارج می شوید. و سپس ما باید یک روز اضافی از انجمن را با همه شما انجام دهیم. برو جلو شرکت کننده (رهبر انجمن 9)
بنابراین من واقعاً نمی خواهم این سؤال را بپرسم. اما آنچه من بدست آورده ام ، و فقط برای به اشتراک گذاشتن ،
یکی این است که اخیراً مربیگری برخی از افراد برای من این است که خودم را کمی جدی بگیرم و من
اکنون می تواند اتاق را به این صورت بشنود. ثانیا ، آیا من توانسته ام خودم را با مردم به اشتراک بگذارم ،
ورنر ، مثل چیزی که اتفاق افتاده است. درز
خودش صحبت کند نه در سفارش. شرکت کننده (رهبر انجمن 9)
من می توانم به عنوان یک فارغ التحصیل ، عضو کارمند و کاندیدای رهبر انجمن ببینم ، که احتمالاً این است
چیزی برای همه ما ، اشتراک گذاری به صورت سفارش. درز
خوب ممنون (تشویق)
الکس
در مورد کودکی که به همه چیز گفته شده است ، چطور؟ درز
به آن "جعبه شیشه ای" اسکینر گفته می شود و اسکینر قبلاً نشان داد که این کار نمی کند. انجام داد
شما جواب من را می گیرید؟ الکس
بله "
به عنوان مثال ، اگر شما چه کسی هستید آن مردم است
قادر نیست ، شما نمی توانید فرصت ها را ببینید
برای توسعه توانایی آنها و شما نمی توانید
توانایی آنها را ببینید. به محض این که آن را دریافت کردید
این راکت شماست ، به محض اینکه دریافت کردید
آن اپرا کل صابون که به آن رسیده اید
همه کارها را انجام دهید زیرا وجود دارد
هیچ کس در اطراف آن به اندازه کافی قادر به انجام آن است ، شما
شروع به دیدن چیزهایی که قبلاً ندیده اید. 302
وجود
درز
پاسخ دیگر این است که شما واقعاً از آنچه اتفاق می افتد دریافت نمی کنید ، شما همیشه همیشه هستید
که به عنوان یک انسان به عبارت دیگر ، شما "اینجا مشکلی وجود دارد" در انتظار آن هستید
اتفاق می افتد اگر وقت داشتیم ، گوش دهید ، و ما این برنامه دیگر نیستیم - من بلند می شوم
به اندازه کافی افراد در اینجا که تجربه آنها تقریباً همیشه همان چیزی بود که شما و من مثبت می نامیدیم. بچه های ورزشکار ، بچه های موفق ، نوع مناسب خانواده ها. و شما از این نتیجه می گیرید
آنها به نوعی آن را لعنتی کرده بودند. شگفت انگیز است باور سخت در اینجا افرادی وجود دارند
آن بچه هایی که با آنها بزرگ شدیم که فکر می کردیم همه اینها را دارند. مردم این را در اینجا دوست دارند. و اگر آنها ایستادند
و با شما به اشتراک گذاشتند ، آنها به شما می گفتند که این بد است. الکس
بله درز
بنابراین هیچ راهی برای فرار از آن وجود ندارد. حتی اگر به شما گفته شده "شما فوق العاده هستید" ، "شما می توانید هر چیزی داشته باشید
شما می خواهید ، "" زندگی عالی است. " اکنون ، این ترجیح داده می شود که شما گه می کنید.
در مورد آن الکس
این سوال من است آیا این ارجح است؟ درز
اوه مطمئنا این نوع حمل چمدان کمتری است. شما هنوز هم می خواهید چمدان را حمل کنید. شما
هنوز هم وارد تله می شود. شما نمی توانید بچه های خود را از دام دور نگه دارید. الکس
به کودک گفته می شود "شما می توانید هر کاری را که می خواهید انجام دهید" ، یا والدین آن کودک را به همان اندازه بدست می آورند
متفاوت است که به کودک بگویید که آنها بی ارزش هستند. آیا در همان شافت آسانسور است ، یا متفاوت است؟ درز
این درست است من تا آنجا که می توانم آن را ببینم ، به آن نگاه کردم ، و بله. اما خیلی طولانی است که مکالمه
همین حالا لوسی
دو چیز یکی از این گفتگوها را برای من شخصاً قدرتمندترین دیدم. تجربیات
که شنیدم برای من بسیار کاربردی است. درز
شخصی خود را در اشتراک دیگران می شنود. لوسی
من فکر می کنم می فهمم که چرا من از بسیاری از مواردی که من ... روز سه بار: جلسه چهارم: جلسه چهار:
303
درز
مطمئناً زیرا شما یک فرد موفق هستید. لوسی
من سعی می کنم از چیزی جلوگیری کنم ، این احساس که چیزی اشتباه است. اما سوال بعدی که
به ذهن می آید این است که استراتژی fi x آن چیست؟ و شما گفتید که شما آن را نمی کنید. درز
نه شما نمی کنید. لوسی
اما من با آن موافق نیستم. درز
این طور نیست که شما با آن موافق نیستید. شما معتاد به آن هستید. لوسی
این درست است درز
شما باید یک جواب داشته باشید. لوسی
نه پاسخی ، بلکه راهی برای ساختن آن و سپس آن را می کند. درز
بله شما و سوزان باید با هم جمع شوید. این دو آجیل دستاورد هستند. شما نمی توانید از آن استفاده کنید. لوسی
چرا نه؟ درز
خوب ، شما به من می گویید که چگونه می توانم مرده باشم و من به شما می گویم که چگونه آن را انجام دهید. لوسی
خوب بسیاری از چیزها قاب ذهن یک شخص هستند و چگونه فکر می کنید چیزها ... erhard
این درست نیست بسیاری از موارد با استفاده از اصطلاحات قاب که از طریق آن توضیح داده می شود
شما به چیزها نگاه می کنید. مثل تفکر مثبت چیزهای خوب چه نوع شخصی نیاز دارد
مثبت فکر می کنید؟ لوسی
کسی که نوع منفی است 304
وجود
درز
بله هر بار که فکر می کنید مثبت است ، این محتوا است. زمینه منفی است ، شما هستید
یک شخص منفی زندگی منفی است. شوخی نکنید من تمام این کار دستاورد را انجام داده ام
مدتی با انجام این کار پول زیادی کسب کرد. پول زیادی آن کل تجارت در مورد بودن
موفق و دستیابی و تفکر مثبت. شما آن را نامگذاری کردم من آن را انجام دادم. و کار می کند. مشکل
این است که هرگز کافی نیست هرگز برآورده نمی شود ، هرگز کامل. آنچه از من می پرسید این است که چگونه بیرون بیایم
از تله و پاسخ این است که تلاش برای خارج شدن از تله چیزی است که شما را در دام نگه می دارد. من می خواهم که شما امشب به این فکر کنید. این کار سخت است. زیرا بیرون رفتن
شما بیرون در این حالت بیرون رفتن شما را نگه می دارد. این یک نوع زندان بسیار عجیب است. میله ها هستند
از آهن ساخته نشده است. آنها از تلاش برای خارج شدن از زندان ساخته شده اند. خیلی لوسی ، امشب ، من
می خواهید ببینید که آیا می توانید بپذیرید که می خواهید بقیه عمر خود را در آن زندگی کنید
این زندان لوسی
من یک سوال دیگر دارم مفهوم ... زندگی خالی است و ... erhard
من در مفاهیم صحبت نمی کنم. تمایزات لوسی
من سعی می کنم ارتباط برقرار کنم که چگونه می توانیم آن را در زندگی خود اعمال کنیم. درز
شما نمی توانید آن را اعمال کنید. اطلاعات بی فایده و بی فایده. لوسی
پس هدف دانستن این موضوع چیست؟ یا قبول آن؟ درز
زیرا این حقیقت است لوسی
اما چگونه می توان دانستن این موضوع یا پذیرش آن قدرت شخصی را برای ما ایجاد کرد؟ درز
خیلی عالی یک ثانیه را نگه دارید ، من دوباره برمی گردم. (به گروه)
من و لوسی قصد داریم به طور نهایی نشان دهیم که شما به جواب معتاد هستید ، که شما هستید
معتاد به بیرون آمدن ، برای دریافت جواب. این مهم نیست که چند بار می خواهم بگویم
شما که تلاش برای بیرون آمدن ، میله های زندان است ، می خواهید بقیه خود را صرف کنید
زندگی در تلاش برای بیرون آمدن او می خواهد همان چیزی را که من در مورد آن صحبت می کنم نشان دهد. او قصد دارد
نشان می دهد که او قصد دارد بقیه عمر خود را صرف تلاش برای بیرون آمدن کند. و چیزی که به او نمی گویم
قرار است جلوی او را بگیرد. هیچ پاسخی وجود ندارد شما بیرون نمی آیید این کار نمی کند این نیست
