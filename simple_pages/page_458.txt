Well, “I did the operation because I chose to.” You get in a lot of trouble that way. That’s not
responsible. Choice puts you into a certain relationship to life like “responsible for.” It shifts your 
relationship to what is. So now we need to do the real choice demo, right? So, all that stuff  we did? 
That wasn’t it. We’re close. We did the “getting up to this place” choice demonstration. We haven’t 
done the real one yet. There’s an illusion in the one we just did, which we are going to handle.

So we want to distinguish choice as choice. Okay, ready?

Chocolate. Choose.
ANDY
Chocolate.

Chocolate: How come you chose chocolate?
ANDY
Because I chose chocolate.
KIPP
Yeah. And what else was there?
ANDY
No choice at all...
KIPP
Was there anything else other than chocolate?
ANDY
Yes.
KIPP
Where? Chocolate: choose!
ANDY
I choose chocolate.
