So occurrence can be constitutive of distinguishing?
ERHARD
No. The other way around and constitutive is not the right word. Allowed by is better. Occur-
ring is allowed by the distinction in which it occurs. The occurring is possible by virtue of the
domain of possibility which you have established. For instance, the photographic image doesn’t
occur in the brain or in the eyes. Those were operational before. The occurring happens in a
“house called possibility.” Possibility is a product of an operation called distinguishing.

I have a sense that there’s an architecture, or whatever word you want to use, so that in order
to objectify something, you have to be able to locate it, someplace, sometime, some form, some
architecture for defi nition. Is there an architecture for distinguishing?
ERHARD
I’m not clear about your use of the word architecture.

Anatomy or elements.
ERHARD
At one end of the spectrum is design, at the other end is making. Anatomy is at the making
end. What’s up at the design end, mostly lives in what will remain unsaid. Although present by
virtue of... all that...

Is it possible to elevate or transform a concept to a distinction, and create a possibility?
ERHARD
That’s moving from anatomy to design. When you deal with distinction, with design, there’s
something inherently satisfying about that. There’s something inherently satisfying in master-
ing something, and mastery and distinction are synonymous.

Whatever it is, what are you going to use it for? To look good. The problem is, you can’t use dis-
tinctions. Distinctions use you, you don’t use them. Distinctions give you. Not many people own
a yellow car, right?  Buy a yellow car and see how many yellow cars you see. We’re developing
occurring as a new distinction. You got

may be as veiled as ever” (WCT 17). Therefore Heidegger says of
T
Socrates: “All through his life and right up to his death, Socrates
did nothing else than place himself into this draft , this current, and
maintain himself in it. That is why he is the purest thinker of the
West” (WCT 17).

The relationship of thinking to Being is easily conceived in
familiar Cartesian terms: “Being is the objective, the object. Think-
ing is the subjective, the subject. The relation of thinking to Being
is that of subject to object” (IM 150). Such a conception, however,
keeps us stuck in one of the primary dualities of metaphysical
thought. Heidegger finds an alternative view in a fragment from
the Greek thinker Parmenides: to gar auto noein estin te kai einai,
which has been translated, traditionally and (says Heidegger) inad-
equately, as “thinking and Being are the same” (IM 152). In fact, the
relation between thinking and Being is much subtler than simple
“identity,” and it is the development of the nature of this relation
which is at the center of Heidegger’s later thought. In Werner
Erhard’s work, this relation is explored persistently in the dialogue
of The Forum.
Heidegger emphasizes that the way to thinking is not think-
ing about thinking, a practice that has flourished in the West as
t
“logic” (WCT 21). Nor, even more fundamentally, is it the kind of
T
thinking which Nietzsche called “blinking,” the formation of ideas
which “present and propose of everything only the glitter, only the
appearance of surfaces and foreground facets” (WCT 82).
T
Merely having thoughts, for Heidegger, is “idea forming,”
and not at all what is involved in true thinking: “We understand,
of course, and consider it the most obvious thing in the world,
when someone says, ‘I think the matter is such and such,’ and
with it has in mind, ‘I have such and such an idea of the matter’”
(WCT 45). But we have not yet really thought what is involved
T
in idea-forming. That is, we have thought of “idea forming”
as “thinking,” but we have not yet thought of idea-forming as
idea-forming, that is, as a distinct mode of thinking. Thus we
have not thought something which is determinative of our very
existence:

SPEAKING BEING
THEODORE
How do you distinguish something without defi ning it?
ERHARD
Yeah. We’re going to get to that.
THEODORE
I got something about looking good. In being here I want this to be successful, and one of my
fears is not looking good, going home and seeing that nothing happened.
ERHARD
You’re not free and that will keep something from happening. So when you’re willing to be with
one of the possible outcomes–that nothing will happen–then you’re in a place where something
can happen to you. You see how strange that sounds? By being willing to have nothing happen
you are in a place where something can happen. Thanks.
(Theodore sits down)
Distinction is an operation in language. In the normal course of events, you and I think of
language as something we use to report on something. Language is for talking
t
about. It’s for
abouting. Describing and explaining are operations in language called reporting. We think that
there’s something out there that has a particular way it is, and I make a representation of it. And
if my representation is accurate, I can make it work. But now we’re distinguishing a new kind
of operation in language. It’s an operation in language called generating. It’s as though I said
“chair” and a chair came out of my mouth. Watch. You’re going to see this thing fall out of my
mouth as I say it: I promise. When I said “promise,” what fell out of my mouth was a promise.
When I say “I promise,” that’s a promise, isn’t it? What falls out of my mouth when I say “I
promise”? A promise. When I say “I promise,” a promise falls out of my mouth. All I want you to
see is there’s possibility in language that didn’t occur to you, because you hadn’t distinguished
language as a generative act. So we’re sneaking up on the answer to the question: what is the
operation by which one distinguishes? Not an operation in language like reporting, but creating.
Listen up. Apes are not stupid. But no ape has ever picked up a stick along a path because he
needed to knock down bananas. Why not? Because apes live in a world with no possibility; be-
cause they live without language. And I don’t mean laboratory apes. Laboratory apes are tainted
with language.
LOUISE
What about the hundredth monkey?
ERHARD
It’s totally false, that example. It’s bullshit, and demonstrated to be so. The author has acknowl-
edged that he wrote that to make a point. Lyall-Watson recanted that as scientifi c evidence. I
want to stop hearing that crap about the hundredth monkey.
That is, idea-forming shapes us, and thus “the essence of
idea-forming is probably the first thing that must be put into
the language of thinking” (WCT 55). This is the first step in the
T
appropriation of our current way of thinking: the recognition
and taking-over of that thinking, which is necessary before we
can attain a possibility beyond it.
This aspect of Heidegger’s thinking has been central through-
out its evolution, emerging in various iterations, from the reso-
luteness of Dasein in Being and Time to the gentler releasement
of his later work. It is also a central element in Werner Erhard’s
methodology. Both men posit the paradoxical idea that, rather
than resisting those aspects of ourselves that we see as in some
way problematic, we let them be, and own them, and thereby gain
a freedom to think beyond them. The idea is fundamental to the
transformation that both men are working to make available. ■
One might say, for instance: “I think it will
snow tonight.” But he who speaks that way is
not thinking, he just has views on something.
We must be very careful, however, not to
regard this “viewing” as insignificant. All our
daily life and all we do moves within what we
have in view, and necessarily so. (WCT 32)
