Forum Day Three: Session Four

KEVIN
Sure.
ERHARD
Thanks.
KEVIN
Where was I? I was going to share my breakthrough.
ERHARD
You were going to share your “guess” breakthrough.
KEVIN
Now I’m not even sure what a breakthrough is. In any case, I feel like something happened. I
don’t know.
WES
I don’t want to hear that. You’re either going to say there was a breakthrough, or you’re going to
say there wasn’t a breakthrough. But there’s no guessing. There’s no maybe. There’s no place to
look.
KEVIN
I had a breakthrough because something new and diff erent was happening to me that I hadn’t
experienced before.
WES
No, you had a breakthrough because you say so.
ERHARD
Kevin, breakthrough is a declaration phenomenon. Do you know the meaning of assertion? The
commonplace meaning of assertion?
KEVIN
Yes.
ERHARD.
Breakthrough is not an assertion.
KEVIN
Okay.
ERHARD
It’s a declaration.

SPEAKING BEING
KEVIN
Okay.
ERHARD
It’s a stand one takes in the matter. That’s what Wes is discussing with you, to put it in more
technical language.
KEVIN
Okay.
ERHARD
That’s what he means when he says “It’s whatever you say it is.”
KEVIN
Okay.
ERHARD
Like a declaration.
KEVIN.
My breakthrough was my racket, fi nding my racket, which was standing right in front of me all
the time, was that I have to do everything: Every goddamned thing in the world for everybody. I
even have to run this Forum for you.
(laughter)
Now there’s going to be some people laughing, but as The Forum went along, I realized that I
was running The Forum because The Forum wasn’t working out the right way for me, so I was
having to make adjustments in The Forum so it was working out right for me. And so I made
those adjustments. When I wanted to go to the bathroom, I went to the bathroom. And I tried to
come on time, but I was late a couple of times, so I guess that means that I didn’t really try.
WES
No it means you were late.
KEVIN (laughing)
Sorry I said that.
ERHARD
You did try.
KEVIN
Okay. I have to do everything because everybody around me is ineff ective. And I am very good
at it. I can do anything. Fix this, make sure everything gets done, and I can’t let anybody do
anything for me. And I was aware of this, but I never saw this was such a dominant feature of
my life as I did until today. At that point it leaves my mind blank.
