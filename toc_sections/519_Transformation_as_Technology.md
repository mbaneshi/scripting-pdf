Forum Day Four: Session Three 505
ERHARD (continuing to laughter)
That’s you. You’re “oh shit!” That’s how we know when you got back.
(laughter; indicating third empty circle)
So a lot of what the second half of The Forum is about is access to this domain. And you and I
are not going to do as good a job at access to that domain as you were getting to zero, because
you all were a pain in the ass and it took too long to get to zero. If you didn’t hear me making
you wrong, I was just making you wrong.
(laughter)
The other side of that is that we haven’t gotten our shit together to get The Forum to zero
quickly enough to do a good job on the second half. That’s making me wrong. You notice
nothing changes, no matter who’s wrong?
(laughter and applause)
The point is that we can’t do very much more than open up the second half of The Forum.
That’s as much as we can get done, because you all need your beauty sleep.
(laughter)
Okay, so what is this domain? If it’s not experiential, and it isn’t; it’s not conceptual, and it isn’t:
What is that domain?
(writing “possibility” in the third circle)
Simple. It’s the domain of possibility. Not this possibility or that possibility,
(indicating the “story” circle)
...that’s here. You could say that it’s the possibility of possibility. But there’s no such domain.
No matter where you go to look for it you can’t fi nd it. You can’t have it unless you invent it.
You have to invent the possibility of possibility. You want to listen to that. People don’t have
possibility in their lives. They have options. Options are futures generated from the past. The
past could work out like this, or it could work out like that. You know, common conversation
between people. Things could work out like this, or they could work out like that. “They’re
likely to work out like this, but oh boy would I love them to work out like that, but that is
not very likely.” That is not possibility; that is “options.” Options are conceptual. And your
experience—listen up—your experience will mostly be limited to the options that you give
yourself to experience. It’s the vicious circle all over again.
(indicating the “story” circle)
The options are here. Why do I call them options? Because they’re derived from your past
experiences! The options shape your future experience. And the option-shaped experiences
reinforce the options. So now you fi nally got yourself fi gured out so you don’t need to get
up in the morning anymore, because there’s nowhere to go. Why bother? You already know
how it’s going to be, so why bother? The only reason why most of you get up is because you
506
SPEAKING BEING
like suff ering. That’s a psychiatric problem called masochism. Go to a psychiatrist to get that
handled. We don’t handle that in here. But most of you get up because you like suff ering. I
mean, you must like suff ering: That’s what you do. And you know you’re going to do it. No,
what gets you up is hoping, hoping you’re going to make it, hoping it’s all going to work out,
hoping it’s somehow going to be diff erent, hoping you’re going to get the answer. What’s that?
(in response to a participant calling out, Erhard repeats)
Yeah. You suff er hoping. Exactly. Hoping keeps you suff ering. Why would you bother getting up
in the morning if you know what it’s going to be like?
(walking back to the chalkboard to indicate the “possibility” circle)
At any rate, you’ve got something to say here. You’ve got nothing to say about experience—you
can only report on it more or less accurately.
(indicating the “story” circle)
And you’re limited to what you say here reporting on experience. This is reporting on that.
(indicating the “possibility” circle)
Here you are free. Now, there’s one little catch. A pipe dream is not a possibility. Pipe dreams
and possibility are not the same thing. Possibility is the future. You could say that the past could
have possibly been like this. But in the future, we might learn that the past was really diff erent
than what we thought. Possibility is always future. It’s got that kind of temporality: future. And
you’re going to have pipe dreams and call them possibility. I’ll tell you how to tell the diff erence
between a pipe dream and possibility. There is no future, which will ever be realized, which is
not an extension of the past when it happens. All futures will be an extension of the past. There
are no discontinuous futures. Not in your lifetime, because all futures, when realized, have a
continuity with the past. There is nothing that ever happened that was inconsistent with the
past. If necessary, the past is rewritten. On the basis of Columbus and Einstein, the past was
rewritten. See, it was true the world was fl at, until someone did something inconsistent with
that. Then we said, oh, it wasn’t fl at. How the hell do you know it wasn’t fl at? The point is that
you’re free to create possibilities for your life and you want to ground those possibilities by
bringing the possibility back into the present. Like standing in the future to create a future. And
then you tease it back to the present, so there’s a structure to fulfi ll that possibility. But that’s too
technical, and we don’t have the time to go into all the technicalities tonight. All I’m going to
tell you is this: If you live with possibility, you live with both risk and power. None of this works;
it’s only empowering. None of this is the answer, and it is empowering. Life is authentically
risky. You got the wrong idea about life. You think life is about reducing the risk with fi nding the
answers. You want to cheat. If you want to reduce the risk, play tennis with three-year-olds. You
win all the time. Makes you feel great.
(laughter)
If winning all the time makes you feel great then you like playing tennis with three-year-olds.
Winning doesn’t make people feel great. Being powerful and able and playing and dancing,
that makes people feel great. And to do that you’ve got to have power, and that’s what we’re
ERHARD (continuing)
All I’m going to tell you is this: If you live with
possibility, you live with both risk and power.
None of this works; it’s only empowering. None
of this is the answer, and it is empowering. Life
is authentically risky.
“
Forum Day Four: Session Three 507
talking about here: What we’re talking about here is empowering yourself, not reducing the
risk. We’re not talking about giving you the answers so that you know how to beat people; it
just reduces life and people to a three-year-old. That’s silly. If the point was getting to the top of
Mount Everest, some goddamn entrepreneur would put an elevator on it. The question is: How
powerful and how able can you be in the face of the risk called Mount Everest?
(pausing)
Okay. So we’re almost home. We’ve got two more defi nite steps. And the fi rst step is a step
called responsibility. Remember the choice exercise? You discovered something about choice
that was inconsistent with the interpretation you already had that choice was, and that there’s
a certain power to distinguishing choice the way you distinguished it during the exercise. Same
thing about responsibility. The fi rst thing you want to get is, responsibility is not blame or guilt
or fault. When I say I’m responsible, I’m not saying I did it, or I am to blame or that I’m guilty.
When I say I’m responsible, what I mean is that I stand for being cause in the matter. Not “I
caused it.” It’s a stand for being cause in the matter.
(indicating the “possibility” circle)
And you can’t take a stand without this domain. Without this domain, your stand is a mere
position. Some position you’ve taken on the matter. I don’t know if you’ve been watching this
over the past four days, but your positions have gotten you into a lot of hot water. Your positions
have ruined your life a little bit. Or a whole lot.
(pausing)
Without this domain... See, a possibility is established by taking a stand for something as a
possibility. A position is established by setting something up as something toward which you
are working. Possibility is something you are free to realize, which is diff erent than something
you are working towards. It’s like you’re free to realize whatever it is that you’re willing to stand
for. That’s diff erent from working towards something. Can you imagine: Working toward hitting
the ball over the net in tennis does not make great tennis? Or working toward dancing. My
mother only made one mistake in raising me. She sent me to the Bala Cynwyd Women’s Club to
learn to dance. This was a big mistake.
(laughter)
Knowing where to put your feet is not dancing. I didn’t know that for a long time.
(indicating the “possibility” circle)
The action in this realm is declaration.
(indicating the “story” circle)
The action in this realm is assertion.
(indicating the “what happened” circle)
The action here is expressives. These are Speech Acts, but that’ll get too complicated. To
understand declaration, you have to go to an umpire convention.
See, a possibility is established by taking a
stand for something as a possibility. A position
is established by setting something up as some-
thing toward which you are working. Possibil-
ity is something you are free to realize, which
is diff erent than something you are working
towards. It’s like you’re free to realize whatev-
er it is that you’re willing to stand for. That’s
diff erent from working towards something.

SPEAKING BEING
Here Erhard told the story about the three umpires: the rookie umpire who said he “calls them like
they are,” the experienced umpire who said he calls them “like I see them,” and the master umpire,
who said “They ain’t anything until I call them something.”
ERHARD
That’s declaration. See, the umpire’s got the power of declaration. What is it? If President Carter
wakes up in the middle of the night, says “to hell with glasnost, I’m sending the bombs out,”
what does Rosalynn say? “Shut up, Jimmy, go to sleep.” But if President Bush does it, Barbara
runs for the bomb shelter. Actually, the president doesn’t do that, but never mind; it ruins the
story if I go into that. This power of declaration: That’s what it takes to be responsible, because
being responsible is merely a declaration. It is the declaration that one is cause in the matter. It’s
not a description of the case. It’s not a report on the facts: It’s a place to stand in life regarding
what you care about. When I’m in India, I say the people who are hungry are responsible for
their hunger. And the bleeding hearts have a problem with that. But I’ll tell you, if you are
responsible for your hunger you’re a lot more powerful than if you’re a victim of being hungry.
It’s quite clear to me that the hungry do not want to be hungry, and the hungry would not
have it that way if they had the opportunity to do something about it. It’s quite clear to me that
it takes more courage to live one day there than it takes for me to live ten years. But treating
people as if they have no responsibility is disempowering to people. Now you can’t argue that
you’re responsible, because that’s not a declaration, is it? That’s an assertion, an argument. A
declaration has to be done freely, not coerced. You’ve got to have the power of declaration, and
the power of declaration is a product of freedom. It’s a privilege to be responsible, not a burden
to be responsible. “I am cause in the matter” is a stand for giving yourself power, not a report
on the facts or the circumstances. It’s clear to me that I’m the cause in the matter of people’s
hunger. I make that declaration; it gives me power with regard to the issue of hunger. It’s not a
report on the fact that I did it. It’s a place to stand from which one has power. If it’s not my fault,
if I didn’t do it—but none of that interests me—whose fault is it? Somebody gets to be wrong
and somebody gets to be right. That’s the point.
(indicating the “possibility” circle)
The realm of possibility is also the realm of responsibility. Most people are never going to be
responsible because that realm doesn’t exist; you have to invent it. One of the things we haven’t
told you is what you’re going to get out of being in The Forum. Listen up! What you’re going to
get out of The Forum—yeah you’re going to get a lot of nice things and good things, but that’s
all chicken shit. What you’re really going to get out of The Forum is whatever you’re willing to
stand for having gotten out of The Forum. You’re not going to get out of The Forum what we
gave you because we can’t give you anything of value. You know, all these people are not here
because we have something valuable to give to people. You can’t get anything valuable from
other people. Like “be given it.” Chicken shit is what we get from one another. But you can give
yourself something valuable. You can give yourself something extraordinarily valuable. You
can give yourself something that will last the rest of your life. You can give yourself something
that will make it that your life is never the same. So here’s my promise: I promise that you can
have anything out of The Forum you’re willing to stand for having gotten. I also promise you
What you’re really going to get out of The
Forum is whatever you’re willing to stand for
having gotten out of The Forum.
“
Forum Day Four: Session Three 509
won’t get anything else out of The Forum that’s worth anything. What you’ll get out of your
participation in The Forum is what you’re willing to stand for having gotten. You don’t get
what you’re checking to see if you’ve gotten...” Let me see, what happened to me? Did my mind
change? Did my feelings change? Did my eyesight change? Am I taller? Am I thinner? Do I
feel better?” You can’t have any of that. If you’re willing to stand for having been empowered
in here, you can walk out of here empowered. That’s the truth. This isn’t some airy-fairy crap.
You are not the fi rst people I have done this work with. This is grounded on a lot of evidence.
You paid your $625. You bust your ass for four days, you still got one evening to go. Whatever
possibility you’re willing to stand for, whatever conversation for possibility you’re willing to
generate, that’s what you will have gotten. Whatever possibility you’re willing to stand for, that’s
what you can have. What you’ve done in here has given you the power to realize what you’re
willing to stand for, not like a formula, but like a possibility in which you can act and be. Not
like a guaranteed outcome, not like playing tennis with a three-year-old; being fully at risk, but
being fully empowered in the face of the risk. If you don’t like risk, you don’t like life. So we’re
up to the last thing now. Kind of. I say kind of because I never know what’s really last. Who has
any questions?
A participant raised his hand.
RICHARD
I got what I paid my money for. What has happened in the last few months is that my projects
have become so successful that they’re bigger than my possibility for them.
ERHARD
You hear what he said? He used up the world of possibility. The content has overwhelmed
the context. He’s created a possibility and has related to that possibility powerfully enough,
with the power to fulfi ll the possibility such that the content is overwhelming the context.
You know what a hero is? Not what you think a hero is. A hero is not some dashing fi gure, an
extraordinary person. Only ordinary people can be heroes. A hero is an ordinary person who
dares to recognize and accept the call of a possibility bigger than themselves. Real simple.
A hero is an ordinary person who sees, who hears, who is open to, and accepts the call of a
possibility bigger than themselves, or herself or himself.
CECILIA
I’ve accomplished a lot and I’m an artist and illustrator. I’ve done book publishing, and so all
this work is sixty percent solitary at least, and I’ve been having this conversation for years that
I ought to go participate with other people. And so once and a while I go do that from “ought
to.” I’ve done some good things but in the end I say “Jeez! That was a mistake. I wish I had done
that by myself after all.” I mean the nurturing is kind of awful out here and I’ve been doing this
work for years going in and out of that. And what I fi nally got these last four days was that it’s
never going to work if I think I have to go and do it. It’s like “Gee, I already like this thing I’m
doing: painting. It’s meaningless, so I’ll just do it!” But I also got that I had killed off  one of the
main human attributes, which was love.

SPEAKING BEING
CECILIA (continuing; breaking into tears)
What I can do now is go out and be with you all from my love for you all, rather than because I
think I ought to.
ERHARD
Very nice.
(applause)
HENRY
I’m speaking and listening and it’s like the fi rst time. I’ve been stingy and this is the fi rst time
that I’m not. I called my father and my mother. I told them that I loved them and they told me
they loved me. I told them they were okay by me. My father said, “Well that’s interesting!” I
asked him if I was okay by him and he said “Sure you’re okay by me.” My relationships with my
mother and father are complete. I say so.
ERHARD
By the way: They are if you say so. Not like you want to say so. You’ve got to be free to say so.
You can’t say so in-order-to. You’ve got to be standing where what you say is so. We’ll talk about
that in a moment. Please go on.
HENRY
Everything that I’ve accomplished in my thirty-two years of my life is empty and meaningless. I’m
okay with that. My life is perfect. What’s happened for me in the last several days is... I’m standing
here trembling in awe and respect and gratitude for the incredible space of listening that you’ve
created. I’m expressing myself for the fi rst time. The parts of The Forum that have been diffi  cult
for me—I’m going through The Forum thinking I’m the only one going through this. But I’ve
seen myself in everybody’s share and it hasn’t been diffi  cult or painful. It’s been great. I’ve gotten
it: My back pain is gone, the stuff y nose is gone. I’ve got beyond the fi ve-year-old. I was that “I
can’t remember beyond fi ve-years-old.” I don’t know whether I’m remembering what happened
or remembering the story, but I’ve started to remember when I was very young. And what that
frees up for me: I couldn’t own what was invisible to me. The racket, which came from incidents
that were invisible to me and blocked out from me, kept coming up, and the incidents were so
far back, way earlier than I’ve ever looked before. Even though I’ve done the training before, I’ve
never experienced what I have now. I’ve always shared to look good, and now I’m sharing to
contribute. I feel like the amount of time that people will listen to me is very short, and so I speak
fast, cram it all in and nobody gets it. And I’m just worse off  afterwards. It was an in-order-to.
ERHARD
Say what’s there instead of talking about it. I didn’t say, “say it fast,” I said “say what’s there.”
You may have already said what you stood up to say, which is “I love you. And I respect you.
And I acknowledge you.” If you’ve got something beyond that to say, say it. But get to the punch
line. If you’re going to talk, do it eff ectively.
The Oblivion of Oblivion
As we stated earlier, Heidegger’s perspective on technology is an
important element in the understanding of Werner Erhard’s work
that we are developing here. Dreyfus finds a useful summary of
this perspective in the response of HAL, the computer/robot in
Forum Day Four: Session Three 511
HENRY
My promise is that the twenty-fi ve year racket that I’ve lived—I’m giving that up and am now
living out the distinction ecological health. I appreciate you very much, and I love you all.
ERHARD
Okay good. Thank you.
ZELDA
What do you mean: to stand for?
ERHARD
Declare the possibility of...; live out of the possibility of...; have as the context for living, the
possibility of...; Generate a conversation for...; create a context for...
ZELDA
I understand that. It says to me to be generous.
ERHARD
I’m not asking you to be generous. You will be generous if you do that. I’m not asking you to be
generous, because that would mean for you to have a quality inside yourself called generous.
If you act on the off er to have anything out of The Forum you are willing to stand for having
gotten... if you act on the off er you will be being generous. Generosity arises in an act of being.
It’s not a property inside of people that gets expressed in their actions. You get that?
ZELDA
Yes. Thank you.
(applause)
WALT
I say I’m not confused about what you’ve given us in the last hour, but it is a lot to hold.
ERHARD
Yes, precisely, so listen up here. This is good. I read something to you three days ago and I want
you to hear it again. See if it occurs for you diff erently than it did then.
Here, he read again the passage from the Heidegger/Japanese dialogue in Heidegger’s On the Way to
Language.
ERHARD (reading)
“We Japanese do not think it strange if a dialogue leaves undefi ned what is really intended, or
even restores it back to the keeping of the undefi nable.” ... “That is part of every dialogue that
has turned out well among thinking beings. As if of its own accord it can take care that that
undefi nable something not only does not slip away, but displays its gathering power ever more
Stanley Kubrick’s film 2001, when he asked whether he is happy:
“I’m using all my capacities to the maximum. What more could a
rational entity want?” This, says Dreyfus, is “a brilliant expression
of what anyone would say who is in touch with our current
understanding of Being.”
Of particular relevance is Dreyfus’ observation that “the
human potential movement perfectly expresses this technological
understanding of Being” (“Gaining”). Werner Erhard’s work, which
Peter Marin has called “the logical extension of the whole human
potential movement” (“The New Narcissism,” Harper’s Magazine,
October 1975, 47), may therefore be considered as a representative
manifestation of our current technological understanding of
Being, especially to the degree that this logical extension is
itself, paradoxically, a denial of the so-called human potential
movement. This point is central to the conclusion we are moving
toward here.
The situation: humans are always subjected to understandings
of Being, and to the way they play themselves out over time. In
Dreyfus’ words, “We don’t produce the clearing; The clearing
produces us” (“Gaining”). Every historical epoch is characterized
by a particular mode of unconcealment, a particular way in which
Being shows itself, so that in each epoch humans are given a
particular way to be. Through this epochal self-revealing, this
giving of itself to humans, Being manifests its nature; and beings
show up being that way, “the way they wound up being,” as Erhard
might say more recently.
But as Western thought has evolved over time, human beings
have lost their awareness of Being, if ever they have even been
aware of Being. Now, of the giver-giving-given event that is Being’s
gift , we see only the given, and we see it only as it is represented by
beings. Being “withdraws in favor of the gift  which It gives” (OTB 8).
When a giver withdraws and holds itself back, and gives only
its gift , that giving is appropriately called sending (OTB 8). The
gift  is given, but the sender, crucially, is not present. So while an
experience of Being is no longer available, the sending continues
to shape human existence in every age. This is the process which
Heidegger calls the destining of Being, and from this destining

SPEAKING BEING
luminously in the course of the dialogue.” The Japanese inquirer said “Our dialogues with our
teacher failed to turn out so well. Us younger men challenged him much too directly to satisfy
our thirst for handy information.” ... “Thirst for knowledge and greed for explanations never
lead to a thinking inquiry. Curiosity is always the concealed arrogance of a self-consciousness
that banks on a self-invented rationality.”
(to the group)
You remember I told you that that means we treat anything worth knowing as something
that merely extends from what we already know and that if we don’t immediately understand
something it must be bullshit.
(continuing to read)
“The will to know does not will to abide in hope before what is worthy of thought.”
(to the group)
What you and I just spoke about in the last two hours is worth standing in front of. You may not
get it all, which means you may not understand it all, which really means you may not be able
to apply it all, and your applying it will only denigrate it anyhow. Much better to stand with it,
to be with it.
WALT
So I’m way beyond what I understood before. I’m standing on a beach ball here, ready to lose
my balance. But it’s a good place to be. I understood you to tell us that the forwarding of this is
in declaration, that declaration is the way to access this?
ERHARD
Declaration is the action out of which possibility is generated: the speech act out of which
possibility is generated; it’s the name of the speech act out of which possibility arises.
WALT
So that’s what a person can do, in doing, to work with this.
ERHARD
Yeah, to generate a possibility. Precisely.
WALT
But the possibility, this possibility that’s created, is itself not useful, or applicable, but it sounds
“opportunity” somehow gets created.
ERHARD
There’s an opening. A freedom. There’s a freedom for that which you have declared possible. It
doesn’t mean you will—it means that there’s a freedom for that which you’ve declared possible,
that your actions may arise inside that possibility, and that your actions will arise inside that
possibility. We’re not done yet. We’ve got one last step to take.
“the essence of all history is determined” (“QCT” in BW 329). Here
Dreyfus recounts the historical record:
In the Christian age, everything showed up as
God’s creation, and showed up in terms of its
nearness or distance from God’s own nature.
In the modern age, everything showed up as
either a subject with a deep essence, or an ob-
ject with fixed properties. In the technological
age, by contrast, everything shows up in light
of what will allow us to put it to “the greatest
possible use at the lowest expenditure.” (Com-
panion to Heidegger 13)
“
Heidegger refers to this historical evolution of destining as the
play of Being. Being holds itself back in a particular way in each
epoch, and it is in the progress of the epochs that the play of Being
is manifested. The order of that play defies human understanding
and control: “The sequence of epochs in the destiny of Being is not
accidental, nor can it be calculated as necessary” (OTB 9). It plays.
Therefore enframing can be seen from one perspective as the
essence of modern technology, while from another it is simply the
particular clearing for unconcealment which the play of Being has
sent at this moment in history.
At this point, the reader may notice herself thinking some
version of “So what?” Yes, we can see the eff ects of technology
in our world. We overuse our gadgets and texting while driving is
dangerous and our interpersonal eye contact is suff ering.
But at the same time global communication and the conveniences
of everyday living have improved exponentially, and marginalized
groups around the globe have found a voice through social media
that have also shaken the foundations of local, national, and world
politics. Every advance brings its challenges. We can deal with it.
Perhaps. Certainly, the advantages are undeniable. But the
threat embedded in technology’s essence may make this one
advance too far. With each development in the play of Being, we
are moving farther and farther from the possibility of an originary
experience of Being: “The epochs overlap each other in their
ERHARD (continuing to read)

WALT
Okay. I’m just trying to handle the steps I’ve taken.
ERHARD
You’re doing the right thing. Go ahead.
WALT
In the previous days here, I’ve been able to get outside of myself. The meaninglessness, and
the meaninglessness of that, was a further push out of myself. And it’s an exciting place to be
for action. I have a concern that this will just remain potential. And I want to use it as soon as
possible so that it does not remain potential, or just a memory.
ERHARD
Your actions will be consistent with it remaining a potential, and consistent with your avoiding
that.
WALT
So I will not avoid that.
ERHARD
I don’t know. I just said your actions would be consistent with the occurring you created.
WALT
Okay. So I say...
ERHARD
Relax. See, relax. All you got to do is be here. Real simple. All you got to do is be here. This stuff
works. It actually works.
WALT
But it’s too great just to let it sit.
ERHARD
No, it’s so great you’ve got to let it sit. All you’ve got to do is take a stand for anything you want
to get out of The Forum.
WALT
Yeah but me... get out of The Forum, it’s puny compared to what you’ve put on the board.
ERHARD
I didn’t say “you,” like limiting it to you, like you, individually. “One can give...” Is that better?
sequence so that the original sending of Being as presence is more
and more obscured in diff erent ways” (OTB 9).
Therefore Heidegger makes his case in the strongest
possible terms: it is not just that our technological way of being is
distancing and impersonal. It is that once we lose ourselves in the
system, we may not be able to find our way out. As the Cartesian
subject, the self-certain lord of the earth, we encountered our
subjective truth in every objective being. But enframed as
resources for technology, “precisely nowhere does man today
any longer encounter himself, i.e., his essence” (“QCT” in BW 332).
We might begin to detect in Heidegger’s discourse the hint of a
persistent complaint reaching a fever pitch:
Enframing does not simply endanger man in
his relationship to himself and to everything
that is. As a destining, it banishes man into the
kind of revealing that is an ordering. Where this
ordering holds sway, it drives out every other
possibility of revealing. [. . .]
The rule of enframing threatens man with the
possibility that it could be denied to him to en-
ter into a more original revealing and hence to
experience the call of a more primal truth. Thus
where enframing reigns, there is danger in the
highest sense. (“QCT” in BW 332–333)
“
The culmination: what has been lost is forgotten.
Enframing disguises even this, its disguising, just
as the forgetting of something forgets itself and
is drawn away in the wake of forgetful oblivion.
The coming-to-pass of oblivion not only lets fall
from remembrance into concealment; but that
falling itself falls simultaneously from remem-
brance into concealment, which itself also falls
away in that falling. (“TT” in QCT 46)

SPEAKING BEING
WALT
It is... for me.
ERHARD
You have to free yourself, not limit yourself. You want to limit yourself: That’s what you want to
do—you want to limit yourself to be sure. You don’t want to take the risk of letting yourself be
free inside the possibilities you create. You want to limit your actions to make sure you realize
your goal. That is not this course. That’s a “Success” course.
WALT
So if I’m going to stay with it here, stay on board, really...
ERHARD
Give yourself some freedom. Create the possibility and then operate out of that possibility.
Operate on what? Whatever the hell’s in front of you, do whatever you do. Stop complicating
it. You’re back in the fi rst day now. You’re asking how to proceed. You’re asking for the
prescription. You go left and then you go right, that’s how you get there; but the real way to
get there is going wherever you’re going. Do whatever you’re doing. Don’t do what you’re not
doing. It’s real easy to follow that instruction.
WALT
And that’s enough?
ERHARD
That’s enough. Who would tell a guy like you that what you need to do is to box yourself in? The
degree to which you need to be boxed in is the degree to which you need to be narrowed. You’re
going to handle that without any help from anybody. Don’t you understand, Walt, I’m not going to
tell you: “Walt, what has to happen is that the sun’s gotta come up tomorrow morning!” That’s going
to happen anyhow. You don’t need to take my time, and I don’t need to take your time to have that
discussion. You don’t need to take our time to have the discussion you want to have, you’re going to
do that anyhow. You’ll get enough of that mixed into the stew. You’ll take care of that. You’re thrown
to that.
WALT
Yeah I am.
ERHARD
Yeah, you’re thrown to that. We don’t talk about what you’re thrown to. It’s not that we don’t
need what you’re thrown to. We do, but why talk about it? We’re going to get that anyhow.
WALT
I was trying to address something else. I was trying to address what you put out there.
At this point, for Heidegger, we let slip our own essential
role as the beings with meaning, the beings for whom Being is an
issue, the clearing in the world for beings to be the beings they
are. “Being’s coming to presence needs the coming to presence
of man, in order to remain kept safe as Being. . .” (“TT” in QCT 38).
But as enframing, we forfeit our role as safekeeper. Lost in the
machinations of the cybernetic system, we not only let the truth of
Being fall into oblivion, but we let fall into oblivion the knowledge
that we have done so, until finally, oblivion itself is forgotten,
and we forget that anything has been lost. “The most profound
oblivion,” says Heidegger, “is not-recollecting” (EP 63).
As evidence that this is already the condition in our world, we
cite the diff iculty that is inevitably encountered in any discussion
of Being, for example, the recurring sense in reading this book of
“What the hell are we talking about?” Being in our time, so goes
Heidegger’s persistent complaint, cannot be recollected, let alone
spoken. ■
Forum Day Four: Session Three 515
ERHARD
You’re trying to address what I put out there using your approach. And you need a little bit of
your approach. But we don’t need to discuss that; you’ll come up with that with your genius
in that quarter. You don’t need to discuss that with me. What you need to do is create the
possibility and to let yourself be free in the possibility. All the rest of it you’re thrown to.
WALT
Okay, so create the possibility.
ERHARD
Yeah, that’s what I said. You can have anything out of The Forum you can stand for having
gotten. “Stand for having gotten” and “create the possibility” are synonymous.
WALT
And that’s the declaration.
ERHARD
Yeah. That’s: generate a conversation for.
WALT
So if I don’t screw with that, it’s going to be all right.
ERHARD
Yeah, just handle that... No, I don’t know whether it’s going to be all right. All I know is that
you’re going to have power in the face of the risk that life is. That’s all I promised you. I didn’t
promise you things would be all right. I promised you the power and ability. I don’t know about
all right.
WALT
Thanks, Werner.
ERHARD
Yes, you’re welcome.
(applause)
Bill? Stand up.
Bill stood, the participant from the chocolate/vanilla demonstration, who also confronted Erhard on
the fi rst day of The Forum concerning being pressured to be in the course.
(continuing)
It’s called equal time, Bill. It’s called “only fair.”
