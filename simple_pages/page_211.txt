Forum Day Three: Session One Interval 
197
For Heidegger . . . the deepest meaning of a text is ‘concealed’ within it, for what a 
text has to say is ‘unspoken’ in it.” This is why Heidegger’s interpretations appear 
“outrageous” and “scandalous,” says Caputo: Heidegger hears a “primal address,” 
“the power of the first word” (The Mystical Element in Heidegger’s Thought 170).
It is also useful, given the emphasis that Heidegger’s later thinking placed on 
the generative nature of the language of poetry, to consider this passage from his 
analysis of the Anaximander fragment, considered “the oldest fragment of Western 
thinking”: “Thinking of Being is the original way of poetizing. . . . Because it poetizes 
as it thinks, the translation which wishes to let the oldest fragment of thinking itself 
speak necessarily appears violent” (EGT 19).
Thus Heidegger may be seen in his exploration of Greek thinking to be weaving 
a linguistic and poetic tapestry, threaded throughout with ambiguity, but a tapestry 
to which his entire thought is devoted: the language of Being, which is already 
always in language. If language is “the house of Being,” the question of Being is 
necessarily implicit in every question and yet at the same time always beyond 
language: “Being remains unthought” (“LH” in BW 242). 
His etymological discursions should therefore be considered in the same way 
as his phenomenological proposals regarding Dasein’s existential components: we 
should try them on, to consider whether, in the end, they allow us to see something 
we had not heretofore seen. As Polt points out, Heidegger’s etymologies, while 
idiosyncratic, nevertheless succeed in shedding a new light on the tradition: 
“Translating logos as ‘reason’ may not be wrong, but it certainly does less to make us 
think than does Heidegger’s rendition of it as ‘collecting collectedness’” (Heidegger: 
An Introduction 135).
