Forum Day Three: Session Three 219
ERHARD
You’re a human being. There’s always going to be something up for you. Your life is always
going to be a soap opera. And it’s always going to be a joke. And every once and a while you’ll
come back to me and get it again.
TONY
I just want to know one thing.
ERHARD
If we get this one thing it’s going to change everything, right? It’s not going to be the way it is,
it’ll be some other way if you get this. If you get this one thing answered, just this one thing.
TONY
Where does God fi t into all this?
ERHARD
Remember I said I didn’t discuss God with people who don’t know their ass from a hole in the
ground.
TONY
Yeah, believe me, there’s a hole in the ground right over there. This is really big for me.
ERHARD
What?
TONY
Having God in my life, and that God makes a diff erence in other people’s lives.
ERHARD
That’s fi ne. Yeah, but you want to make that diff erent than a fart.
TONY
Sure I do.
ERHARD
No, that’s disgusting. If you got God in your life, you’ve got God in your life. That’s all.
TONY
But if you have God in your life then you have purpose in your life.
ERHARD
Really? It’s not going to end with you being put in the ground and dirt being thrown in your
face?
While these passages are from Heidegger’s early work, and the
distinction appropriation became central in his later thinking, we
propose that the unspoken Same can be heard in both cases. This
intensely reflexive movement of thinking, called forth repeatedly
throughout the four days of The Forum and culminating in Session
Two of Day Four, is central to the achievement of its transformational
outcome. It is also deeply embedded in Heidegger’s distinction
appropriation, a term which suggests the taking-ownership of
something that is already at some level one’s own. ■

SPEAKING BEING
TONY
It will end that way.
ERHARD
It will. And you want to know what? You’ll be just like you are, whether or not you have God in
your life. I didn’t say there was something wrong with having God in your life. I didn’t say there
was something right with it. You want to turn this “God in my life” stuff  into another fucking
racket. You do. You don’t like that idea.
TONY
If you have the concept of God you have to believe that there’s a better place.
ERHARD
Who said that? The Pope?
TONY
Who the fuck is the Pope?
ERHARD
It’s just you talking. I didn’t say it wasn’t true. I just don’t want you to turn this into another
fucking racket. God is not going to save your ass. Your ass is going into a hole.
TONY
It’s already gone. Great. So if I have God in my life I have God in my life, if I don’t I don’t.
ERHARD
Exactly. That’s the fucking truth isn’t it?
TONY
That is the truth.
ERHARD
Right. You want to make some bullshit out of that.
TONY
Everybody does.
ERHARD
You want to make that mean something. I know everybody does, that’s why I got a job.
(applause)
TONY
Yeah, well, I want your job.
