Forum Day Three: Session Two 205
WES
That was the tip of the iceberg. Now we’re going to give you the opportunity to experience the
whole thing. It’s an exercise designed for you to really confront your fear of living and being
with people. You may hear people expressing it, crying. Allow yourself to be with your fear of
other people. If you really allow yourself to experience it, the depth of it may surprise you. You
have to be willing to take on what I’m asking you to consider and stand in it.
The next forty-fi ve minutes were devoted to the Danger Process. Participants were asked to remain
in their chairs with their eyes closed and to follow Wes’s instructions, as he directed them to
surround themselves, in their imaginations with an ever-widening circle of dangerous people. First,
he told them to imagine that they were afraid of the people sitting on either side of them. After a few
minutes, he said they should imagine—“create”—that they were afraid of the hundreds of people in
The Forum room. With each step, participants were urged to create the experience of fear, to “let the
experience up,” and with each step he allowed time for the fear to be generated.
As he continued, Wes expanded the fearful environment to include the entire population of San
Francisco, and then the 250 million people in the United States, and the world (circa 1989). As he
exhorted participants to create the experience of fear, people began to respond vocally with screams
and shouts. At fi rst these were isolated, but gradually the room became a cacophony of cries and
wails. Wes, already using a microphone, had to speak even more loudly to make himself heard over
the din, as he persisted in his instruction that people let the fear up, that they continue to create for
themselves this fear of other people.
This dramatic expression of fear continued at maximum pitch for some fi fteen minutes. As it began
to subside, a few laughs could be heard permeating the screams, and Wes spoke.
WES
There’s something on the other side of it, something to get. There’s a fundamental absurdity
about living. All those people you are afraid of? They are, in fact, afraid of you.
At this point he reversed the process and led participants back through the concentric circles, this
time pointing out that all of those people they’d been afraid of—the population of the world, the
country, of California, of San Francisco, the people in The Forum, the people sitting on either side of
them—were “just as afraid of you as you are of them. Making you the most dangerous person in the
world.”
WES (as the laughter diminished)
Going through this exercise is about allowing you to be with your fear, not to get rid of it. This
may enable you to be compassionate, now that you understand what people are going through,
including yourself. This won’t make the fear go away, but will allow you to be with it. It’ll still be
there, but it doesn’t have to stop you. Not overcoming it, not in spite of it, but allowing it to be.
If you didn’t get it, go out on a street away from the hotel, and when someone approaching you
is about 3 or 4 feet away, jump out and say boo!
But recall: Being-in-the-world, as the Being of Dasein, is not
something separate from Dasein itself. In anxiety, therefore, Dasein—
the “there” of Being-there, the clearing in-the-world for Being—comes
face-to-face with itself, and not conceptually, but directly. Thrownness
is disclosed as what it is—a situation with no significance, a world
that we inhabit because that’s where we showed up. It has us, and it
has no meaning. And that’s all there is to it.
Anxiety reveals the nothing. We “hover” in anx-
iety. More precisely, anxiety leaves us hanging
because it induces the slipping away of beings
as a whole. This implies that we ourselves—we
humans who are in being—in the midst of beings
slip away from ourselves... In the altogether un-
settling experience of this hovering where there
is nothing to hold onto, pure Da-sein is all that is
still there. . . . (“WM” in BW101, emphasis added)
“
The ‘world’ can off er nothing more, and nei-
ther can the Dasein-with of Others. Anxiety
thus takes away from Dasein the possibility of
understanding itself, as it falls, in terms of the
‘world’ and the way things have been publicly
interpreted. (BT 232)
“
And when Being-in-the-world is all there is, what gets revealed is that
In anxiety, the meanings of our everyday reality—the
interpretations of the they-self—fall away. “Anxiety reveals the
nothing” (“WM” in BW 101).

SPEAKING BEING
(laughter)
Participants who had not yet shared in The Forum were asked to share their experience of the
exercise.
PARTICIPANT
I was feeling my body all scared, and I felt like I didn’t want to be left alone. I like to pretend like
I’m okay when I’m alone.
WES
Do you see a new possibility for yourself?
PARTICIPANT
To let people know I’m afraid.
WES
Powerful people are afraid and have the power to communicate that when it would make a
diff erence. Thank you.
(applause)
PARTICIPANT
I’ve always pretended to not be afraid. I remembered a childhood experience. I didn’t want to
go to school. I was afraid to do anything. I really am afraid of my children. I always have to be
strong. I didn’t cry when my dad died. I completely suppressed it. I’m willing to be with my
being scared.
WES
Great. Thanks.
(applause)
PARTICIPANT
I haven’t shared yet because I’m afraid. I got that it’s so ludicrous to be afraid of all these
people who are so afraid of me. I’m in a diff erent world now. I can see the faces out there, and I
couldn’t before. That wasn’t possible before.
WES
Thanks.
(applause)
Anxiety throws Dasein back upon that which
it is anxious about—its authentic potentiali-
ty-for-Being-in-the-world. Anxiety individualiz-
es Dasein for its ownmost Being-in-the-world,
which as something that understands, projects
itself essentially upon possibilities. Therefore,
with that which it is anxious about, anxiety
discloses Dasein as Being-possible... Anxiety
makes manifest in Dasein its Being-towards its
ownmost potentiality-for-Being—that is, its
Being-free for the freedom of choosing itself
and taking hold of itself. Anxiety brings Dasein
face-to-face with its Being-free-for the authen-
ticity of its Being, and for this authenticity as a
possibility which it always is. (BT 232)
“
Anxiety as the abyss of nothing has morphed into anxiety as
a clearing for the freedom of possibility. This is the essential
movement of The Forum, hinted at persistently and in many
iterations throughout the conversation. This is the reflexive
rhetorical moment that will be achieved in its fullness by The
Forum’s conclusion, and for which the Danger Process has greased
the slide. In Heidegger’s terms, this is the event of appropriation.
In anxiety, we are confronted with the fundamental possibility
of our existence, because the people, things, and events which
usually have meaning for us are suddenly without significance.
Literally, they mean nothing: “When anxiety has subsided, then in
our everyday way of talking we are accustomed to say that ‘it was
really nothing.’ And what it was, indeed, does get reached ontically
by such a way of talking” (BT 231).
We call attention to Heidegger’s use here of the qualifier
“ontically,” which refers to facts and concepts within the realm
of beings. That is, it is conceptually accurate to say that what we
