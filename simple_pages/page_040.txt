SPEAKING BEING
from being an asshole, send me a fl yer, and I will decide if that’s the seminar that’ll handle my 
being an asshole.
BILL
You know I have to say something. The only value I’ve gotten so far is entertainment from your 
cynicism.
ERHARD
You remember when I said you would be sitting there with your judgments and assessments?
BILL
Believe me, I’m here with an open mind.
This interaction, which was in its early moments the most belligerent of the entire four days, grad-
ually became playful. Bill began to smile, and the dialogue assumed the character of good-natured
sparring.
ERHARD
Back to the issue of pressure. Did you get a lot of phone calls?
BILL
From one lady in particular. During the process I was trying to prospect her into something 
and in the end she prospected me into something.
(laughter)
ERHARD
I’m not going to ask what you were prospecting her into. But at any rate there was a lady who
called you a number of times.
BILL
She’s married, Werner.
ERHARD
It’s hard to have this conversation with you with your foot nailed to the fl oor. How many times
did she call?
BILL
I don’t know. A half dozen to a dozen times. Perhaps more.
ERHARD
And what did you say to her when she called to talk about The Forum?
ERHARD (continuing)
