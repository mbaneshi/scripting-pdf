Forum Day Four: Session Three 525
BERNICE (very moved)
This is the fi rst time I‚Äôve gotten up to share. I don‚Äôt know if I can make it without crying. I want
to acknowledge someone I haven‚Äôt acknowledged in about ten years of my life. And that‚Äôs my
brother. I love you. He introduced me to The Forum and I fought him every step of the way. One
of my rackets is that people are setting me up to fail, and I had thought: ‚ÄúIf you set me up here,
I will never forgive you!‚Äù
(laughter)
But you have given me more with this Forum, than I‚Äôve ever gotten from anyone in my life. And
I love you so much. I also want to acknowledge and thank Jane. Everything she said, I felt so
deeply, and there are no words to describe my gratitude. But, I just want to say, I think you are a
truly beautiful person, you have the courage to stand up and tell people, and I owe you for that.
Thank you.
KIPP (to applause)
Very well said!
VICTOR
I don‚Äôt know where they are in the room but my brother and my mother are here and I take my
hat off  to you, and I want to say that I love the both of you. You are my family, and are pretty
much the most important thing in my life. I thank you for giving me the chance to see who I
was, who the hell I really was. I love you. And I thank all the people that shared. I saw a little of
my self in each and every one of you. And now I know who that is and I have to accept and be
with that I‚Äôm a human being.
KIPP (to applause)
Well said! Thank you!
MIC
This is the fi rst time I‚Äôve gotten up to share, and I was pretty sure I‚Äôd get through the whole
Forum without having to. I want to thank the people who I‚Äôve had conversations with, each
one is an exceptional person. And I want to thank my girlfriend, who was the fi rst person to
introduce me to The Forum and basically put up with all my shit. I just want to say thank you,
and I love you, and I will tell you that in private, but right now I want everyone to hear that
also. I love you.
KIPP
Beautiful!
ROB
I didn‚Äôt expect you to call on me! I did est back in 1974, and it was great. A lot of things
happened in between, and everybody has said what I want to say. I just feel at a loss for words. I
want to express my gratitude for you Kipp. When you fi rst came out, I thought, ‚Äúwho is this?‚Äù

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP (to laughter)
That‚Äôs what I thought when I fi rst came out.
ROB
After the second session, I was ‚Äúthis guy‚Äôs incredible.‚Äù Even though I‚Äôve only talked to a few of
you here, I love you all. I love who you are and I love who I am. I am comfortable in my own
presence. Thank you!
KIPP
Thank you very much.
STEPHAN (wearing clerical attire)
I want to thank you Kipp, Wes, and Werner, of course, but you and Wes in a very special way,
because you were with me in a very special way. I‚Äôve been complete with my parents and my
sister, who are dead now. And the completion I got is a great joy. And now out of this I get to
pray to my parents. They are now with me, to empower me. That‚Äôs an immense gift. The other
gift I want to acknowledge for you out of the whole process of the empty and meaningless and
being down in the shadow of the Valley of Death, you know, that‚Äôs our territory...
(laughter)
I want you to know that I put on my meaning suit. This is a meaning suit, full of meaning.
What I want to thank you for is being able to live again my priesthood. And I declare that I am a
renewed priest, and available for the transformation of people everywhere, the people especially
who are in religion, and if I can be selfi sh, in my own church, but for all people. God bless you
and thank you for that.
KIPP (to applause)
Thank you very much!
(walking back up to the platform)
So, in the interest of sleep, we‚Äôll go on and what I‚Äôd like to get created a little bit for you is
our Forum Evening Sessions coming up next week. And The Forum Evening Sessions are
designed to complete The Forum, and there are two aspects of the completion of The Forum.
One of the aspects is contributing this. As many of you said since being here, it took a lot to
get you here, and it‚Äôs now an opportunity for you to contribute the possibility of The Forum in
everybody‚Äôs life in your life. That‚Äôs one aspect of The Forum Evening Session. And the other
aspect of The Forum Evening Session is designed to create the third part of The Forum. The
fi rst part is about unconcealing the being of human being. The second part is about creating the
possibility of being for human being, and the third part of The Forum is discovering your life as
a commitment to possibility. So The Forum Evening Session could be said to be about the rest of
your life. And it really is the completion of that.
