doesn’t screw it up by trying to fi x it. If all she does is just be with it, there will be a whole new
possibility in attraction. It’ll be a diff erent thing for her. That will not be the limit of attraction.
JODIE
I’ve buried me. I’ve buried it so much, I don’t even know what’s there anymore. I don’t want to
take it out and look at it.
ERHARD (to Jodie)
That’s really very beautiful, what you saw: really extraordinary. It took me about ten years to
get what you got overnight. What you begin to see here is that when the name of the game
is looking good, there is no self-expression. None. So whatever there is, whatever quality life
would have, if life were self-expression, it doesn’t have that when life is looking good. And life is
looking good.
(to the group)
You aren’t going to get any clearer than she gave it to you. I’m going to talk about it a lot. But
she gave it to you real clearly.
(to Jodie)
What else?
JODIE
It all comes down to wanting to be liked. And what shows up for me in relationships and espe-
cially work relationships, I put on this story: “I don’t care if I’m liked, I want to be respected.”
ERHARD
Anybody who tells you that is full of shit. What they really mean is that they’re not sure about
being liked. They don’t know whether they can play that game. They got more confi dence about
being respected. Everybody wants to be liked. It’s nothing personal about you. It’s a rainstorm
called the already always being of human beings. And it is in the nature of being of human be-
ings to have a powerful concern for being liked. And there are endless strategies for dealing with
this powerful addiction to looking good. People who say they don’t care about being liked: if you
don’t care then why are you telling me? You didn’t say you didn’t care if I blink my eyes. Why
did you go out of your way to say you don’t care if I like you? “Methinks the lady doth protest
too much.” It’s not personal. Can we get that fl at now? It’s not personal. You don’t have a fuck-
ing thing to do with it, nothing. You didn’t make that up. It belongs to the already always being
of human being. You just happened to walk into the rainstorm called being a human being, and
as such you got wet by that rain. You personally want to be liked, have to be liked, need to be
liked, are addicted to being liked. But it’s nothing personal, and treating it personally is stupid
and it will make you stupid. Some people are guilty about wanting to be liked. You’re guilty of
being a human being, that’s all. You need to know it’s an ontological phenomenon, a phenome-
non of being. And it doesn’t belong to you personally, it belongs to being human, as you do.

What you begin to see here is that when the
name of the game is looking good, there is no
self-expression. None. So whatever there is,
whatever quality life would have, if life were
self-expression, it doesn’t have that when life
is looking good. And life is looking good.

SPEAKING BEING
While Jodie remained standing, another participant, Max, who had the story about Vietnam, stood
to speak.
MAX (visibly shaking)
I’m stuck. I’m afraid I won’t get it. I want to pay my money and have you give it to me. I don’t
want to have to work at it. I’m really controlled by looking good. I know it controls my life.
I’m living my life for everybody else, not myself. I’m stuck and I don’t know what to do with
that right now. I’m pissed off  at myself when you asked if there was anybody who didn’t get
authenticity...
ERHARD
About being inauthentic.
MAX
I’m stuck on that. I don’t know where to go with it. I don’t understand it.
ERHARD
All right. I got it. You’re in the right place. Relax. I mean, I know you won’t relax, but you’re in
the right place. I just read your thermometer. You’re all right.
JODIE
I’m really concerned about people liking me, but it’s not me that I’m portraying for them to like
anyway. There’s this big catch 22. I really want you to like me, but it’s not the real me anyway so
if you don’t like me, I already have an out.
ERHARD
Right. It’s very illogical. Very nutty. What’s that thing about lies and webs? “Oh what a tangled
web we weave, when fi rst we practice to deceive.” You have no idea how tangled it is. It starts
with the fi rst lie, and the fi rst lie is: the story is true. Very powerful contribution. Thanks.
Jodie sat to applause. Wes then replaced Erhard on the platform and directed participants to engage
in a few minutes of “paired sharing—sharing with the person seated next to you what you have
been seeing in The Forum so far today.”  Following this, he gave the group an assignment for the
upcoming break.
WES
Have a conversation, like an inquiry, with at least one other person about your racket. I want
you to consider the possibility that you are a candy store with a racket in the back. Rackets have
t
a cost and a payoff . What are yours? Get some insight into your racket—what the payoff  is and
what it costs you. There’s a point to it that gets you something from other people and from life,
and what does that kind of way of being cost you? Get some insight into your racket. That’s the
opportunity of the break.
The fi rst break of the day began at 12:35 pm.

SPEAKING BEING
“Proximally” is a term Heidegger uses frequently in Being and Time to characterize
our most obvious and everyday experiences. These experiences, he says, do not
include a perception of Being, which remains hidden, even though it constitutes
the meaning and ground of what shows itself. Therefore, when defined by its sub-
ject-matter, “phenomenology is the science of the Being of entities—ontology”
(BT 61). For Heidegger’s phenomenology “the thing itself” (which of course is not a
T
thing at all) is Being.
A further complication for the phenomenological approach is that for Heide-
gger it must always be recognized as hermeneutical. Hermeneutics is the study of
interpretation, the process by which we develop an understanding of a phenome-
non. We can never get to “the things themselves,” says Heidegger, since perception
is always mediated by the understanding of the human being doing the perceiving,
and that understanding has always been arrived at by a process of interpretation.
Thus by defining his phenomenological method as hermeneutical, Heidegger is
including his recognition that whatever understanding he arrives at will never be the
“final” one: “For in such an inquiry, one is constantly compelled to face the possibil-
ity of disclosing an even more primordial and more universal horizon from which we
may draw the answer to the question, “What is Being?” (BT 49).
T
This lack of closure that characterizes a hermeneutical phenomenology is
important for both Heidegger and for the work of Werner Erhard. Heidegger’s stated
goal is to let Dasein “put itself into words for the very first time, so that it may decide
SESSION ONE INTERVAL
Hermeneutic Phenomenology
Heidegger’s analysis of Dasein in Being and Time is based in two philosophical orien-
tations: phenomenology and hermeneutics.
Heidegger’s introduction to phenomenology as a philosophical method came
by way of Heidegger’s mentor and colleague, Edmund Husserl, who summarized the
approach with his famous exhortation, “To the things themselves!” In Heidegger’s
characteristic reformulation of this approach, phenomenology means “to let that
which shows itself be seen from itself in the very way in which it shows itself from
itself” (BT 58). Both statements point to phenomenology’s fundamental purpose:
T
to set aside all previous theoretical and philosophical constructions (Husserl called
this “bracketing”), in order to bring the phenomena fully into the light.
Of course, Heidegger acknowledges, this purpose may be seen as “abundantly
self-evident,” since it states “the underlying principle of any scientific knowledge
whatsoever” (BT 50). And certainly phenomenology, as both a philosophical ori-
T
entation and a method of inquiry, is suff iciently flexible to have been subjected to
widely varying interpretations (see, e.g., www.phenomenologyonline.com). (Note:
Although at the time of this 1989 Forum Werner Erhard did not present his work
using the term “phenomenological,” his later projects, as well as the recent work of
Landmark Worldwide, have employed this term.)
But regardless of the term’s inexactness, Heidegger is adamant that a rigorous
phenomenological inquiry can penetrate the layers of appearance and semblance
which normally impede our access to things. Heidegger’s goal in the inquiry is
aletheia, or unconcealment, which for the early Greek philosophers was the truth of
“pure sensory perception,” prior to any judgment or covering-up. Phenomenology
perceives things “just by looking at them,” thereby (in a phrase employed by both
Heidegger and Werner Erhard) “letting beings be.”
Since Heidegger’s inquiry is concerned with the meaning of Being, his phenom-
enology has a specific character:
“
What is it that by its very essence is necessarily the theme
y
whenever we exhibit something explicitly? Manifestly, it
is something that proximally and for the most part does
not show itself at all: it is something that lies
t
hidden, in
contrast to that which proximally and for the most part
does show itself; but at the same time it is something
that belongs to what shows itself, and it belongs to it
so essentially as to constitute its meaning and its
ground. (BT 59)

Forum Day Two: Session One Interval 117
of its own accord whether, as the entity which it is, it has that state of Being which
is disclosed in this interpretation” (BT 362). But really, isn’t it more accurate to say
T
that the words into which Dasein is being put are Heidegger’s words (and likewise,
Erhard’s words)? Heidegger is creating his own hermeneutical vocabulary here. Why
should we accept these terms as valid?
Heidegger is not arguing that we should. He is not proposing a final truth, but
a step on the way, and he asks that we—as ourselves Dasein—decide “of our own
accord” whether we find value in his interpretation. This is always the way that
thinking advances—through the development and testing of new vocabularies. In
the field of psychology, Freud invented a vocabulary to describe the behaviors he
observed in his work. He did not “discover” the ego and the id, but invented them,
and for decades they demonstrated their validity through their use by generations of
psychotherapists. More recently, they have been largely supplanted by other vocab-
ularies, or by psychotropic drugs; and many of Freud’s terms have taken their place
in our everyday usage, where excessive neatness is routinely characterized as “anal”
behavior, and an inflated ego is considered as natural as a sore elbow.
Werner Erhard regularly frames his work as a new vocabulary to be consid-
ered. “We ask you not to believe anything that’s said in here,” he tells The Forum
participants at the outset of the four days. Instead, he says on numerous occasions,
“consider the possibility,” or “stand in that theory and look at life,” or “try it on.”
¥
In the passage below, taken from an audiotaped 1986 seminar, we present an
example of Erhard’s phenomenological approach that is quite diff erent from that
demonstrated in The Forum. This seminar is a working session, in which he is inter-
acting with Forum graduates to develop distinctions on the subject of leadership, a
subject that Erhard has continued to develop in subsequent years into what is now
called the Being a Leader and Exercising Leadership Eff ectively Course: An Onto-
logical/Phenomenological Approach. His method here is oft en framed in a sports
metaphor, in which the ideas to be “bracketed” are characterized as the comments
of observers (“up in the stands”), while “the things themselves” are the events as
they are experienced by those engaged in the game (“down on the court”).
ERHARD
What’s on the court when you’re on the court, rather than what’s on the court
when you’re up in the stands? What’s actually there like a presence? Peter?
PETER
Me watching somebody else.
ERHARD
Okay, very good. So if we stand back from the whole thing, there was you in
the stands watching somebody else. Now, you notice something down with
the people you were watching, which is the comment of an observer giving an
account. When you were giving that account, what was the guy and the gal on
the court . . . what was present?
PETER
(Silence)
ERHARD
Now let me give you a little clue about how to do this. One of the things that I
imagine was present was somebody. Is that true? There was actually somebody
there. . . . You don’t get leadership on an empty court. . . .  So this is kind of
obvious, but at least it’s a place to start: that leadership as a presence is people.
Okay. So what else is there, like a presence? People, we got that much. What
else, like a presence, is present?
PETER
There’s action.
ERHARD
Okay, but what action? Okay, let’s just stay with that. There’s action. So leader-
ship as a presence presences itself as action. People in action. . . .
PETER
So all I have is a description of it, an observation.
ERHARD
Good. Now I want you to get down there on the court and tell me what’s there.
So far what you’ve got down there is people in action.
PETER
So there’s . . . commitment.
