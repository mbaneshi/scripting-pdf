Forum Day Four: Session One

(to Kipp)
Did you ever get to reasonableness?
KIPP
No.
ERHARD
Were you planning on doing that today?
KIPP
Exactly.
ERHARD
Great. Raphaela?
RAPHAELA
When I was thinking of standing up, I was wanting to participate in-order-to. And life is
meaningless to me is really... I’m stuck. I want this coaching, I want to accept that, but if it’s
meaningless to me then what does that mean? I keep going in that circle.
ERHARD
Yeah, what does it mean that it’s meaningless and empty?
RAPHEAELA
Exactly. But for me to say that, I don’t... I’m still not accepting it. So, so what?
KIPP
You’ve made not accepting it mean something also. You know, like you should accept it.
RAPHAELA
Well, I follow what you’re saying...
KIPP
You mean you can see that accepting and not accepting are both meaningless. They both mean
the same thing. One means accepting and the other means not accepting.
RAPHAELA
Yeah. But at the same time I feel my racket coming up saying “I can’t accept that.”
ERHARD
What’s your racket?
world. “This is it” says Erhard. “You wanted to know how it was
going to turn out. Well this is it. This is how it turned out” (“Heart
of the Matter”). Inevitably, Being-in-the-world “enters into the
existential ‘mode’ of the ‘not-at-home’” (BT 233). This sense of not-
at-homeness is what is referred to as the uncanny.
Over the last several months, as the senior author has
become more open in his thinking, as well as in conversation,
to his own death as something impending, he has begun
to experience this uncanniness. And while letting go to this
confrontation has certainly included a quality of danger—the
discomfort of being on the edge, of jumping off the high diving
board, of being ungrounded—there has also been an experience
of great liberation regarding the tendency to flee given by the
“rainstorm” of the “they” self, which “does not permit us the
courage for anxiety in the face of death” (BT 298). Heidegger
T
continues:
As falling, everyday Being-towards-death is
a constant fleeing in the face of death. Being-
towards-the-end has the mode of evasion
in the face of it—giving new explanations
for it, understanding it inauthentically, and
concealing it. Factically one’s own Dasein is
always dying already; that is to say, it is in a
Being-towards-its-end. And it hides this Fact
from itself by recoining “death” as just a “case
of death” in Others—an everyday occurrence
which, if need be, gives us the assurance still
more plainly that ‘oneself’ is still ‘living.’
(BT 298

)
“
One might read in Heidegger’s words a degree of disparagement
toward the everyday way of Being-in-the-world endemic to the
“they” self. Perhaps Heidegger is attempting to lay bare everyday-
ness such that his readers might hear the call of conscience that
itself brings us to face a profound lack present in the tranquil life
dictated by the “they”:

SPEAKING BEING
RAPHAELA
My racket is that I won’t make a decision. So, to work that racket I make a decision for me and
I make a decision for everyone else and the decision I’m making is that I can’t accept that. And
I’m standing up here now because I have been participating “in-order-to,” so it’s not participat-
ing, it’s not sharing: Whatever I say, it’s coming out as in-order-to.
ERHARD
Like you can’t get out of that, can you? Everything you do is in-order-to; you can’t get out of
the trap. You try to get out of the trap, it gets you in the trap because trying to get out of the
trap... you’re doing what you’re doing to get out of the trap. And if you succumb to the trap,
you’re stuck in the trap. There’s no way out of the trap. It’s called being human. There’s no way
out of being human. The only thing you’ve got is to accept it; not accept like give in, but accept
like own, like be responsible for, like embrace. It’s called embracing yourself. You read it in
books: It’s called loving yourself or accepting yourself. Nobody knows what that means. People
think “loving yourself” is some zzzzzt thing. No. It’s what we’re talking about in here. We’ve
kind of got it fl ayed open so you can see it. It’s owning that you’re always in-order-to; that every
time you operate you’re operating out of your racket; and any attempt to operate with some-
thing other than your racket is another racket. It’s rackets all the way down... to the bottom.
At the bottom you get to empty and meaningless. That’s not a racket. Empty and meaningless
is worthless. It’s not good for anything. Empty and meaningless doesn’t make you right and it
doesn’t make anything wrong, and it doesn’t help you to dominate anything or avoid domination.
It doesn’t justify anything. And on top of that, all there is, is rackets and in-order-tos. And
that’s why it doesn’t make any diff erence whether you accept it or not. So you don’t accept that
it’s empty and meaningless? So what? It’s still empty and meaningless—except that it’s empty
and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless. Doesn’t make any diff erence. Still doesn’t
mean anything that it’s empty and meaningless. And if you did accept it, so what? Still empty
and meaningless. Doesn’t help when you accept it. Doesn’t go away. Doesn’t get fi xed. Still
empty and meaningless and it’s still empty and meaningless that it is empty and meaningless.
You see? Like that. What else?
RAPHAELA
Yesterday when we went through the fear experience...
ERHARD
That wasn’t fear, that was the danger exercise. You all will call it fear. That’s what you call it;
we call it the danger exercise.
(to Kipp)
Did you call it fear?
KIPP
Absolutely not.
The “they” gives its approval, and aggravates
the temptation to cover up from oneself one’s
ownmost Being-towards-death. This evasive
concealment in the face of death dominates
everydayness so stubbornly that, in Being with
one another, the ‘neighbors’ oft en still keep
talking the ‘dying person’ into the belief that
he will escape death and soon return to the
tranquillized everydayness of the world of his
concern. Such ‘solicitude’ is meant to ‘console’
him. [. . .] In this manner the “they” provides
a constant tranquillization about death. At
bottom, however, this is a tranquillization not
only for him who is ‘dying’ but just as much for
those who ‘console’ him. (BT 297–298

“
Following the familiar flight away from the nothing, and listening
away to the “they” self, we might easily conclude that people
don’t die. They pass. Yes, the euphemism is apt; certainly death is
a passage. At the same time, more openness and authenticity in
this realm is a worthy goal. Uncanny conversation is not morbid; it
only reveals that we are in an essential state of lack. We are to our
core striving to live practice lives designed to allow us to escape,
designed to relieve us of the anxiety that calls out from the
Nothing, reminding us that we are thrown to be what we already
and always are, human beings, meaning making machines, an
existence and facticity—the trap—from which there is no escape
other than to be in the trap. ■
