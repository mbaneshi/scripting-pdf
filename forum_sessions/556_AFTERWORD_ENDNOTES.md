A distinction is made sometimes between kensho and satori. Kensho is a first taste of
enlightenment, but one that must be continually cultivated and repeated. One transformation
experience is enough to get one started on the journey, but Buddhism argues that many
lifetimes are required to overcome the conditioning imposed by the three poisons, greed,
aversion and delusion.

In Heidegger and Theology (London and New York: 2014), Judith Wolfe shows that even
though Heidegger’s philosophy arose in constant critical dialogue with theology, Being and
Time analyzes finite human existence, without reference to God. Heidegger’s contention
that authentic existence involves Being-towards-death suggests an “eschatology without
eschaton.” In “The Facticity of Being God-Forsaken: The Young Heidegger and Luther’s
Theology of the Cross,” American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly, 79, 2 (2005), 273–290,
y
Sean J. McGrath argues that the task of phenomenology is to describe the Being of the fallen
human, and also to depict the extent to which finite, fallen existence can be authentic.
Theology’s eschatological concern with salvation and a possibly eternal aft erlife are not
matters of concern to philosophy, Heidegger concluded.

Humans are very good at recognizing patterns and making distinctions, but for patterns to
be experienced as meaningful, they must somehow matter to our Being-in-the-world. Our
r
existence is always at stake for us, which is what Heidegger meant by saying that the very
Being of humankind is care. Arguably, until computers exist in a clearing of their own, their
distinction-making—no matter how much faster than human distinction-making—will have
no significance for computers themselves. Computers are (not yet) at issue for themselves.
See Michael E. Zimmerman, “Heidegger on Techno-Posthumanism: Revolt against Finitude?
Or, Doing What Comes ‘Naturally’?” in Perfecting Human Futures: Technology, Secularization
and Eschatology, ed. J. Benjamin Hurlbut and Hava Tirosh-Samuelson (Dordrecht: Springer,
y
2015). In his books and many articles, Hubert Dreyfus has pioneered a Heideggerian critique of
Artificial Intelligence.

Something similar is true for certain interpretations of Christianity. When Jesus called his
followers “sons and daughters of God,” he aff irmed they were always already divine, although
y
cloaked in sin (analogous in some ways to rackets). As German philosopher G.W.F. Hegel put
it two centuries ago, in a controversial interpretation, Jesus was the first person to awaken to
his own divinity.
