Forum Day Four: Session Three 465
enough responsibility, and somebody’ll try to get close to me, and I’ll sit down. I’ll go on strike,
I’ll dare them to do whatever...
(breaking out into extended laughter)
A lot of people I’ve worked with—I’ve not allowed them to support me. I never realized that I
was just being my act about it. It never dawned on me that it was about being black and being
right. How it occurred for me is that they didn’t really care about me; that they were out for
their stuff . It wasn’t just who they are and who I am playing a game together. If I allowed in
what this work does for people; that would destroy my racket.
KIPP
And it would allow them to get the most out of you.
(laughter)
TRUMAN
Get the most out of me?
KIPP
Yeah. If this work gets the most out of people, it’ll get the most out of you.
TRUMAN (laughing)
Right, and I’m not interested in that.
(laughter)
I was sitting here. It was so funny. You were saying “Chocolate, choose.” And then it got funnier
when I was thinking “Chocolate chip, choose.”
(laughter)
KIPP
You all understand that all people are doing is sharing? All that’s happening is that people are
sharing. And you’re so excited; you’re peeing in your pants here. This is really more than you
ever bargained for in life. You never thought you could be a big enough person so that you could
hear people and let people this deeply into your lives. Thank you.
DARRELL
My whole act has been kind of being afraid of people, and then when I realized I got into the
conversation and saw that everybody is about as afraid of me as I am of them—that was a
bright light for me. I’ve been Mr. Aloof, sitting back like I know it all, and just wouldn’t talk to
anybody. I’ll just sit here looking like I’m in deep thought with myself and everyone will leave
me alone.

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
And you are in deep thought with yourself.
DARRELL
But what does it mean? It doesn’t mean anything.
KIPP
Right.
DARRELL
In these four days I’ve been talking about myself to people I don’t even know. It was useful. It
feels good. I feel that I don’t have to go around with this act. I don’t have to keep myself separate
because I’m afraid people will fi nd out who I really am. I’m happy with that. Thank you!
(applause)
KIPP
Well done. Thank you!
HARRIET
I’m feeling tremendous energy that it is to choose to take the microphone and to be willing to
engage in the conversation, and not know anything about being right, and what the in-order-to
is. Just feeling the energy of the danger and the danger of the energy be used by power and all
that. Now I feel stupid.
KIPP
Now you’re just here.
HARRIET
I’m just here. And I’ve been afraid to engage in conversation, wanting to be right in the
conversation, wanting to be reasonable, wanting to wait for just the right moment to share the
right thing.
KIPP
It’s a very big one, that business of waiting for the right moment, the right thing, the right way
to do it, that’s a killer.
HARRIET
It has a lot to do with signifi cance. I have to make everything extremely signifi cant and
extremely important.
KIPP
Everything has to be extremely signifi cant and extremely important?
