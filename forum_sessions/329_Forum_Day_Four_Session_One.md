Forum Day Four: Session One

MARGARET
That obvious, right?
KIPP
It’s that obvious for everybody, isn’t it, except you walk around like it’s not that obvious.
MARGARET
Well, for me it’s never lived like that. It’s always been that I’ve had to make sure it was fl awless,
to cover all the little seams up, so people wouldn’t fi nd out.
KIPP
Wouldn’t fi nd out?
MARGARET
That I was afraid that people wouldn’t love me, and the one I was hiding most from is me, or
that I love people. It sounds like such a stupid thing to say. That I walked around like I was a
machine. I’ve been like a machine.
KIPP
What do you mean by that?
MARGARET
Well, like... the easiest way I can say it is I had no right to be. I was always trying to get some-
where or do something.
KIPP
Yeah, but what I’m saying is that’s a little conceptual... I don’t hear you sharing yet.
MARGARET (after a long pause)
Okay. I called my mother. I was very upset with my mother, because I just got married a month
ago. She didn’t want to come to my wedding.
KIPP
No no. She didn’t want to come to the wedding or she didn’t come to the wedding.
MARGARET
She didn’t come to the wedding. But I had it that she didn’t want to come to my wedding and it
meant all these things.
KIPP
It meant?
How do I understand these things?
The view in which the equipmental contexture
stands at first, completely unobtrusive
and unthought, is the view and sight of
practical circumspection, of our practical
everyday orientation. “Unthought” means
that it is not thematically apprehended for
deliberate thinking about things; instead,
in circumspection we find our bearings in
regard to them. Circumspection uncovers and
understands things primarily as equipment.
[. . .] We say that an equipmental contexture
environs us. (BPP 163, emphasis added
P
)
“
I can of course assume a detached role in relation to the world,
taking on understanding as a science, or an intellectual task to be
accomplished. But this always happens against the background
of the world I already know from being in it. The background
understanding comes first.
World is not something subsequent that
we calculate as a result from the sum of all
beings. The world comes not aft erward but
beforehand, in the strict sense of the word.
[. . .] The world as already unveiled in advance
is such that we do not in fact specifically
occupy ourselves with it, or apprehend it, but
instead it is so self-evident, so much a matter
of course, that we are completely oblivious to
it. (BPP 165
P
)
“
It is, in a metaphor often employed by Werner Erhard, like water to
a fish: fundamental to existence, yet unavailable to our purview.
We see the beings within that purview—they occur as extant, which
for Heidegger means that they occur as substantial things in the
world.

SPEAKING BEING
MARGARET
She didn’t love me. “What’s wrong with me that she didn’t want to come to my wedding? How
could that be?” And you know it was funny because when she fi rst told me—that she wasn’t
coming to my wedding—it was fi ne. At fi rst I got it, and then I had it mean something.
KIPP
So what it means that your mother wasn’t coming to your wedding is...
MARGARET
She wasn’t coming to my wedding.
KIPP
“My mother’s not coming to my wedding.”
MARGARET
And then I had it mean something.
KIPP
You had it mean what?
MARGARET
First it meant that there was something wrong with me that she wasn’t coming to my wedding.
If I wasn’t the way I was, she would come to my wedding. There was something wrong with
me. And then I had it mean that she didn’t love me.
KIPP
Which means that there’s something wrong with her.
MARGARET
Right.
KIPP
Everybody know that’s the next step after there’s something wrong with you? There’s some-
thing wrong with them.
MARGARET
And then um, you know, I called her during the couple months before I got married and I
would talk to her, and I could see that when I started to have that she wasn’t coming to my
wedding means something, all I could do was talk to her as an in-order-to: in order to get her
to come to my wedding; in order to get her to love me. I even went from, “if she’s not going to
come to my wedding, the least she could do was tell me that she loves me.” And it was just... It’s
funny, because I just called her up, two days ago during a break, and I said to her, “I just called
But the world itself is of a different order of being. The
world itself occurs as Dasein does; and Da-Sein, remember,
is both Being-there and, for Heidegger Being-a-clearing. The
phenomenon is like nothing we are accustomed to thinking; thus
Heidegger’s presentation of the situation is provocative:
The world is not the sum total of extant
entities. It is, quite generally, not extant at all.
It is a determination of [B]eing-in-the-world, a
moment in the structure of the Dasein’s mode
of being. The world is something Dasein-ish, It
is not extant like things but it is da, there-here,
like the Dasein, the being-da [das Da-sein]
which we ourselves are: that is to say, it exists.
(BPP 166
P
)
“
The world, then, may be seen as a clearing where things can occur
meaningfully. This is also a working definition of human being:
the clearing in the world for meaning. Both definitions direct us
to a distinction, a distinction that hints at the unspoken realm of
world.
World-understanding as Dasein-understanding
is self-understanding. Self and world belong
together in the single entity, the Dasein. Self
and world are not two beings, like subject and
object, or like I and thou, but self and world
are the basic determination of the Dasein itself
in the unity of the structure of [B]eing-in-the-
world. (BPP 297
P
)

The transformational power of The Forum arises from its evocation
of that unity. ■
