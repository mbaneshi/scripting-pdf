Forum Day Four: Session Two

KIPP
Do you understand what she‚Äôs saying? She says your life is designed by your case, by your rack-
et. You get a life inside your case. And that‚Äôs your life. You don‚Äôt do things that are inconsistent
with your racket.
CLAUDIA
Right, and the other thing... The reason that I don‚Äôt want anybody to look at me is because, um,
can I say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid‚Äù? I‚Äôm afraid of being unattractive. And so I‚Äôm always unattractive from the
context of being attractive or unattractive...
KIPP
Is that how you say it to yourself, is that ‚Äúyou‚Äôre unattractive,‚Äù or what?
CLAUDIA
No. I don‚Äôt want anyone to look at me because they‚Äôre going to notice or judge and decide
whether they fi nd me attractive or not.
KIPP
Well, what do you think? Are you attractive?
CLAUDIA
Well, seeing that life is empty and meaningless...
(laughter)r
KIPP
Good. See all the service those people paid to let her speak like this?
CLAUDIA
So, I attract people when I attract people and I don‚Äôt when I don‚Äôt.
KIPP
Yeah.
(applause)
CLAUDIA
And the other thing that it has cost me from participating in, and what I‚Äôve been noticing here is...
WES
Notice how the signifi cance of all that has disappeared: this whole thing about attraction. Most
relationships... how signifi cant can a relationship really be when most relationships are like two
slot machines face-to-face waiting for a simultaneous jackpot?

SPEAKING BEING
(laughter)r
CLAUDIA
So the other way I didn‚Äôt participate, because I had being unattractive and attracting people
caught up with one aspect of being female, of being a woman I should say.
KIPP
Aren‚Äôt they the same thing?
CLAUDIA
Female is more scientifi c for me.
KIPP
That‚Äôs fi ne. You‚Äôve got to educate me. I‚Äôm stupid.
CLAUDIA
So it stopped me from enjoying certain aspects of being a woman.
KIPP
Yes, this is the important part.
CLAUDIA
And now it kind of unhooked a lot of those experiences from being an attractive woman. I
could just be a woman, be a person, enjoy those pleasures of...
KIPP
Well, you‚Äôre not going to use that conversation to not participate in your own life is what I hear.
CLAUDIA
Yeah.
KIPP
Well done, Claudia. Thank you very much.
(applause)
KIPP
See, where this is really going to be evident for you is in your conversations with other
people. If you notice, if this strikes true, then put it on: that a lot of your conversations with
other people are, that you get people to buy your reasons. What you call your friends, your
pals, are people that buy your reasons. So when you don‚Äôt do what you say you‚Äôre going to
