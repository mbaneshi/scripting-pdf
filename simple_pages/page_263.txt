Forum Day Three: Session Three 249
PATSY
Sometimes, but when you keep throwing those aces out to the same person for fi fteen years, 
for instance...
KIPP
Okay, roll ’em. Bring out the props. Okay...
PATSY
Angel’s my roommate!
The room broke out into prolonged laughter as Kipp made a sweeping motion as if operating a 
giant projector.
KIPP
Okay! Roll ’em and weep!
PATSY
I keep doing it and there comes a point where I want to make a choice that I don’t want that 
anymore.
WES
It’s not a choice, by the way. If we ever get this across—which is not looking good at this 
point—we’ll get to choice.
Wes imitated various possible internal dialogues participants might be having at this point in the 
proceedings, including, “Well, what about that multiple orgasm I had that time? Was that empty 
and meaningless?”
WES
That’s what you sound like... an internal dialogue machine. The way to blow the circuits on 
that is actually getting for yourself that this is empty and meaningless, and this is it. 
PATSY
It sounds real simple. 
WES
Too simple for complicated minds. You want to see what the complication of your life is, and 
the story, and the drama. And this concern you have for giving away your crummy aces. Like 
you don’t get it. It’s the giving of yourself away in which life occurs. All the rest is a drama. 
It’s all made up. It’s absurd. You’re absurd. But that’s okay, because they’re still going to throw 
dirt in your face whether you’re absurd or not. Do you think in a hundred years people will be 
discussing your relationships?
PATSY
No.
