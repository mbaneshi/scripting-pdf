SPEAKING BEING
BILL
I don’t really have anything to discuss that I am confused about, but it’s what has set me free
that makes me feel a lot better about my experience here. For one thing, I want to thank you
Werner for tolerating my controlling nature.
ERHARD
Yeah, and you and I needed to tolerate each other for it to work and so I want to thank you for
tolerating my controlling nature, too.
BILL (to laughter)
I came in this Forum with somewhat of a chip on my shoulder,
(laughter)
...and I was kind of angry. I had a lot of rackets that I couldn’t see until many of you stood up to
discuss them.
ERHARD (to the group)
This is called being big. This is called magnanimous. And it’s not that he is that. He gives
himself that in this action.
BILL
Anyway, I found that for myself I have a tendency to try to analyze behavior and try to explain
things on my terms in order for me to be in a controlling advantage. I don’t like to be controlled
at all. And at fi rst I felt like I was being controlled.
ERHARD
The word’s “dominated.”
BILL
Exactly. But what I was shown is that I can’t empower anybody. I lose love, lose self-expression,
and I lose freedom.
ERHARD
And you lose power. When you dominate you lose power. Love is power. Happiness is power.
Self-expression is power. Power is having your self realized in the world. That’s power.
BILL
Right. I fi nd that through letting that controlling element go and accepting myself for the way
I am, recognizing that I’m always already being that way, and yet being able to accept myself
more, and it was especially a release to fi nd out that things I was putting a contingency on: My
happiness is not contingent upon anything.
ERHARD
That’s right. We’re about to talk about your happiness. You’re in the right place. Keep going.
Forum Day Four: Session Three 517
BILL
For a great part of my life I’ve been doing things in-order-to. Very often in-order-to. I changed
jobs in-order-to; I got a college degree in-order-to. Everything I’ve done has been in-order-to.
I’ve been searching a lot to fi nd out how to be happy just being. And coming here is a... I want
to thank the people who compelled me to be here. Well, infl uenced me, empowered me...
ERHARD
People pressured you into being here. I understand. Go on.
(laughter)
BILL
They empowered me and they were very magnanimous in doing so. I recognize now that there’s
a lot of joy in just being.
ERHARD (to the group)
You want to hear that. You don’t want to listen to that like it’s some kind of platitude. Listen
to it like it’s a possibility into which to live your life. Joy in just being. That’s diff erent than
running your racket just being.
BILL
I came here with a lot of things on the line.
(holding back tears)
I had a brother who lived with me who was just killed in an automobile accident, and...
ERHARD
And that’s sad. Authentically so.
BILL
Yes.
ERHARD
Not racketedly so. Racketedly so it’s bullshit. Authentically it’s sad—to lose your brother.
BILL
But the way I was responding to it was I wanted to get out of my immediate environment and,
as I said, I’ve always been putting reasons and contingencies on every move in my life.
ERHARD
Hold on for a second. We’ve gotten a lot of people up here so you could see yourself. And a
lot of that was hard to see. Seeing some of the bullshit you are is hard to see. Now you got
a guy being the other end of the spectrum. A guy standing up being possibility. Start seeing
yourself there too. I don’t hear Bill giving a report. I hear Bill making a declaration. I hear
518
SPEAKING BEING
Bill standing for what he got out of his participation in The Forum. Bill’s making all this
up. There’s not one bit of it that’s not made up. Just like when the umpire says “strike”: It’s
a strike because he said so. It’s not a report on the man’s internal state. That’s not the way
I listen it. I listen him declaring himself, saying who he is in the matter of his participation
in The Forum.
BILL
I had called a friend that I had told I was moving to Germany. I had lived there previously and
was looking forward to it. My experience is not that I am going there because of anything: I get
now that I choose to go there.
ERHARD
Do you understand that’s just a way of speaking? But it’s not mere semantics as you would
call it. “I’m going there because I’ve chosen to go there.” It’s just a way of speaking. He could
say that he’s going there because he already made the commitment, or that it would be
inconvenient to get out of going there. Or I made the commitment when I wanted to get away
from being reminded that my brother died. Which one is empowering? Which one’s going to
give Bill the most power? The most freedom to be?
BILL
I’d like to in the future use this experience to make choices for myself and not blame them
on circumstances, and take complete responsibility for my life, and to experience the joy of
each day, every day of my life: to look forward to each day with a possibility; to not have my
happiness contingent upon anything I create or anything that I want in life. This is really giving
me the framework for, the context...
ERHARD
Because you said so. It is because he said so. When he stops saying so it won’t be. Brilliant, Bill.
Absolutely brilliant. Thank you for your generosity.
(applause)
(to the group)
The last step is the answer to the question, why can’t you say “I love you” to somebody? Because
you’re too sincere to do that. And you won’t say “I love you” to somebody unless you really feel
it, will you? I mean, that would be terrible, wouldn’t it? Saying “I love you” to people you didn’t
feel love for, that would be insincere, wouldn’t it? That’s true insincerity. Saying “I love you”
to people you don’t feel love for. That would be insincerity, right? That’s my proof for: You are
your feelings. You get that? I just proved to you that you are your feelings. See, what you say isn’t
insincere unless it’s an expression of your feelings. Which means you are that over which you’ve
got no dominion. That’s what you are... I’m accusing you of being your feelings. I’m accusing
you of being something over which you have nothing to say. I’m accusing you of being sincere,
which I fi nd disgusting, because that’s what sincere is, sincere is identifying with the way you
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day Four: Session Three 519
feel and the way you think, and the way you see things, about which you’ve got nothing to say.
Nothing. In fact the way you see things has to do with the way you were when you were a little
girl or a little boy. Anybody not clear about that? I say you can’t say “I love you” to somebody
without checking your feelings, because if you say “I love you” to somebody and you didn’t
feel like it, that would be insincere, inauthentic for you; because your love is an expression of
your feelings. Who you are is your feelings. Who you are is your internal state. Anybody not
clear about the accusation? Good. Now I want to talk to you about a possibility beyond that
accusation, which arises in getting clear about the accusation. Anybody want to tell me they’re
not clear about the accusation now that they know what the consequences are? Stand up.
RALPH
Can you repeat the accusation?
ERHARD
Sure. I said you can’t say “I love you” to a guy you don’t know—you can’t walk up to someone
you don’t know and say “I love you,” because it’s not true! It’s just a bunch of words. Unless
you feel love for somebody you can’t say “I love you” and have it be authentic. I say that that’s
incontrovertible, clear cut evidence that you are your feelings. That’s who you are. You are your
internal state: your feelings, and your thoughts, and your attitudes. That’s who you are.
RALPH
Because you can say “I love you” without authenticity...
ERHARD
Because you can’t say “I love you” without feeling it.
RALPH
And be authentic.
ERHARD
And be authentic. Precisely. But when you say “authentic,” you mean say yourself “honestly,”
right?
RALPH
Yes.
ERHARD
And if you say “I love you” to somebody and you don’t feel it, that’s not saying yourself
honestly. Therefore it must be true that you are your feelings.
RALPH
That’s where I miss it. It’s that connection I miss.
Transformation as Technology
In the face of this subjection to the technological way of Being,
what is there for us to do? Certainly, any action can never have as
its objective the “mastery” of technology. “That would mean, aft er
all, that man was the master of Being” (“TT” in QCT 38). Besides, as
Dreyfus observes, the more we try to master technolo gy, the more
520
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Look. I say “I love you.” But it’s just a bunch of words, because I don’t feel it.
RALPH
But when you say “I love you” and you feel it, I don’t understand why that means I am my
feelings.
ERHARD
Because you can’t say “I love you” without feeling it.
RALPH
So who you are is just the state of what is true for you, whatever that state is. Feelings or not
feelings. When they are there.
ERHARD
When they’re not there, then it’s not there.
RALPH
Then who you say you are is a lie. So who you are is your feelings, only when who you are, who
you are saying who you are is really the feeling.
ERHARD
No, you got it too complex. This has to do with thinking. Listen: “I assert that you are your
feelings.” And you should say “Okay, I heard your assertion; what evidence do you have to
validate that assertion?” Then I say, “My evidence is: When you say ‘I love you’ to somebody, it’s
not authentic for you unless you feel it—hence the evidence there validating my assertion that
you are your feelings. Because the ‘I’ which you’re speaking is your feelings or it’s not authentic.
‘I love you’: ‘I’ refers to my feelings.”
RALPH
I got it.
ERHARD
Thank you. I assert “you are your feelings.” And my evidence for that assertion is you can’t
say “I love you” to somebody and have it be authentic if you don’t feel it. What you mean by
“I” is feeling. “Feeling loves you. And I am my feelings, therefore I can say ‘I love you’ if I feel
it. Because ‘I’ and feeling are one. I am my feelings.” This is the age of sincerity. In an age of
sincerity people identify with their feelings—I don’t like “identify” because it’s a psychological
term and this is an ontological conversation. So I don’t say people identify with their feelings, I
say “you are your feelings,” and their mood, and their attitude, and their state of mind, and the
way they see things, and what they believe in—“believe” being something like feeling it, seeing
it. You don’t have a special “believe” organ. “Believe” is constituted of perceptions and thinking
and feeling. So I’m accusing you of being your internal state. You are your internal state because
this is the age of sincerity. In an age of sincerity, what you meant is what’s really important.
technological we become (“Gaining”). During his conversation with
Jacob in Session Three of Day Three, Erhard said, “The attempt to
get out of the trap constricts the bars of the prison. The attempt to
get beyond the ‘this-is-all-there-is’ keeps you in the trap. Trying to
get out of the prison keeps you in the prison. And not trying to get
out of the prison keeps you in the prison.”
Having sounded the alarm, Heidegger has a suggestion—not
an answer, but a hint, which also is echoed in Erhard’s technology
of transformation in the distinction “getting off  it,” where we are
no longer constrained to entertain a given way of Being (an already
and always way of listening). “In the normal course of events,”
said Erhard in Session Five of Day One, “if I found out my already
always listening was disempowering I would try to stop it. He [the
participant in dialogue with Erhard] didn’t change it. That’s the big
secret. Because when you change it, nothing changes.” Heidegger’s
suggestion comes from these lines from the German poet
Hölderlin: “But where danger is, grows/The saving power also”
(“QCT” in BW 333). That is, at its root, technology’s danger is at the
same time Being’s gift . Therefore, Heidegger asks, “might not an
adequate look into what enframing is, as a destining of revealing,
bring the upsurgence of the saving power into appearance?”
(“QCT” in BW 334). Here, he specifies the conditions for such an
upsurgence:
Because the essence of technology is nothing
technological, essential reflection upon tech-
nology and decisive confrontation with it must
happen in a realm that is, on the one hand, akin
to the essence of technology, and, on the other,
fundamentally diff erent from it. (“QCT” in
BW 340)
“
Being given by the technological way of Being, swept up into the
in-order-to, we cannot but be given entirely by “its” aims. We
don’t run it; it runs us. But appropriating this lostness there at the
precipice that Nothing brings us to face, at the very moment we
can be in the trap of the in-order-to, the saving power surges up.
That is Erhard’s technology of transformation.
Forum Day Four: Session Three 521
For example, if I really meant to do it, that’s just as good for you as if I did it. You can’t even
tell the diff erence. You don’t relate to people out of what they produce, you relate to people out
of their sincerity. No shit. So. There’s another possibility. And the other possibility is an Age
of Integrity. That’s diff erent than the age of sincerity. In the age of integrity you are your word.
Real simple. You just got clear that who you are is your feelings, your attitudes, your states of
mind, your internal state. In the age of integrity you are your word. That means you honor your
word as yourself. You’ve got to get that, because if you don’t you won’t get the rest of what I’m
going to say. You’ve got to get it abstractly. Not conceptually, but just the way I say it. You’ve got
to create the possibility of actually being your word. Not the idea of being your word. Not the
option of being my word. I am my word. I’ve got feelings, and I’ve got thoughts and attitudes
and a state of mind, and I have a hand. I am not my hand. I take care of my hand, I enjoy my
hand, I celebrate my hand, but I’m not my hand. And I have feelings. I take care of my feelings,
I enjoy my feelings, I celebrate my feelings, but I’m not my feelings, or my states of mind, or
my moods any more than I’m my hand. In an age of integrity you would be your word and you
would honor your word as your self: You wouldn’t honor your feelings as your self, you would
honor your word as your self. You would be your word and you would have feelings. Not be
your feelings. You be you word and have feelings like you have a hand. You would have feelings,
and have thoughts, and have an attitude, and have a state of mind, and you wouldn’t be that. So
instead of your life being shaped by your thoughts and feelings and attitudes, your life would
be shaped by your word. Because your word would be the context in which the world occurs,
and your feelings and your actions and your thoughts would be a correlate of an occurring that
arose in a world created by your word. So you would be able to love somebody just by saying so.
See, if I am my word and I say “I love you,” I love you. And it’s got power that your feelings will
never have. No diff erent than feeling “I love you.” See, if who you are is feeling, feeling “I love
you” is the same as if who you are is your word saying “I love you.” The same except that being
your feelings will never have the power that being your word has, because you’ve got something
to say about your word, and ain’t got shit to say about what you feel. When you start to honor
your word as yourself, live as your word, be your word, I don’t mean some silly moral horseshit
about keeping your word. You see this is only a possibility: You can’t struggle toward this; you
can’t set this up as a goal; you can’t try to achieve this; you can’t pray for this. You’ve got to
live in the possibility of this, because that’s the only way it will work. To live in the possibility,
to live from the possibility of being your word, and having your feelings, and your thoughts,
and your state of mind, and having your attitude, et cetera. It gives you power to love people,
rather than have love for them. It makes your word kind of sacred, and it gives you access to
the sacred. Being happy is a sacred state. See, if you are your word, you can say “I am happy”
and you are happy. And it ain’t a bunch of fucking words: It’s your self. It’s no diff erent than
reporting on your internal state. If what you are is your internal state, then to say “I’m happy,”
you’ve got to have an internal state called happy. But if you’re your word, you’re happy because
you say you’re happy: I am happy.” Your feelings and your attitudes and your state of mind and
your thoughts and your hand start to line up with your word. I don’t assess my feelings. I don’t
address my feelings to fi nd out who I am. I don’t look at my hand to fi nd out who I am either. I
also don’t look at my nose or my feet to fi nd out who I am. I don’t look at my feelings to fi nd out
who I am. And my hand lines up with who I am and so do my feelings, and so do my thoughts.
So I’m leaving you at this juncture of The Forum with the possibility of honoring your word as
ERHARD (continuing)
In an age of integrity you would be your word
and you would honor your word as your self:
You wouldn’t honor your feelings as your self,
you would honor your word as your self. You
would be your word and you would have feel-
ings. Not be your feelings. You be you word and
have feelings like you have a hand. You would
have feelings, and have thoughts, and have
an attitude, and have a state of mind, and you
wouldn’t be that. So instead of your life being
shaped by your thoughts and feelings and atti-
tudes, your life would be shaped by your word.

your self. Honoring your word as your self. Honoring your word as your self. Okay, speaking
about one’s word, and all the acknowledgments.
(pausing)
If I gave everyone in the room who’s awake an opportunity to speak, we would all thank each
other. The other people who participated in The Forum gave you an enormous gift, one of great
generosity and magnanimity. You did not pay for The Forum. You did not. The Forum you just
participated in was a gift from the people who assisted here—to you. Not to you as a personality
because they didn’t know you personally. It was a gift to the possibility that you are. This thing
wouldn’t exist without them. There were one hundred and twenty to one hundred and thirty
people who volunteered their time and their intelligence and their ability and their energy
and their humanity so that we could do this Forum together. They got here before you or I did,
and were here after you and I left. You wouldn’t have even gotten enrolled if it weren’t for the
assistants. And you know the kind of courage it took to enroll you. And the deep profound
humanity that it took to put up with your shit. So I wanted to give you an opportunity to
acknowledge the assistants.
(long, loud standing ovation)
Thirty-three staff  members of WE&A from diff erent centers put this together. If you get a
chance to be around staff  members, I recommend that you take that opportunity. Something
rubs off . You know, they are ordinary people like you and me. They’re not something
extraordinary. But what they’ve chosen to do with their lives... what gives you your life—listen
up—what gives you your life gives you: you. And what they’ve chosen to do with their lives
gives them something, and you ought to get some of that. And the way to get some of that is
be around them. One of the things you can do is nurture them and support them. That’d be all
right. The other thing you could do is assist with them. Hang out and watch them. I’d like to
give us an opportunity to acknowledge those thirty-three staff  members who created this Forum
for us.
(long applause)
Erhard at this point invited participants to go to church with him on New Years’ Eve.
ERHARD
I’m inviting you to go to church tomorrow night, New Year’s Eve. Some of you need to go to
church on New Year’s Eve.
(laughter)
It’s an Episcopal church, but there will be a rabbi (a she), a priest, a Zen monk, whatever you’re
up to you’ll be all right. You know, I spent a lot of time in church because my grandmother
got me up on Sunday morning and made me go to church every Sunday. After a while I kind
of liked it a little bit. I served on the alter and swung the incense. I wrote a little bit when I
went to school, and got an award for something I wrote, and the best thing I wrote was about
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day Four: Session Three 523
my experience in church. But let me tell you something: I’ve never had the kind of experience
with church like I’ve had at the service I’m inviting you to. It’s extraordinary. Whatever your
experience has been, I promise this is worth doing, and I’m not hustling you to go to church, or
I am, whatever you like. The last thing for me: Be at one of the seven evening sessions and get
all that shit out of your head about my reasons for asking you. The other thing is that there is
a lot of talk about me, and most of it is bullshit. I’m not worth all that talk, but there are some
things I am worth.
Here Erhard told a story about an “award” he had received from a professor of English at the
University of New Delhi—a Professor Manmohan—who had traveled with him in India. Normally,
Manmohan was very quiet. But when he’d talk with Erhard about Erhard’s work, he’d always ask
when Erhard was going to bring it to India.
ERHARD
Eventually we did do the work in India, and Manmohan had participated in the fi rst program
we did. One of the things he got, he got the possibility of an extraordinary relationship with
his father. Manmohan had a good relationship with his father, but particularly in the Indian
culture, it doesn’t matter how old you are, you are always your father’s son. Manmohan took the
train back to his father’s village and they sat and talked for hours, and they cried together, and
everything was wonderful, and opened up, and all that stuff . And Manmohan said, “Werner, my
father asked me ‘Son, what happened to you?’ And he told him about the work, and his father
said, ‘Oh, I understand, son: you found a guru.’” By the way, “you found a guru” is not an insult
in Indian culture. In this country it’s an insult. You’re in good shape if you found your guru in
India. Manmohan said to me, “You know Werner, I had to think about it, because I had just
fi nished being really straight with my father, and I really wanted to be straight with him and
answer his question. I told my father ‘No, father, I didn’t fi nd a guru. I found a friend.’” That’s
the most important award I’ve ever gotten. It’s the only one I want. And what I can promise you
is that I am your friend and I will always be here for you. I’ll always be for the possibility you
are, and if I never see you again, I’ll still be your friend for the rest of our time. So, if somebody
asks you: “You went to The Forum with Werner, who’s he?” You say “He’s a friend of mine” and
you’ll be telling them the truth. Thank you very much, and good night.
Erhard left the room through the opening in the curtains at the back of the platform, to a standing
ovation.
KIPP (walking up onto the platform)
Okay. On we go, into the wee hours of the morning! Does anybody want to go home?
(cheers of “no”)
Okay. Let’s welcome the visitors here in the room.
(applause)

SPEAKING BEING
Kipp then introduced himself to the visitors (those who have completed The Forum sometime in the
past and who had shared that experience with those taking the current Forum), as well as Wes, and
a long, standing ovation ensued.
KIPP
Thank you! I’d like to give some of you in The Forum an opportunity to say something to the
people who came in to complete The Forum with us tonight.
Kipp proceeded to select a participant to stand and share, and selected new participants who had
raised their hands as soon as one fi nished speaking.
SALLY (moved)
Thank you Roger, very very much, for sticking with me and being quite a person, a big person.
And your contributions to me, I value them, they are very important. This experience has
allowed me to get off  it. Quite a bit. And you know I’m on it. That’s a lot. That’s a lot. Now I
won’t have to spend so much time defending myself. I know there’s nothing to be afraid of.
Thanks!
KIPP (to applause)
Well done. Thank you!
CIARLA
Ken introduced me to The Forum about fi ve years ago, and at that time I didn’t take the
opportunity like I’m doing now. Thank you very much for having me participate in this work,
and I want you to know that I love you. I’m looking very much forward—we just got engaged
a couple months ago—and I’m very much looking forward to the rest of our lives together.
Thanks!
KIPP (to applause)
Thank you!
PAUL
There are three woman in my life who are here, and I am madly in love with each of them:
my mother, my future mother-in-law, and my fi ancée. These three women stand for me, no
matter what. They have a commitment to me being great, and I love them for it. I can say out
of this work, and I’ve been participating for a while, I know my relationship with Becky will
last forever out of just us saying so. Not out of how I feel, because I don’t feel like it a lot. It’s
really just out of our commitment, and our stand together, the possibility of this work and the
diff erence we can make, just like giving it away. And I just really want to say to you three that I
love you, and thanks!
KIPP (to applause)
Very nice!
Forum Day Four: Session Three 525
BERNICE (very moved)
This is the fi rst time I’ve gotten up to share. I don’t know if I can make it without crying. I want
to acknowledge someone I haven’t acknowledged in about ten years of my life. And that’s my
brother. I love you. He introduced me to The Forum and I fought him every step of the way. One
of my rackets is that people are setting me up to fail, and I had thought: “If you set me up here,
I will never forgive you!”
(laughter)
But you have given me more with this Forum, than I’ve ever gotten from anyone in my life. And
I love you so much. I also want to acknowledge and thank Jane. Everything she said, I felt so
deeply, and there are no words to describe my gratitude. But, I just want to say, I think you are a
truly beautiful person, you have the courage to stand up and tell people, and I owe you for that.
Thank you.
KIPP (to applause)
Very well said!
VICTOR
I don’t know where they are in the room but my brother and my mother are here and I take my
hat off  to you, and I want to say that I love the both of you. You are my family, and are pretty
much the most important thing in my life. I thank you for giving me the chance to see who I
was, who the hell I really was. I love you. And I thank all the people that shared. I saw a little of
my self in each and every one of you. And now I know who that is and I have to accept and be
with that I’m a human being.
KIPP (to applause)
Well said! Thank you!
MIC
This is the fi rst time I’ve gotten up to share, and I was pretty sure I’d get through the whole
Forum without having to. I want to thank the people who I’ve had conversations with, each
one is an exceptional person. And I want to thank my girlfriend, who was the fi rst person to
introduce me to The Forum and basically put up with all my shit. I just want to say thank you,
and I love you, and I will tell you that in private, but right now I want everyone to hear that
also. I love you.
KIPP
Beautiful!
ROB
I didn’t expect you to call on me! I did est back in 1974, and it was great. A lot of things
happened in between, and everybody has said what I want to say. I just feel at a loss for words. I
want to express my gratitude for you Kipp. When you fi rst came out, I thought, “who is this?”
526
SPEAKING BEING
KIPP (to laughter)
That’s what I thought when I fi rst came out.
ROB
After the second session, I was “this guy’s incredible.” Even though I’ve only talked to a few of
you here, I love you all. I love who you are and I love who I am. I am comfortable in my own
presence. Thank you!
KIPP
Thank you very much.
STEPHAN (wearing clerical attire)
I want to thank you Kipp, Wes, and Werner, of course, but you and Wes in a very special way,
because you were with me in a very special way. I’ve been complete with my parents and my
sister, who are dead now. And the completion I got is a great joy. And now out of this I get to
pray to my parents. They are now with me, to empower me. That’s an immense gift. The other
gift I want to acknowledge for you out of the whole process of the empty and meaningless and
being down in the shadow of the Valley of Death, you know, that’s our territory...
(laughter)
I want you to know that I put on my meaning suit. This is a meaning suit, full of meaning.
What I want to thank you for is being able to live again my priesthood. And I declare that I am a
renewed priest, and available for the transformation of people everywhere, the people especially
who are in religion, and if I can be selfi sh, in my own church, but for all people. God bless you
and thank you for that.
KIPP (to applause)
Thank you very much!
(walking back up to the platform)
So, in the interest of sleep, we’ll go on and what I’d like to get created a little bit for you is
our Forum Evening Sessions coming up next week. And The Forum Evening Sessions are
designed to complete The Forum, and there are two aspects of the completion of The Forum.
One of the aspects is contributing this. As many of you said since being here, it took a lot to
get you here, and it’s now an opportunity for you to contribute the possibility of The Forum in
everybody’s life in your life. That’s one aspect of The Forum Evening Session. And the other
aspect of The Forum Evening Session is designed to create the third part of The Forum. The
fi rst part is about unconcealing the being of human being. The second part is about creating the
possibility of being for human being, and the third part of The Forum is discovering your life as
a commitment to possibility. So The Forum Evening Session could be said to be about the rest of
your life. And it really is the completion of that.
Forum Day Four: Session Three 527
Kipp proceeded to review the logistics and procedure of the evening, including a play-by-play
recounting of what will happen, including having an opportunity to share during the evening
session, right at the beginning, when The Forum Leader presents the opportunity to share.
KIPP (continuing)
...and I invite you to not hold back, to create for yourself and the people that you have there,
having possibility in your life and in their lives... Now, I’m going to tell you everything you
need to know to share The Forum eff ectively and have your friends and family do The Forum.
It’s very simple and it’s very straightforward. So if you’re committed to sharing The Forum
and having people at your Forum Evening Session and having them register, the fi rst thing
is this: Do not sell The Forum. Simply be straight with the people in your lives. Say whatever
The Forum is for you. Whether you think it’s great or whether you’re not sure, whether you’re
confused, or if you think it was stupid, or whether you are totally enthusiastic with a thousand
breakthroughs. Whatever it truly is for you, authentically share that. Don’t sell The Forum.
Because what people listen to is not what you say. People listen to who you are being. The
second thing is, it serves the people who you are bringing for them to know there will be an
opportunity for them to register, so they should bring their schedules... and they should bring
money with them. Be straight with people. That’s what works. The last thing is this: When you
walk out of here and share The Forum, that is, share your self, you will be speaking into the
listening of the world. You already know what that listening is. When you share yourself, people
will think it’s a racket, it’s a cult... When you speak, people will have those thoughts. Everybody
clear? People will have those thoughts.
(Kipp grabs a tissue and holds it up; laughter)
Don’t get stuck with their thoughts. Don’t get stuck with your own. What there is to do is
simple. Okay?
Kipp grabbed the dictionary from a table on the platform, and he asked a participant to stand up on
the stage with him.
KIPP (addressing the participant)
When sharing The Forum with anyone, what’s the worst thing they could say to you?
ED
“I think you’re stupid and weird.”
KIPP
So this dictionary represents “I think you’re stupid and weird.” Resist it.
Kipp light-heartedly attacks Ed over and over with the dictionary repeating “I think you’re stupid
and weird” with each attack, and Ed defl ects each attack with upraised hands.
KIPP (to the group)
For the most part that’s what you call communication.
528
SPEAKING BEING
(laughter)
Here is what to do when people say that stuff  to you.
(to Ed)
This time take the dictionary.
(as Kipp attacks once more)
“I think you’re stupid and weird.”
(Ed takes the dictionary away)
That’s your job. So when people say that stuff , your job is to be with them. Chocolate: choose.
When you get a whole big pile of dictionaries, we turn around and put them down, and say,
what else you got? Peacocks are these gorgeous birds. Do you know what peacocks eat? They
eat poison off  the ground. If you want to make a diff erence in people’s lives, you’ve got to be
willing to eat their poison. Thank you Ed.
(Ed sits to applause)
And, you’re going to get stuck with some dictionaries. You’re going to notice in the middle of
a conversation with somebody, all of a sudden, you’ll be resisting what they are saying. You
notice that in the middle of a conversation, you can say, “I got hooked. Here’s what I want to
say.” I invite you not to stop. You can make a real contribution to the people in your lives this
weekend. Another thing: Whatever emergencies come up for you, whatever can normally stop
you in life, don’t get stopped. Be at your Forum Evening Session, and complete The Forum for
yourself.

in order to speak a language which communicates Being, one must speak from an
ontological location, a clearing, which provides access to Being.
The second question asks: how does the dialogic rhetorical structure of The
Forum achieve ontological transformation?
The Forum as an instance of ontological rhetoric—that is, rhetoric which
communicates strategically so as to produce a shift in its audience’s way of Being.
What are the central functional characteristics of ontological rhetoric, as they
have been developed in this book? Fundamental to ontological rhetoric is the
communication of an unsaid element of language. That is, both Heidegger and
d
Erhard hold that Being is a region or horizon which pervades and contextualizes
language, but which cannot itself be articulated. Nevertheless, while Being must
remain unspoken, it can nevertheless be brought to presence by means of a certain
kind of speaking; Heidegger proposed that a dialogue which is conducted in a
certain way can function to bring Being to presence for dialogic partners. Therefore,
The Forum is an attempt to design and enact a dialogue which brings Being to
presence as an unspoken element of a spoken conversation.
In order for Being to be brought to presence, an ontological shift must occur, a
t
transformation in the way human beings conceive themselves. According to Heidegger,
the presence of Being requires a clearing; in our current way of thinking and being,
however, the clearing which human beings are is obscured by the normative self-
structure which we call identity, or the “they” self and its current technological
way of Being. Therefore, much of The Forum is devoted to the deconstruction of
identity and its in-order-to, so that participants can begin to see themselves as a
different ontological entity: a clearing for Being from which it becomes possible to
appropriate one’s inauthenticity. Furthermore, from this event new possibilities
for Being arise, and as they are languaged, the world as it occurs transforms and
takes us along with it. This process of ontological deconstruction and invention is
posited in The Forum as a process that occurs entirely in language: The Forum is
a dialogic enactment of Heidegger’s thesis that “language is the house of Being.”
It creates the conditions for ontological transformation by engaging participants
in the speaking of a new language, a language grounded in certain ontological
assumptions (Erhard’s distinctions, the figures of speech and thought which
comprise his technology of transformation). During the four days of this 1989 Forum,
as participants engage in the dialogue and speak its language, they gradually come
to dwell in the ontological assumptions in which that language of distinctions is
grounded, ontological assumptions which have become available as an unsaid
element of the dialogue, and which produce the ontological shift which is The
Forum’s goal.
END OF DAY FOUR INTERVAL
CONCLUSION
Technology of Transformation
Two fundamental questions have guided our inquiry that has, at last, brought us
to bring to language Erhard’s technology of transformation as we have witnessed
it in the dialogue of The Forum and in our ruminations that have brought Heideg-
ger’s and Erhard’s thinking face-to-face: What are the foundations of Erhard’s rhetor-
ical and ontological rhetoric? How does the dialogic rhetorical structure of The Forum
achieve ontological transformation?
First, what are the foundations of Erhard’s rhetorical and ontological rhetoric?
We have sought to show that both Heidegger’s philosophy and Erhard’s
rhetoric are founded upon the existence and nature of what Heidegger calls the
ontological difference, the difference between beings and Being. Both projects
attempt to span this difference and to develop a language through which beings can
speak and communicate Being. The Forum may be seen as the practical, rhetorical
development of Heidegger’s thought in this area; Erhard appears to have taken
certain difficult Heideggerian ideas and made them accessible in a profound way.
It is not our thesis, however, that Heidegger’s thought is foundational
t
to Erhard’s work as a whole. According to Erhard, his project was generated
by an experience of ontological transformation which he underwent in 1971;
his subsequent work has been an evolving attempt to communicate that
transformation experience. His use of Heideggerian terms and concepts in this effort
began just a few years prior to the time The Forum replaced the est Training in 1985,
t
and indeed, it may be argued that this encounter was crucial in this development
of Erhard’s work, which development continues to this day in Landmark Worldwide
and in his new work with speaking the Being of leadership. In any event, while
drawing upon Heidegger’s ontological language to express his own transformation,
Erhard has simultaneously extended the communicative possibilities of that
Heideggerian language. That is, he has shown how a dialogue with Being might look
in lived experience and what its effect might be for those who participate in such an
unfolding ontological dialogue.
Thus the foundation of Erhard’s rhetoric may be seen to be its relationship with
Being, and that where ontological language speaks from determines its power: that
Forum Day Four: End of Day Four Interval 531
The strategic dialogue in which this process occurs is from time to time
characterized by aggressiveness and intrusiveness on Erhard’s part, and by frequent
resistance on the part of his dialogic partners. Heidegger has pointed out that
any attempt to analyze Being constantly has the character of doing violence to
the complacency of the everyday interpretation. Thus what occurs in The Forum
is the violation of the everyday interpretation, as identity (the “they” self) is
deconstructed and Being is wrested from unconcealment. In the process, Erhard’s
rhetoric sometimes seems intrusive, and the dialogue which it stimulates is often
combative; yet during the four days of The Forum the results of the dialogue are
dramatic.
Central to Erhard’s achievement is his rhetorical development of two
Heideggerian ideas. The first is the complex and elusive notion of appropriation,
which addresses the central paradox of the being-Being relationship: that human
beings can attain ontological freedom only by recognizing and allowing their
fundamental subservience to the play of Being. The second is the encounter with
the Nothing, the emptiness and meaningless correlative to the mood of anxiety.
Both of these ideas are communicated, in The Forum’s persistent and reiterative
ontological rhetoric, so that they can be apprehended as ontological insights:
that is, so that they produce a result in the participants’ way of Being by virtue of
discovering it for themselves, rather than simply being understood conceptually.
Through the reiterated dialogic communication of these ontological insights,
participants in The Forum’s dialogue come increasingly to dwell in the ontological
assumptions given by those insights, and then act in their lives with freedom to be
in the very circumstances that would otherwise appear as constraints.
Embedded in both of these Heideggerian ideas, and basic to The Forum’s
ontological rhetoric, is the figure of reflexivity. That is, for both Heidegger and
Erhard, what is necessary for the creation of a clearing for Being is that human
beings turn around and see themselves as they are. Thus The Forum is fundamentally
the enactment of a reflexive turn, a rhetorical figure par excellence: participants in
The Forum, by virtue of its technology of transformation, speak a language designed
to reveal them as they are, so that what may be simultaneously revealed, within and
beyond the way they are, is their own largest possibility.
We conclude that Erhard’s work is both a manifestation of the metaphysical/
technological tradition and a new appropriation of that tradition. Therefore, on the
Heideggerian view, it is an appropriate venue for a reflexive thinking which can step
back, and in taking such a step, to reach beyond the current technological paradigm
by reaching through that paradigm. The technology of The Forum is putting-into-
use putting itself to use in order to turn and see itself face-to-face. It is calculative,
technological thinking calculating its own deconstruction, reflexion radicalized
for the appropriation of its own essential nature. As a dialogic, rhetorical project,
it extends the communicative possibilities of Heidegger’s thinking, and makes the
event of appropriation, and the freeing release which it occasions, available to an
audience which Heidegger’s work is likely never to reach.

WERNER ERHARD,
MARTIN HEIDEGGER, A N D
THE POLITICS OF BEING
By Michael E. Zimmerman
Michael E. Zimmerman was a philosophy professor at Tulane University and the University of
Colorado at Boulder before retiring in 2015. Author of four books, and more than a hundred
articles and book chapters, Zimmerman’s research interests include environmental philosophy,
Heidegger, Nietzsche, Buddhism, and integral theory. His books include Eclipse of the Self (1981),
Heidegger’s Confrontation with Modernity (1990),
y
Contesting Earth’s Future (1994), and Integral
Ecology (2009).

Reading Bruce Hyde and Drew Kopp’s insightful book, Speaking Being, has been a
remarkable journey, one that brings me back to the transformation I experienced
when I took The est Training in December 1981. During the Training, I discovered a
t
profound and wholly unanticipated connection between the work of Werner Erhard
and that of Martin Heidegger. In spring 1982, I would find myself writing a philo-
sophical appraisal of the Training at Erhard’s request. This appraisal and related
conversations were two of many factors that eventuated in The Forum, which rolled
out in 1985.
Erhard developed the key elements of what would become The Forum (and
later, The Landmark Forum) long before he knew anything about Heidegger. The
point of Speaking Being is not to show that Erhard’s ideas derive from Heidegger’s,
but rather that there is a remarkable aff inity between ideas that the two thinkers
arrived at independently. The first question I will explore at length is this: Do the
remarkable parallels between the work of Erhard and Heidegger confirm the validity
of their respective findings?
Some autobiographical comments will help to contextualize my answer. Al-
though I eventually wrote two books and dozens of scholarly articles about Heide-
gger’s philosophy, my first encounter with it was an abject failure. In spring 1968,
as a senior philosophy major in college, I took a seminar on Being and Time (1927),
Heidegger’s most important work. I was feeling confident because the previous
semester I had apparently managed to make a little sense of Alfred North White-
head’s Process and Reality (1927), a notoriously diff icult text. The title of Heidegger’s
y
book attracted me, as did its cover, with large white letters standing against a black
background. The seminar was over my head, although I was hardly alone in my
confusion. Little secondary literature in English was available on Being and Time,
which had been translated only a few years earlier. Aft er struggling to about page
180, I realized that I had understood nothing about what was going on—especially
not how important “nothing” was to prove in Being and Time.
As a graduate student at Tulane University, I gave Being and Time another try,
this time in a seminar taught by Edward G. Ballard, who later became my disser-
tation director. In that seminar, I began to chip away at Heidegger’s conceptual
massif. Later, as a Fulbright-Hays Fellow in Belgium in 1972–73, I worked on my PhD
f
dissertation, “The Concept of the Self in Heidegger’s Being and Time.” Ballard was
enamored of Plato’s thinking because it combined philosophical depth with the pos-
sibility of transformation for the one who engages wholeheartedly with the Platonic
dialectic. Such a transformation, so Ballard maintained, is necessary to understand
what Plato was pointing at.
Aft erword
533
Gradually, I concluded that the same was true for making sense of Being and
Time.1 (And later I found undergoing a transformative experience was also required
to truly understand Erhard’s est Training program and later The Forum program.) To
t
understand the book meant doing more than writing intelligible sentences about its
oft en diff icult and controversial ideas. I needed to undergo the anxiety (Angst
(
) that
discloses human existence as neither a body nor even a mind, but instead as the
temporal clearing or openness in which things can manifest themselves and in that
sense can “be.” Surrendering to the mood of anxiety, however, is akin to a death
experience, from which we ordinarily flee. Heidegger’s concept of authentic human
existence, at least so I argued in Eclipse of the Self, amounts to the following.2 One
must own up to the fact that one has been thrown into the world as the mortal, tem-
poral openness required for entities to reveal themselves in various ways. Anxiety
invites us to suspend momentarily our absorption into the average, everyday way of
existing (for Erhard, this includes what he would call “running one’s racket”), so that
otherwise hidden possibilities—specific to our own capacities and situations—can
reveal themselves. Heidegger insisted, however, as does Erhard, that taking a stand
upon one’s own finite possibilities is not only unusual, but also diff icult to sustain.
We tend to fall back again and again into the tranquillizing mode of everyday life, in
which there is supposedly nothing really new or important to be discovered.
One day in the early 1970s, while a grad student at Tulane, I had a full-blown
anxiety moment that began as I was walking through the University Center. All
of a sudden, the people, furniture, floor and ceiling began pulling away from me.
Everyone and everything became utterly meaningless, insignificant, and pointless.
My projects, self-understanding, goals and objectives—these, too, fell away, leaving
only bare, unmotivated, directionless awareness. The world had become empty and
meaningless. Aft er a while, things started to regain their significance, such that I was
able to find my way around once again. This experience confirmed for me much of
what Heidegger had said about anxiety in Being and Time and elsewhere.
The occasion for another important insight occurred in early January 1978 on a
dark and stormy night. At the time, I was suff ering from the flu, which seemed like a
symptom of my unhappy personal situation. Feeling miserable while holed up in my
tiny apartment, I heard a knock at the door. A friend whom I rarely saw stood there,
shielding himself from the rain. Presenting me with a book, he said:  “Here, Michael.
I think you should read this.” With that, he departed, leaving me with a copy of Baba
Ram Dass’s book, Be Here Now.3 Formerly Richard Alpert, a psychology professor at
Harvard, Ram Dass (along with colleague Timothy Leary) had been dismissed from
the university for turning students onto LSD. Traveling to India, where he found his
guru, Ram Dass discovered that various meditative and yogic practices could gener-
ate the non-attachment and non-duality associated with enlightenment—without
using drugs. Be Here Now was so influential because Ram Dass brilliantly explained
major aspects of Indian teachings in ways that could resonate with Western readers.
Years earlier, I had seen Be Here Now at a bookstore, but I had dismissed it as
w
pop psychology masquerading as Eastern religion. I had little patience for either,
especially Asian thought to which my way was barred by a regrettable ethnocen-
trism. That this very book would appear unbidden in the midst of a personal crisis
persuaded me to read it that very night. In the wee hours I experienced something
like kensho, the Zen term for an initial awakening.4 I realized with unprecedented
conviction that my life was misguided, even though by the standards of most peo-
ple, including academics, my life was successful. Gripped by fear, I had long tried to
protect myself in ways that provoked unnecessary suff ering in myself and in others.
Attempting to satisfy various cravings, I had sometimes acted in ways that did not
make me feel proud. Suddenly, Søren Kierkegaard’s dictum, “The specific quality
of despair is not knowing that one is desperate,” struck me like a thunderbolt. That
night, I resolved to become a Zen monk, thereby supposing that doing so would
somehow bring me happiness.
First, of course, I needed to learn how to meditate.  Asian traditions oft en speak
of the tyranny of the “monkey mind,” the relentless interior chatter that jumps from
one topic to the next. My everyday experience was filled by neurotic chatter. All the
time I was thinking that it was I who was thinking, even though perhaps it would
be better to say that the thoughts were having me!  Aft er many years of meditation
practice, I finally learned how to silence the interior voice upon command. In the
summer of 1979, I spent five weeks as a guest student at Green Gulch Farm (near
Muir Woods outside of San Francisco) and at Tassajara Zen Mountain Retreat Center,
both of which were run by the San Francisco Zen Center. Arising at 4 am to meditate
every day (except Sundays, when we could sleep in until 6!) was challenging, in part
by the emotional torment provoked by being apart from my girlfriend, whom I even-
tually married. Clearly, I had a lot of work ahead of me.
In February 1980, I took part in a seven-day sesshin at the London Zen Center.
This was very serious business. Run by a well-known Rinzai Zen monk from Kyoto,
the sesshin required us to sit cross-legged for 40 minutes, sixteen times per day. Each
day was divided into four sessions of four 40-minute sittings. During the evening of
the third day, pain in my left  knee had become so overwhelming that I was exhaust-
ed. There was no way out, of course, because if you move your body in a Zen
y
sesshin,
you might as well go home. Having held the pain at arm’s length for as long as
534
SPEAKING BEING
possible, I finally surrendered to it. My expectation was that I would be obliterated,
leaving a smoking pile of rubble on the zafu (meditation cushion). Amazingly, how-
ever, the pain vanished, and was replaced by very intense sensations that had no
pain valence, so long as I did not introduce any temporal distinctions, such as “This
has lasted so long. . . ” or “How many more minutes. . . .” Upon introducing such dis-
tinctions, the excruciating pain would return, only to abate when I dove ever more
deeply into it, embracing and experiencing each subtle and not so subtle aspect of
it.  This was an astonishing discovery, which encouraged me to explore knee pain far
earlier during a later ten-day meditation retreat in Barre, Massachusetts. By letting
the sensations show up just as they occurred instant-by-instant, without telling a
story about them or representing them in some other way, they showed up as they
were rather than as how I had been representing them. By going ever more deeply
into the source of pain, I eventually experienced the disappearance of self and even
space/time, leaving nothing at all, which I later interpreted as what Heidegger called
the “clearing,” the no-thingness that allows all contents of awareness to reveal
themselves. Those contents can include the multiple stories we make up about
what shows up, but I discovered the diff erence between the sheer showing up
(Being) of contents, on the one hand, and my representations/stories about them,
on the other.
During the Zen sesshin, each of us had a nightly meeting with the Zen master,
a remarkable human being. I was typically a basket case when climbing the stairs
to his room, where he sat cross-legged. Usually, he just looked at me for a few
moments—without saying a word—before ringing the dismissal bell. I hoped that
the smile on his face was benevolent! Whatever shreds of self-assurance I may have
had before climbing the steps—“Aft er all, a man is justified in being tired aft er such
rigorous meditation!”—were removed by his penetrating gaze. I had a long way to
go before I could ever be like him. Nevertheless, his extraordinary mode of Being
showed me what is possible for a human being. I didn’t have to be this neurotic,
self-absorbed, worried person.
In December 1981, I took the est Training in a suburb of New Orleans. Given
t
the previous course of my life, which included writing about Heidegger’s concept
of authentic existence, practicing Zen meditation and hatha yoga, reading widely in
Eastern and Western spiritual traditions, and above all still wallowing in ignorance,
I was a prime candidate for what the Training had to off er. It allowed for the pos-
sibility of seeing that one’s “personality” is deeply tied up with one’s “racket,” the
particular way in which one defends one’s identity by making oneself right and/or
others wrong, or more generally, constantly justifying oneself. To experience being
free from my racket, I first had to become aware of its structure (that is, the “payoff s”
and the gratification that seems to come from the payoff s of my racket, and on the
other hand the “cost” of my rackets to the quality of my life), and second I had to
identify with it, to embrace it (make it my own). Paradoxically, this move was a nec-
essary condition for the next step, distinguishing myself from my racket. In doing so,
a palpable sense of freedom spontaneously arose. What had been my subjectivity,
my racket, now became a mere object in a wider awareness.
As the Training progressed, I began to conclude that this wider awareness is an
instance of what Heidegger had in mind by the “clearing,” the openness that consti-
tutes human existence. For Heidegger, authentic human existing means letting this
clearing disclose entities as they are, rather than as how they show up through one’s
projections, stories, and self-justifying assertions. At one point, in reply to the Train-
er’s query about what we were beginning to realize, I raised my hand to say: “Who
we really are is no-thing! We are not things, not identities, not personalities, not
emotions—we are the clearing in which all these can arise.” Even the distinction that
we are no-thing, so I came to realize, arises within the clearing. As Heidegger would
put it, we don’t own the clearing; instead, the clearing “owns” us so that things can
show up and thus “be.” I would later discover that while I was in that 1981 est Train-
ing, Werner Erhard was exploring some of the ways in which Heidegger’s thought
overlapped with and could grant greater force to the ideas embodied in the Training.
Not long ago, when I was conversing with Erhard, he referred to this famous
phrase from Heidegger’s essay “What Is Metaphysics?” (1929): We are “held out
into the nothing.”5 Erhard maintains that The Forum is designed to allow for this
experience, to be held out into the nothing, that is, into the emptiness and mean-
inglessness of existence. Without first-person experience of this emptiness, people
continue to cling to the subjective narratives that give rise to their rackets, as well as
other automatic instances of inauthenticity. Having become aware of their rackets
and their narrative-based identities, participants can notice the clearing—under-
stood not only as the open space needed for things to show up and thus “to be,” but
also as the opening for a possible future in which things might be other than what
r
would otherwise be predictable; indeed, a possible future in which people at times
might make choices not dictated by their rackets. The
t
experience of being held out
into the nothing, into meaninglessness, is necessary for disclosing the ontological
event called the clearing.
In our conversation, Erhard aff irmed that his profound encounter with the empti-
ness and meaninglessness of his own identity did not lead—contrary to expectation—
to moral irresponsibility and nihilism. In fact, prior to that encounter, he had acted
Aft erword
535
irresponsibly in ways that occasioned considerable suff ering on the part of others,
including members of his own family. He reported that by wiping away the signifi-
cance of his story, he was left  only with the ontological clearing. At this moment, what
l
showed up was the mess that he had created, but without any story about it, as well
as the authentic obligation to clean things up. Erhard told me that in cleaning things
up with his family, he told them he was not apologizing to them, because that would
somehow soft en the raw fact of what he had done. So long as he was his story, his
self-justifying interior narrative, the suff ering he had provoked remained blunted. He
could not let others be who they were; instead, they were reduced to pawns in his own
game. Unthinking identification with his story stood in the way of allowing others to
be beyond the limits imposed by their own narratives. This recognition contributed to
his decision to initiate the est Training.
t
What it means to share in the est Training
and The Forum
Most of the activity in the Training involved sharing by participants. Trainers (later,
Forum leaders) were there to help participants recognize their rackets, their ways
of manipulating self and others for ends that are oft en not understood. As Hyde
and Kopp have demonstrated so well in their book, the inter-subjective component
was crucial to the success of The Forum, as it was for the est Training. The centrality
t
of sharing in the Training helps to explain why it could take people so far so fast,
when compared to other avenues to transformation. Over the course of many hours,
participants listen to each other describe a similar mode of Being-in-the-world:
operating so as to promote survival oft en at the expense of others and their own
quality of life. It is easier to recognize these inauthentic ways of being in others, but
having done so leaves me with the possibility of seeing them in myself. The Training
and later The Forum (and The Landmark Forum) allowed over two million people
to reliably experience liberation from their rackets, from the compulsion to be right
(oft en at the expense of others) and from the need to constantly self-justify.
In the Training that I took—and as in the 1989 Forum recounted in this book—
the dialogue opened up, and soon revealed that the participants were frustrated,
suff ering, confused, and hiding their pettiness, all because of what the Forum leader
called their “rackets.” At first most people scoff ed at the idea that they were running
y
(or were run by) a racket. Instead, they were amazed at the ridiculous things that
other apparently accomplished people were saying about conducting their lives.
Gradually, however, the courage exhibited by certain participants in their honest
sharing shift ed the mood in the room to one of utmost seriousness regarding what
was being disclosed. Increasingly, we began to support one another in the sharing
process. We came to recognize that, perhaps for the first time, we were speaking
frankly with others about what really matters in life, and about the obstacles that we
had placed in the path of living aligned with what really matters.
I recall one particular moment when I experienced this for myself. It was on
the Saturday aft ernoon of the second weekend of the Training that I took in 1981,
when participants were asked to take part in a “milling” exercise (which is not found
in The Forum or The Landmark Forum). The ballroom had been cleared of chairs.
In the large open space, we were asked to walk slowly around, making eye contact
with others, but not engaging in conversation. We were simply to witness each oth-
er. By this point, many of us had already shared our stories. Otherwise successful,
educated, and capable people had started to “come clean” about their rackets. We
were in touch with the vast pain, heartache, sorrow, and frustration brought about
by our treachery, lying, cowardice, and perhaps above all self-deception. Even as I
write about this, I am brought back into that extraordinary moment, when waves
of compassion began arising within me. I had never experienced anything like it.
Finally understanding the mechanical, unavoidable aspect of so much human be-
havior, I also began to forgive others, and myself. We are thrown into a very diff icult
situation, we self-conscious human beings. Doing our best to survive and prosper,
we sometimes act in ways that later haunt us.
The courageous sharing that occurred in the Training allowed me and others
to see the truth of the Hindu saying, Tat tvam asi, “That thou art.” The poor devil
breaking down across the room, the other person who had made such a mess of her
life even while being so “successful”—now I could see that person is me, just running
a diff erent racket! One by one, people began to realize that we are all in this togeth-
er. Run by fear, we employ survival strategies, oft en developed before we became
self-conscious. By the time we are adults, we are deeply patterned to act in ways that
protect us and that justify us, such that everything we do is “in order to” promote
our self-defending project, whereas we experience little if anything in and for itself.
People want to act nobly, generously, courageously, and honestly, but doing so is dif-
t
ficult and rare, which is why we admire people on those occasions when they can act
in such ways. Seeing how compulsive the actions of other people are, participants
gain insight into how circumscribed their own lives are as a result of fear and anxiety,
and see that furthermore, no amount of achievement, success, sex, drugs, and rock
and roll will “fix me.” It is sometimes said that people are above all committed to
“Being right and looking good,” but in the Training invidious distinctions between
536
SPEAKING BEING
self and other melted away, without any sense of boundary violation. There arose a
higher level of “we-ness” that respected diff erence, but that no longer allowed diff er-
ence to create an insuperable barrier to being together in the world.
The Forum hammers home the idea that there is no way to escape the racket
that constitutes one’s basic way of Being-in-the-world, and that people do what
they do because they have little freedom in the matter. However, perhaps the great-
est realization generated in The Forum, as in the Training, is that despite all this,
people are more than their rackets, more than their fear-driven habitual stances and
practices. Rather, we are the clearing for possibility, as Erhard suggests in the tran-
script of the 1989 Forum. What makes the clearing for possibility available is what
Erhard calls “being authentic about one’s inauthenticity,” where we own up to—take
responsibility for—the fact that we compulsively “run rackets.” Such resolute em-
brace of my own inauthenticity unexpectedly allows for a taste of freedom, in which
a new possibility for action can show up. Such action is motivated not “in order to”
improve my standing, but instead arises solely for the sake of handling what a given
situation calls for, as an end in itself.
During the 1970s and 1980s, some critics charged the Training with promot-
ing narcissism, as in the “Me Generation,” and encouraging successful selfishness.
Although the actions of some Training graduates may have encouraged such critical
evaluations, the Training itself revealed step by step that self-absorption—especially
clinging to my “views” about this or that—is the source of suff ering in my life and in
the lives of others. Insight into our shared openness, the marvelous freedom with
d
which we are mysteriously endowed, generates not selfishness but rather compas-
sion and the question: “How can I help?” One of Erhard’s favorite phrases goes like
this: “If you forget who you really are, then be of service.” Erhard’s oft en-stated goal
of creating a world that works for everyone stems from a deep realization that life
is not just about me, it’s about everyone. Like many of those who took the Training
and later The Forum, I would not trade the insight it provided for anything in the
world. No amount of money, fame, power, sex, drugs, or knowledge is comparable
to what one spiritual tradition calls the “the pearl of great price.”
Spirituality and its relationship to the
est Training and The Forum
Those who are interested in spirituality and philosophy of religion, as I am,
can find parallels between Zen Buddhism, Hinduism, and Christianity, on the
one hand, and the Training, on the other. The Training and The Forum are best
understood, however, as ontological rather than “spiritual” explorations. Unlike
traditional spirituality, as typically experienced in church, synagogue, or mosque,
and in other non-religious spiritual disciplines, the Training sought to disclose the
ontological structure of human existence.
Erhard would agree that theologians can draw upon this ontological insight, as
twentieth-century German theologian Rudolf Bultmann drew upon Heidegger’s phi-
losophy so as to “demythologize” Christian theology. Theology, however, interprets
the transformational experience in accordance with religious concepts and narra-
tives, some of which conflict with the Training’s claim that everything is inherently
“empty and meaningless,” until we assign a meaning to something that occurs.6 For
Biblical theism, the universe was meaningful long before humans showed up, be-
cause God intentionally created it. Although informed by an evidence-based idea of
human existence, the Trainers engaged in phenomenology, that is, instead of getting
bogged down in discussion of the merits of this theory versus another one, Trainers
focused on what actually discloses itself in the processes of sharing and interpret-
ing that sharing. As the transcript of the 1989 Forum reveals, the number of shares
supporting The Forum’s basic assumptions—that we are the clearing in which things
can show up and thus “be,” and that we assign meanings to events that do not
inherently contain such meaning—was overwhelming.7
In the 1989 Forum, Erhard engages briefly in God-talk, but primarily to dissuade
people from using the idea of God to further their rackets. Doing so, he says at one
point, amounts to blasphemy. “Blasphemy” may seem to be a curious term to use in
a secular, ontological inquiry. Here is one way to make sense of that usage. The God-
talk in the 1989 Forum is an instance of what Buddhists calls skillful means (upaya).
Mahayana Buddhism, especially Zen, maintains that “salvation” does not lie in some
far-off  realm still to come, but instead is always already available here and now, in
this very human body/mind. Depicting God as some sort of super entity controlling
everything from up in heaven, while apart from human existence, impedes discovery
of humankind’s own mode of Being and the possibilities belonging to it. This is the
point made by the shocking Mahayana Buddhist directive: “If you encounter the Bud-
dha on the road, kill him!” You can’t kill the Buddha, however, because he’s not “out
there.” Instead, Buddha-nature lies within each human being, awaiting the possibility
of awakening to itself.8 Toward the end of The Forum, there typically arises what I
call “the space of transformation,” that extraordinary moment when most partici-
pants had the experience of shedding the burden of their rackets. Yes, the rackets will
return, but for many people, never with the force that the rackets once had.
Critics sometimes charge that Erhard’s seminars lack “spirituality,” but most
participants in the 1989 Forum experienced with joy the realization that they are not
Aft erword 537
substances with certain properties, but instead the clearing that is open to possibil-
ity. What The Forum refuses to provide, and in fact cannot provide based on its own
method of exploration, is some story about the ultimate “meaning of life.” The three
y
Western monotheisms provide such stories, which have inspired faith for many cen-
turies. Instead of off ering such a story, however, The Forum leaves to participants
the task of establishing goals and organizing their lives to achieve them. The issue of
an otherworldly, metaphysical eschaton does not come up, except when it is brought
up by participants, and then The Forum leader typically brings the conversation
back to the here and now, to what’s right in front of the participant. And yet, accord-
ing to Erhard, most clergy, be they priest, nun, rabbi, minister, or imam, have left  the
est Training or The Forum with a deeper relation to their particular practice of faith.
t
Deflecting and dismissing “metaphysical” concerns is a common practice
among Zen masters. Having been knocked off  a bridge into the water below by a
Zen master exasperated by his student’s persistent metaphysical questioning, for
example, one Zen student finally “awakened.” The key was finally realizing the futil-
ity of such questioning and the opportunity of existing fully in this life, moment by
moment. Another anecdote reveals the inveterate tendency to “go metaphysical,”
as well as the opportunity to follow a diff erent path. A famous Zen koan says: “Show
me your original face before you were born!” I used to think that the answer to this
koan had something to do with revealing who I was in the bardo, the realm in which
one’s “habit-energy” dwells before manifesting itself in a new body-mind.  This is
“going metaphysical” in a way suggested by some Buddhist discourse. Only recently
did I arrive at a very diff erent interpretation of the koan, one consistent with what I
learned in the Training and later in The Forum. The key is what word to stress in the
koan: “Show me your original face before YOU were born!” By “you,” the koan has
in mind the fear-driven, greedy, delusional being that I had turned myself into. I did
not show up in the world like that, but gave birth to that unhappy self by decisions I
made while growing up. Not long ago, when I asked Werner Erhard if he agreed with
this interpretation of the koan, he said “Yes! That’s it!”
Erhard, Heidegger, and The Forum
Around the time I took the Training, I had been reading psychiatrist Irvin D. Yalom’s
Existential Therapy, which argued that much human suff ering arose from not allow-
ing anxiety and ontological guilt to play the revelatory and transformative role they
could play in human existence.9 Citing authors such as Ernst Becker, author of The
Denial of Death, Yalom remarked that we shrink from life, we hide ourselves away, in
order to avoid paying the debt: death.10 Finitude is essential to authentic existence.
Staying in touch with mortality encourages us to be present each moment, rather
than fleeing into the myriad distractions now available.
I wrote to Yalom to see if I could study with him during a six-month sabbatical,
which I planned to spend in the Bay Area in the first half of 1982. He suggested that I
would benefit more by studying and teaching at the California School of Profession-
al Psychology in Berkeley. (The work I did there led to my subsequent appointment
as a clinical professor in the Psychiatry Department at Tulane University School of
Medicine.) Shortly aft er arriving in Berkeley in early January, Hubert Dreyfus invited
me to his house for dinner. Dreyfus was a leading interpreter of Heidegger’s philos-
ophy and later was professor emeritus for many years at the University of California
at Berkeley. Soon, I discovered that he, too, had done the Training, that he had been
blown away by it, that he knew Werner Erhard, and that he was co-director of the
PhD dissertation of Fernando Flores, who combined elements of speech act theory,
which he learned from Berkeley philosopher John Searle, with Heidegger’s view of
temporal-historical human existence, to develop a powerful vision of “conversation
for action” in the “off ice of the future.” Erhard, a brilliant man in his own right, quick-
ly came to appreciate the role played by language in creating futures where none
seemed possible. This is a story for another time, however.11
Even before meeting Flores and learning something about Heidegger’s thought,
Erhard and colleagues had been planning to redesign the Training. Erhard invited
Dreyfus and me to develop philosophical critiques of the Training. We gladly con-
sented to do so, because both of us had gained so much from it. Each of us sat in on
Trainings given at diff erent times and locations, then composed our assessments
of what we witnessed.12 In May 1982 I met with Erhard, Flores, and several of their
colleagues to discuss my findings. The papers that Dreyfus and I wrote contributed
to what would become The Forum, the first version of which was presented in San
Francisco in 1985. It was a pleasure to attend that signal event. I am proud and hap-
py to have made a contribution to the emergence of The Forum.
Not long ago, I re-read the 104-page transcript of the discussion about my
critique of the Training. Doing so confirmed for me that Erhard had already come
up with the key elements of the Training, later The Forum, independently of what
y
he learned about Heidegger from Flores, Dreyfus, me, and others. Heidegger’s ideas
were remarkably similar to Erhard’s in many ways, and Erhard learned some valu-
able distinctions from Heidegger, but they arrived at their major ideas on their own.
Heidegger’s writings have had an enormous influence on twentieth-century
philosophy in Europe, Latin America, and to a lesser extent in the United States.
Perhaps his university teaching helped to evoke transformation experiences on the
538
SPEAKING BEING
part of some students, but he created no seminars with that aim in mind. Erhard’s
work, in contrast, has been made available to more than two million people by way
of the Training and later The Forum. Linguistic distinctions developed by Erhard and
colleagues have had a vast if underappreciated influence on culture in the past forty
years. Many distinctions that Erhard coined or used in new contexts have found their
way into the larger culture without being attributed to Erhard. The present book is in
part an eff ort to correct this situation.
Another diff erence between Erhard and Heidegger concerns compassion and
forgiveness. Those familiar with Heidegger know that such ideas rarely appear in his
early writings. In fact, his writings in the 1930s oft en emphasize steely resolution,
authentic being-towards-death, and a kind of ruthless commitment to revolutionary
change. Such discourse became particularly frequent and charged in the years when
Heidegger was involved with National Socialism, beginning in 1932. Later on, Heide-
gger developed his famous discourse on Gelassenheit, or “releasement,” the attitude
of letting things be, which some have read as including compassion for others.
Let me now answer the question that I posed at the beginning of this first
section of this Aft erword, namely, “Do the remarkable parallels between the work
of Erhard and Heidegger confirm the validity of their respective findings?” The fact
that Heidegger and Erhard arrived independently at similar findings about human
existence justifies taking the two views more seriously than either one alone. The
remarkable confluence of their findings does not, of course, mean that they are
true, such that other possible approaches to understanding human existence are
excluded. Indeed, there are many alternatives, which are oft en incompatible with
one another. As any student of Heidegger’s work knows, it exhibits unusual depth
and originality; likewise, the distinctions that Erhard deployed in the Training and
The Forum have elicited from many thousands of people an experience of the
clearing that is central to Heidegger’s thinking. I hope that the book that Hyde and
Kopp have written will be the first of many other investigations into the ontology of
human existence and into how we can elicit experiential insight into that ontology.
The question concerning Heidegger’s
Politics
Let me now pose a second and final question: Do revelations about Heidegger’s
d
far-right-wing political views negate the value of all his work and disqualify him as a
philosopher?
Martin Heidegger settled on a philosophical career only aft er health concerns
required him to end his Jesuit novitiate. He remained drawn to the mysticism of
Meister Eckhart, avidly read the works of Luther, and was influenced by Gnosticism.
In Being and Time Heidegger drew on such sources, and many others, in describing
humankind as “thrown” and “fallen,” fleeing from finite openness and from the
concrete possibilities disclosed therein, embracing instead routinized everyday
practices, and being seduced by countless distractions aimed at concealing who we
really are. This book revolutionized twentieth-century European philosophy, and
Heidegger had a dramatic eff ect on students, many of whom were Jews, such as
Hannah Arendt, Herbert Marcuse, Helena Weiss, Hans Jonas, and Karl Löwith.
These students were understandably shocked when in 1933 Heidegger publicly
announced his allegiance to National Socialism. Caught up in the ecstatic revo-
lutionary moment, Heidegger used his own discourse of resolute authenticity to
encourage others to join him in supporting Adolph Hitler. For a few years Heidegger
was a devoted follower, but gradually became disenchanted with what one might
call the “really existing” Nazi party, which he came to regard as another version
of the same techno-industrial nihilism that in his perspective animated American
capitalism and Soviet Marxism. Nevertheless, he remained attached to the idea
that National Socialism had contained an “inner truth and greatness” that had
been perverted by leaders who were not up to the task. Showing little sympathy for
Heidegger’s attempted self-justification, however, the Allies in charge of post-war
de-Nazification hearings concluded that his complicity with the Nazi regime made
him unfit for teaching. He was removed from his post at the University of Freiburg.
Ever since then, controversy has raged about the extent to which the positive con-
tributions of Heidegger’s thought can be separated from his far-right-wing, arguably
anti-Semitic views.
I had always been concerned about his Nazi aff iliation, so much so that my first
published article bears the title “Heidegger, Ethics, and National Socialism.”13 At that
time, I tended to side with his supporters, who contended that one should distin-
guish between Heidegger the thinker and Heidegger the man, that is, the misguided
political activist. Critics, on the other hand, charged that his philosophy had much
in common with Nazi ideology. In the late 1980s publication of books demonstrating
the aff inity between important aspects of Heidegger’s thought and Nazi ideology led
me to rethink my attitude toward his philosophy, as I reported in my book, Heideg-
ger’s Confrontation with Modernity: Technology, Politics, Art. 14
In that book, I argued that Heidegger’s notion of the “history of being” had
much in common with views promoted by various Nazi ideologues and pro-Nazi phi-
losophers. According to Heidegger, modernity is the final stage in the long decline of
Aft erword 539
Western civilization from its grand beginning in ancient Greece. Techno-industrial
modernity brings to a culmination the nihilistic history of the West. It is worth
noting, as Berkeley philosopher Hans Sluga has pointed out, that Heidegger was
only one of many German philosophers who became either outright Nazis or else
fellow travellers.15 Many academic humanists of the era—German, French, English,
Spanish, Italian—agreed with Heidegger that modernity was a colossal misstep,
which promoted the revolt of the masses. Of course, Heidegger’s already elevated
philosophical status meant that his conversion had greater significance at a time
when the Nazi regime still sought cultural legitimation. It is also worth noting that
much of what he says about techno-industrial modernity, namely, that it reduces
nature to mere raw material and humankind to resources demanded by the pow-
er-seeking system, is remarkably similar to what was said around the same time by
leading members of the left -wing Frankfurt School, including Theodor Adorno and
Max Horkheimer.
Heidegger’s view of Western history as leading to nihilism stands in stark
contrast to progressive interpretations, initiated by French Enlightenment thinkers,
as well as by G.W.F. Hegel, Marx, and many other nineteenth- and twentieth-century
European and American political theorists, according to which history leads to
emancipation from ignorance and unjust political authority, and to scientific knowl-
edge that promises relief from human misery. Heidegger’s anti-modernist attitudes
were similar in some ways to those held by Nietzsche. Both thinkers became major
influences on post-modern theory, which depicts modernity in ways that at times
have much in common with anti-modernist views that prevailed in Germany in the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
Despite his rejection of modernity and his embrace of the far-right Nazi par-
ty, Heidegger carefully avoided anti-Semitic statements in his published works.
Subsequent historical research has showed, however, that while he was Rektor of
the University of Freiburg (1933–34), he made such statements in off icial letters and
engaged in some anti-Jewish activity.
The ongoing publication of the Black Notebooks, which Heidegger began to
compose in the 1930s, brings the political controversy to a new stage. In these Note-
books, now appearing in his Gesamtausgabe (Collected Works), Heidegger writes that
European Jewry played a significant role in the rise of “calculative” thinking, which
he held responsible for modernity’s disclosure of everything as mere means for en-
hancing power. At times, he suggested that the Jews were somehow responsible for
the rise of such thinking, but at other times he indicated that the Jews were pawns
in the process by which the Being of entities had concealed itself, with the result that
entities (including humans) had been gradually reduced to sheer
instrumentality.
For Heidegger, human existence opens up the clearing in which entities can
manifest themselves and in this sense “be.” Supposedly, the ancient Greeks were
opened up in a way that allowed entities to stand forth, to reveal themselves in
ways that gave rise to incomparable beauty and terrible violence. Gradually, how-
ever, the clearing that constitutes human existence began to become constricted,
beginning already with Plato and Aristotle (!). Hence, the Being of entities could re-
veal itself in ever more limited ways. Instead of existing so as to let entities be man-
ifest in their own ways, humankind asserted itself as the human subject, arrogating
to itself the right to dominate the planet. Such violent self-assertion, according to
Heidegger, results not from a merely human decision, but instead from eff acement
of the Being of entities. In addition to blaming the Jews for this outcome, he also
assigns responsibility for it to the Catholic Church, American capitalism, Soviet
Marxism, scientism, democracy, and other institutions. In some ways, Heidegger
was an equal-opportunity denouncer.
Heidegger goes so far as to suggest that the death camps, however terrible their
outcome was for Jews, were the products of the very same calculative, instrumen-
tal, power-driven thinking that they had promulgated. Today, we would call this
“blaming the victims.” That he held such a view helps to explain, at last, his silence
about the Holocaust. We may be charitable in saying that he did not endorse the
death camps, but he did not speak out against them, even aft er the war, much to the
consternation of his Jewish students as well as many other philosophers who had
learned from Heidegger’s publications.
Anti-Semitism was widespread in Europe and America in the decades leading
up to World War II. It became particularly ferocious in Germany for many diff erent
reasons, one of them being that emancipated Jews turned out to be exceptionally
intelligent, capable, and hard-working, thereby winning positions of influence in
academia, medicine, law, and business. These achievements, presumably unexpect-
ed by a German population still harboring anti-Semitic views, provoked widespread
ressentiment, as Nietzsche put it. Germany’s defeat in World War I, accusations of
internal betrayal that led to that outcome, the punitive treaty at Versailles, the Great
Inflation followed by Great Depression, widespread street fighting between Nazi
Brownshirts and communists, and the perceived political gridlock arising from the
democratic Weimar regime, helped to create the conditions that allowed for a char-
ismatic demagogue like Hitler to seize power by blaming Jews for Germany’s misery.
Describing these social, political, and economic conditions, however, does not
540
SPEAKING BEING
remove personal responsibility for Heidegger and others who chose to side with the
Nazis and who tolerated the violence they wreaked on millions of innocent people.
There has already been a virtual tidal wave of commentary addressing the
question  of Heidegger’s anti-Semitism,  most recently as it appears in his Black
Notebooks.16  Some scholars conclude that Heidegger’s should no longer be
taught or studied, because it is allegedly “contaminated” with far-right-wing and
anti-Semitic views. My own view is that Heidegger’s philosophical gift s were so great
that we would make a mistake to boot him out of the philosophical cannon, any
more than we should exclude Wagner from the musical canon, even though his
anti-Semitic attitudes may be discerned on occasion in some of his greatest operas,
not to mention in his published essays. In both cases, we must read and listen with
discernment, with recognition that even brilliant philosophical work and stirring
musical compositions may contain dark and dangerous aspects.
Publication of the Black Notebooks ought to be an occasion for reflection about
the anti-Semitic and racist views that characterized much of the Western world, es-
pecially in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Recent work on American slavery
has demonstrated that this dreadful industrial regime provided the wealth needed
for capitalism to get up a head of steam by the middle of the nineteenth century.17
American and European colonialism, justified by white supremacist notions of “the
white man’s burdens,” included practices that we should look back upon with hor-
ror. Heidegger belonged to a version of that white supremacist world, even though
he adhered not to biological racism, but instead to a kind of metaphysical-linguistic
racism focused on the exceptionalism of the ancient Greeks and the German Volk.
Racist views, to be sure, were held by many, including those whom we otherwise
revere. The recent controversy over public display of the Confederate flag in some
Southern states demonstrates the cultural staying power of anti-modernism, includ-
ing white supremacy.
Heidegger should continue to be studied and appreciated for his important
philosophical contributions, especially work from the era of Being and Time, which
proves most important for understanding the parallels between Erhard’s work and
Heidegger’s. His later writings, including his powerful reflections on the nature of
language, and his eff ort to understand the essence of modern technology, also merit
attention, though they should be read while keeping in mind that they sometimes
entwined themselves with his far-right-wing political views.
One of the things that struck some of Heidegger’s students when reading Being
and Time was this: What should be the content of decisions made within the light of
t
resolute authenticity?  I am resolved, but resolved to do what? Heidegger answered
that question for himself in the early 1930s by becoming a Nazi. According to him,
only the situation itself makes clear what is called for. For him, then, authenticity
was consistent with being a Nazi, which for Heidegger also meant taking a stand
against Soviet Marxism, which he regarded as a mortal threat to Western civilization.
The inconceivable atrocities of the Holocaust seem to annul the validity of Heideg-
ger’s decision to support Nazism, even if his concern about Soviet Marxism may have
been justified. Throughout history, people have committed violence when they felt
duty-bound to fulfill some great task. There is no guarantee that anything we choose
to do now, even in moments of apparent clarity, will later prove morally praisewor-
thy.18 Heidegger joined a movement that provoked World War II and killed millions of
people in concentration camps. Presumably, readers of this book would agree that
at some point before he died, or even posthumously, Heidegger should have off ered
some expression of regret for his contributions to the Nazi movement. We can only
speculate about why he refused to do so, but one reason may be his inability to tell
the truth about his personal responsibility. Heidegger was a particular moral agent,
not the spokesperson for the “history of Being.”
Although Erhard’s Forum is apolitical, it is not morally neutral. Those who took
The Forum in the late 1980s, or The Landmark Forum up until the present, will recall
its emphasis on making a diff erence by contributing to the community. When Erhard
initiated the Hunger Project in the 1970s, his goal was to demonstrate that we could
end the conversation that holds hunger to be inevitable. Instead, we can initiate a
new conversation, according to which hunger can be ended. Despite being criticized
in some circles, the Hunger Project was an important social, economic, and political
intervention. It invited people to commit to this proposition: We do not have to put
up with hunger. There is enough food, but we lack the conviction that hunger can
be eliminated. By changing our attitude toward hunger, we can end it, thus helping
to create a world that works for everyone. Or as Erhard would put it, by altering the
way hunger occurs for us as inevitable, so that it can occur for us as
r
endable, our
behavior related to hunger would also be altered.
Erhard would agree that life is dangerous. In taking a stand, we may end up
going astray, even though it made sense to take that stand at the moment. One
of the reasons that The Forum’s sharing is so important, however, is its revelation
that most people really want to make a diff erence that contributes to human well
being and—these days—to planetary well being, too. Creating and attempting to
bring to fruition possible and desirable futures—these are risky endeavors. Not only
can they fail, and usually will fail, but at times they will cause more harm than they
attempted to prevent. Recognizing this is an invitation to heed what others have to
Aft erword 541
say, especially those who are most critical about what we propose to do. Heedless
confidence in your own way of being the one that will perfect the world, as was the
case in totalitarian movements of the twentieth century, is almost certainly a recipe
for disaster. New worlds must be built together with people from a wide variety of
perspectives, pre-modern, modern, and post-modern.
*********
In the foregoing book, Hyde and Kopp have threaded the needle. They have showed
that Heidegger’s work has important parallels with ideas that Erhard arrived at on
his own, and they have done so in a way that leaves no room for ascribing either
far-right-wing or far-left -wing views to Erhard. Although he may be an existentialist,
he is also a modernist, unlike Heidegger.  I regard Speaking Being as an enormous-
ly important contribution to understanding Heidegger and Erhard. The latter has
received far too little serious academic attention, and this book begins to make up
for that lack. Moreover, the book’s analysis of Heidegger’s thought is among the best
that I have ever read. I commend this book to all readers without reservation.

In Heidegger and Theology (London and New York: 2014), Judith Wolfe shows that even
though Heidegger’s philosophy arose in constant critical dialogue with theology, Being and
Time analyzes finite human existence, without reference to God. Heidegger’s contention
that authentic existence involves Being-towards-death suggests an “eschatology without
eschaton.” In “The Facticity of Being God-Forsaken: The Young Heidegger and Luther’s
Theology of the Cross,” American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly, 79, 2 (2005), 273–290,
y
Sean J. McGrath argues that the task of phenomenology is to describe the Being of the fallen
human, and also to depict the extent to which finite, fallen existence can be authentic.
Theology’s eschatological concern with salvation and a possibly eternal aft erlife are not
matters of concern to philosophy, Heidegger concluded.
7
Humans are very good at recognizing patterns and making distinctions, but for patterns to
be experienced as meaningful, they must somehow matter to our Being-in-the-world. Our
r
existence is always at stake for us, which is what Heidegger meant by saying that the very
Being of humankind is care. Arguably, until computers exist in a clearing of their own, their
distinction-making—no matter how much faster than human distinction-making—will have
no significance for computers themselves. Computers are (not yet) at issue for themselves.
See Michael E. Zimmerman, “Heidegger on Techno-Posthumanism: Revolt against Finitude?
Or, Doing What Comes ‘Naturally’?” in Perfecting Human Futures: Technology, Secularization
and Eschatology, ed. J. Benjamin Hurlbut and Hava Tirosh-Samuelson (Dordrecht: Springer,
y
2015). In his books and many articles, Hubert Dreyfus has pioneered a Heideggerian critique of
Artificial Intelligence.

Something similar is true for certain interpretations of Christianity. When Jesus called his
followers “sons and daughters of God,” he aff irmed they were always already divine, although
y
cloaked in sin (analogous in some ways to rackets). As German philosopher G.W.F. Hegel put
it two centuries ago, in a controversial interpretation, Jesus was the first person to awaken to
his own divinity.
