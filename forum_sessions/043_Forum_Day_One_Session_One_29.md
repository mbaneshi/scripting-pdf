Forum Day One: Session One 29
Hesitantly, Bill sat down.
ERHARD
Do I take that to mean that you’ve chosen to be here?
BILL
Yes.
ERHARD (to the group)
All Bill’s doing is doing you a favor. He’s letting you see yourself. That’s an extraordinary gift,
to see yourself.
(turning back to Bill)
I want to apologize to you for saying things that you found off ensive. Do you accept my
apology?
BILL
Yes, I do.
ERHARD
I’m not clear you’re here because you chose to be here.
BILL
Yes. But I’m not clear if I’ll get the results.
ERHARD
And you won’t be. How The Forum works is you learn nothing. And then you learn more noth-
ing. And then you learn it all at once. It’s an all of a sudden phenomenon.
(pausing)
What we just went through is very important. I brought something to that conversation that’s
designed to leave you in a diff erent place about those conversations. I predict that when The
Forum is over you’ll tell me this was the most important experience in your whole life. We’ll
see. There’s a bit of a risk here, and I accept that.
Erhard fi nally left Bill, and addressed the group, moving among them.
ERHARD
Nobody participates in programs that I lead because they were pressured. A lot of people are
here because they’ve got reasons to be here. And I want you to know you’re not here because
of your reasons. You put yourself in that chair, and not your reasons. You’ve got a story called
force, and what actually happened was somebody spoke to you. If you live in a story called
force, your life will look like a response to force. See, most of you live in response to a story you
made up. You live in a sea of reasons. But I want you to be clear, you put yourself in that chair,
“
If you live in a story called force, your life
will look like a response to force.
NOTE: Please see the final conversation Erhard has with Bill
near the close of Session Three of Day Four.

SPEAKING BEING
not the reasons, nobody else and nothing else. And you have reasons. That’s what I mean by
people don’t know their ass from a hole in the ground. People don’t know what put them in that
chair. If you’re stuck with this idea that you were pressured, I want you out of here. I’m going
to say a lot of things in here and you’re only going to get them almost. I know that today you’re
going to get almost nothing I say, because you’re going to put it in the language in which you
dwell. Like “should.” I don’t dwell in the language of should. It’s patently obvious here. I’m
asking you who’s buried in Grant’s Tomb. This is not hard. You put yourself here.
A participant raised a question about a friend he wanted to do The Forum. He described the man.
PARTICIPANT
Would he feel pressured?
ERHARD
Yeah, because he’s an asshole.
PARTICIPANT (laughs)
Yeah, that’s true.
ERHARD
You see, you can’t pressure people who are straight. They give clear answers, like “no,” or
“don’t call me.” I invite people. I want to be clear what I mean by an invitation. An invitation
for me always carries with it the power to decline.
Erhard mounted the platform, and announced a break. However, he said, “in The Forum there are
no breaks,” so he gave the participants an assignment.
ERHARD
The assignment during the break is to sort out your “story” from “what happened.” Most people
live in the story and don’t live in the what happened. And there’s something disempowering
about living in the story instead of living in the what happened. The problem is that you are
thrown—that’s like already always—you are thrown to the story. You are addicted to the story.
“People don’t like me” and “being insulted” never happen. I’m going to demonstrate insulting.
I’m going to insult you: I insult you. For the fi rst time in your life you’ve now been insulted as a
what happened. All the other times, someone said something, and you got insulted. People have
t
said you’re a jerk. But that’s somebody saying “You’re a jerk.” The insult was a story.
t
Having given the assignment, Erhard called Julie, The Forum Supervisor, to the podium.
ERHARD
Julie’s the person who keeps this organized enough so that it can happen. So your cooperation
with her is in your interest.
