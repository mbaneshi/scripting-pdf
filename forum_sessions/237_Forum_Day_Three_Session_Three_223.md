Forum Day Three: Session Three 223
ERHARD
Yeah.
BETH
That I don’t take risks.
ERHARD
So what?
BETH
So what? I know...
ERHARD
I asked you fi rst. So what “you avoid risks”?
BETH
Yeah.
ERHARD
You avoid risks. You made that into some kind of crummy meaning. You know what? You
avoid risks. Okay. You turned it into a soap opera. You made it mean something. You put
violins in the back, and turned it into some meaning. What does it mean that you avoid risks?
It doesn’t mean anything. Rocks are hard. You know what that means? Nothing. They’re just
hard. You avoid risks. What does that mean? Nothing. I’m getting older. What does that mean?
Nothing. I didn’t succeed in life. What does that mean? Nothing. I had a divorce. What does
that mean? Nothing... but I had two divorces. What does that mean? Two nothings. But I’m
not worthy. So what you’re not worthy? You’re going to make a federal case out of it? You’re
not worthy. I got that. Now what? You want to make something out of it. It does not mean
anything! It’s meaningless. Does it mean something that rocks are hard? What about the
spirits-in the-rocks shit? More fucking voodoo.
(laughter)
Voodoo! You avoid risks. I got it. “Oh, but you don’t understand.” What you mean is, I don’t
get all the meaning and drama and turmoil and soap opera and the sadness and upset. You’re
right. I don’t get that. That’s your crap. What I get is that you avoid intimacy. I got that. Rocks
are hard. Water’s wet. And you avoid intimacy. And each one of those has an equal amount of
signifi cance. But you made a big deal out of avoiding intimacy. Turned it into a whole fucking
soap opera. You know, it’s back and forth. Sometimes Beth resists that and tries to be intimate.
And sometimes she succumbs to it and gives up the attempt to be intimate. She changes so that
she’s more intimate. Is that getting clearer?
BETH
Yeah. I’m going to take a risk.

SPEAKING BEING
BETH (to the group)
All available men: see me at the break.
ERHARD
Very good trolling. Have them line up.
(to the group)
There was a little something you didn’t get out of that.
Erhard held up his hands and stuck one index fi nger into the circled fi ngers of the other hand,
making a gesture indicating the sex act.
ERHARD
This is very signifi cant. God and that.
Erhard looked over at Angel, the participant who had shared the day before about being twice-
divorced.
ERHARD
What are you doing over there, Angel?
ANGEL (angrily)
What do you mean nothing means anything?
ERHARD (to Angel)
I didn’t say “nothing means anything.”
(making the sex-act gesture)
I said this... means this. Stand up.
(to the group)
How would you like to carry around what she carries around?
ANGEL
You gave me something yesterday, and you just now took it away.
ERHARD
And you turned it into shit when I gave to you. And I didn’t give it to you anyhow; you gave it
to your self, but then you turned it into shit, because you made it mean something, and now
you’ve got a new soap opera. The old soap opera was “I was divorced twice.” Now you got a new
soap opera. Can you not see that you’re stuck and you have a conversation with Kipp and me to
get unstuck? Then we bring up some new thing and then you get stuck again. You’re a series of
stucks, one after the other after the other after the other, making up stucks. Tell us your story
here. What is it that’s bothering you? Tell Kipp.
