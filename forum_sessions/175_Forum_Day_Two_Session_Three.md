Forum Day Two: Session Three
161
JANE
I remember that, but I remember more my stepmom coming into my life. And my mom dying.
ERHARD
Did you love your real mom?
JANE
I don’t really remember. I thought I did. I don’t remember her.
ERHARD
So is there anything incomplete with your real mother?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
You’re okay with her?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Your dad?
JANE
I’m complete with him.
ERHARD
Your stepmom?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
You notice the almost stupid “not”? She didn’t have to be stupid there. Not “I guess.” And that’s
from the beginning because she just showed up and you didn’t have a chance to build a relation-
ship. Like here’s your mother. Have you built a relationship since then?
JANE
Yeah.
beings do not, for the most part, subject our everyday actions
to analysis. We simply engage in the practices of our inherited
traditions, the tradition into which we have been thrown. But
our understanding of ourselves remains superficial: “Ontical-
ly, of course, Dasein is not only close to us—even that which
is closest. We are it, each of us, we ourselves. In spite of this,
or rather for just this reason, it is ontologically that which is
farthest” (BT 36
T
).
Dreyfus has proposed examples of the way we inherit
elements of this thrownness. A Japanese mother comforts her
baby in the manner of her culture, in quiet and soothing ways,
while her American counterpart stimulates her baby into more
active and vocal behaviors. These parenting choices are, in large
part, unconscious on the part of the mothers; they are simply
reproducing their cultures’ ways of being. Nevertheless, by
the time the infants are three to four months of age, they have
already learned to be Japanese and American infants (Being In
The World 17). In another example, Dreyfus proposes that all of
d
the implicit but important rules governing nonverbal behaviors,
which differ widely among cultures—such aspects of proxemics
as the appropriate distance to stand from others, the relative
desirability of direct eye contact, or the situational expectations
regarding touch—are learned by unconscious observation as we
mature within a culture (Being in the World 18). These rules be-
come inculcated long before we might explicitly reflect on them,
and by then, Dasein’s everyday existence is already determined
factically, along with the social moods that shape our options
for being with others in the world.
It is important here to note that thrownness, like other
ideas introduced by Heidegger to distinguish Dasein’s existence,
should not be interpreted as a negative state of Being. Given its
apparent limitations, this is counterintuitive, and challenging for
us to think. But such paradoxical languaging is crucial to under-
standing the thinking of both Heidegger and Erhard. Negative
conditions naturally lead to the human impulse...to “fix” them,
but both Heidegger and Werner Erhard propose a more unortho-
dox response. ■

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
So what’s incomplete there?
JANE
I don’t know. I have a relationship with her. But I don’t know what’s incomplete.
ERHARD
How old were you when she became your mother?
JANE
Four, or fi ve, or six.
ERHARD
Did you lose something back there?
JANE
Back when I was a kid?
ERHARD
Yeah.
JANE
Maybe I lost some respect for my dad.
ERHARD
I’m going to tell you a story and I want you to look inside the story and see what’s there for you.
Children have a bond of belonging and sometimes that gets broken. There’s this bond between
your parents and you, and then it gets broken. Did that happen for you?
JANE
I don’t think so.
ERHARD
Did it happen back then?
JANE
I don’t know.
ERHARD
Did you have a bond with your dad?
JANE
Yeah and she broke it.
