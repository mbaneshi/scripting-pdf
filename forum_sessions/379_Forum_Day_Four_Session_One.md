Forum Day Four: Session One

ERHARD
And that’s the way that is. And you know you can bitch and moan and complain, and all the
stuff  about that, or you can get that that is where the door is. A lot of people want to go out
there, and they go over and start kicking on the wall. Because they want to go out there! Fine,
the door is over there. You want to have your way, what you got to get is where the door is. And
where the door is, is that your father’s the boss. That’s how to get what you want is “my father’s
the boss.” If you try to get what you want through “my father’s the boss,” you go through the
door, instead of kicking your way through the wall. You have a much better chance getting
to what’s on the other side of the wall going through the door than kicking your way through
the wall. Yeah, you’ll get through the wall every once in a while, but you’ll also be left bloody.
Yeah, and the other thing is that it isn’t fair. Gravity isn’t fair. Shouldn’t old people get a break
from gravity? That’s what you sound like with that “life isn’t fair” shit. Okay fi ne. That’s where
the door is: The door is, “life isn’t fair.” You want to get where you’re going, you’ve got to go
through the door. Continuing to kick the wall is saying “life isn’t fair.” What is this conversa-
tion “Life isn’t fair”? What is it? What is the point? It’s another goddamned drama. Life isn’t
fair. Your father’s the boss, and you live with another adult. You ought to be equal. Too bad.
That’s not the way it turned out. Your father’s the boss, and you can get what you want—not
that you can always get what you want—but you got some power to get what you want, as long
as you go through the door. If you don’t go through the door you’re going to have to use force.
You’re going to have to make your father wrong, or run away, or fuck something up...
Even if I’m going through the door, but I’m being covert about it then I’m kicking down the
wall.
ERHARD
Exactly. And I didn’t say you shouldn’t use your wiles. Nothing wrong with buttering up the old
man.
(laughter)
You don’t want to defi ne everything. “Okay, now we’re going to do foreplay, are you ready?”
It’s not a good approach. So yeah, covert is one thing, and playing the game is another thing.
You’re allowed to play the game and that will work.
SALLY
Being covert won’t work?
ERHARD
No. Being covert doesn’t work. That’s like trying to put one over on somebody. But playing with
people works. Particularly with fathers with their daughters. Fathers are easy with their daugh-
ters, except when the daughter tries to kick through the wall, right? Okay, you can sit down.

SPEAKING BEING
GLORIA
I keep trying to bring morality into this.
ERHARD
The drama of morality...
GLORIA
Like what she said: If life is empty and meaningless, why produce?
ERHARD
Why produce if life is empty and meaningless?
GLORIA
Not if...
ERHARD
Given that life is empty and meaningless, why produce? There is no reason to produce. Except
for one thing, Gloria: You did not hear that life was empty and meaningless. You’ve been in
a conversation with other people and not with me. See, “life is empty and meaningless” does
not tell you what to do with your life. It gives you no guidance at all, none. My “empty and
meaningless” is worthless. Your “empty and meaningless” gives you guidance. So your “empty
and meaningless” tells you that going on is worthless. My “empty and meaningless” tells me
nothing, gives no prescriptions, explains nothing, justifi es nothing. That’s the “empty and
meaningless” we’re talking about here. The “empty and meaningless” you’re talking about is
not the one I’m talking about. Out of your “empty and meaningless” you get a meaning about
what you should do, you get a prescription for what you should do for your life. My “empty and
meaningless” has no prescriptions in it. You went to the seminar on the other side of the wall.
Over there they got a seminar about empty and meaningless and it tells you what to do with
your life.
GLORIA
I can understand it intellectually.
ERHARD
What does that mean “intellectually”? I don’t understand “intellectually.”
GLORIA
I understand it makes sense.
