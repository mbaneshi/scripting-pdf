SPEAKING BEING
Nevertheless, despite its challenges, we assert that Being is
also the most important thing that one could talk about, since
talk that evokes Being has the ability to transform talk about
everything else.
A fundamental difference in this arena is the distinction
between ontological and
l
ontic inquiry. Ontological inquiry is
concerned primarily with Being. Therefore all of Heidegger’s
writing, and all of the dialogue of The Forum, is ontological in
nature. Ontic inquiry is concerned with beings, and with facts
about them. Therefore all of our everyday conversations—
everything from political discourse to casual social chat—may be
seen as ontic.
This is not to dismiss ontic inquiry as unimportant, or to
equate a discussion of religion or physics with coffeeshop banter.
We are not claiming that ontological inquiry is better, but that
it is essentially different. And in the experience of the authors,
it is profoundly interesting because of its transformational
possibilities. In this book, we will illuminate the nature of
ontological inquiry.
A prefatory note: people who write about Heidegger’s
work differ as to whether the term Being should be capitalized.
This is, of course, a choice for translators and not one that
confronted Heidegger, since in German all nouns are capitalized.
It is a problematic choice because capitalization tends to reify
or even deify, suggesting to some scholars that Being is “an
eternal metaphysical foundation or eternal principle,” while
for Heidegger it was “the event in which an entity reveals or
t
shows itself” (Michael E. Zimmerman, Heidegger’s Confrontation
with Modernity: Technology, Politics, Art xxii). Others feel that
t
capitalization is important so that what it means to exist (Being)
is not confused with the entities that exist (beings) (Richard Polt
Heidegger: An Introduction 3).
In print, Erhard himself did not capitalize the term: a 1985
Forum brochure states that the purpose of The Forum is to
provide participants with “direct access to the domain of being
itself.” In his more recent work, such as documents outlining
I want to make now is that whatever it is that you’re feeling, or whatever it is that you’re
thinking, or whatever your mental state is, or whatever your perception is, the way you are
viewing things—that’s exactly the way it ought to be. I’m going to probably have to say that
to you ten times, because you won’t remember that.
(to the group)
Another way you already always are is stupid about yourself. If that sounded a little bit like an
insult, you got it right. You may not be able to see that about yourself, but you’ll be able to see it
about others. As I said: not you, but other people.
(laughter)
There are ways of being with yourself that are disempowering and disenabling. You lose power
and you lose ability. Whatever way you fi nd yourself now, and whatever ways you fi nd yourself
variously throughout The Forum or in the evenings, or on the breaks: that’s the way you’re sup-
posed to be—whatever way that is. One way to disempower or disenable yourself is to question
whether you are being the right way... You’ll get a lot more out of The Forum a lot faster if you
let yourself be the way you are.
(pausing)
There’s a lot of this you’re not going to get. Some of it won’t make any sense. You’re not going
to get the whole Forum. The questions we’re asking in here are too powerful to get it all. The
Forum leaders are still getting it. So am I. But there are parts when you need to get it. In those
parts, put up your hand if you don’t. There will be a lot of repetition in here, too. For the fourth
time: you should be the way you are! However you feel, that’s the way it ought to be. The way
I know that is, that’s the way it is... The only right way to do The Forum is to be the way you’re
being. If you say you shouldn’t be pessimistic, you’re getting in your way.
A participant complained that she was distracted by and resentful about the physical set-up for this
Forum—the cameras, the observers, etc.
ERHARD
What you want to get out of that is that life is upsetting because it isn’t the way you expected it
to be. The Forum will be that way also. What you want to get out of that is that you’re already
upset. You’re already always upset at any change, at anything that violates your expectations.
You think you’re not upset until something violates your expectations. I said this strange thing:
you are already always upset. You live upset. I know you don’t believe that and I’m not asking
you to. You’re an upset waiting to happen. You’ll see that more clearly as we proceed.
LYNETTE
I’m often upset.
ERHARD
You’re always upset, and sometimes you notice it.
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day One: Session One
11
LYNETTE
Do you have any more advice about how to get the most out of this?
ERHARD
I do and we’ll go over that this morning.
TRENT
I hear there are Forum leaders here.
ERHARD
Forum leaders are here as part of their job.
TRENT
Four consecutive days instead of two weekends?
ERHARD
We’ve done this using odd schedules in diff erent settings, for instance, in  prisons.
BLAKE (who expressed reservations about speaking)
Continuing what you were saying as far as upset is concerned, and always being with you. My
barrier is the fear of revealing who I am. I should accept that.
ERHARD
Whatever you think is in the way, especially those things you think are part of the circum-
stances—for instance, you don’t get along with your boss and it’s quite clear to you that’s
because you work for a jerk—bring that in here. Blake is clear that it’s something he carries
around with him; it doesn’t come out of the circumstances. That’s easy. It’s the stuff  you think
is a product of the circumstances. So if there are circumstances in here, for instance, because
there are people observing—that sounds like it is a product of the circumstances.
CHRISSY
You talked about being in The Forum whatever way you are being. What about outside
The Forum?
ERHARD
Let yourself be like you are in those parts of The Forum that are outside The Forum, for
homework assignments during the breaks, etc. If that’s your mood at the moment, don’t try to
change it. You want it there because if it isn’t there it’s not going to get dealt with—particularly
those things you think are part of the circumstances: bring that in here. Most of what you do
outside The Forum in the next four days is going to be inside The Forum. If you do something
to avoid that, then you’ve successfully avoided that once more. See, there’s a lot of this you’re
his development of an ontological/phenomenological model of
leadership (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/ cf_dev/ AbsByAuth.
cfm?per_id=433651), he continues to employ the lowercase.
In this book, we will employ capitalization in those instances
where it clarifies the word’s meaning in a specific sentence.
We raise the point here to emphasize the unique nature of the
issues that arise in any discussion, oral or written, of this subject.
Being/being, as an ontological phenomenon, defies grammatical
categorization. ■
NOTE:  As of 2019, Landmark Worldwide’s Forum leader
faculty included more than 60 people, representing a diver-
sity in gender and race, and hailing from countries including
the United States of America, India, Japan, Australia,
New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Canada, Israel, the
Netherlands and Switzerland.

SPEAKING BEING
not going to like. You’re sitting there now with a whole bunch of assessments and conclusions.
We’ve done this a lot. I can even tell you what your assessments and conclusions are.
A participant asked whether, based on all of this, he should keep his specifi c issues and concerns
foremost in his mind.
ERHARD
You don’t need to have something you’re kind of holding in place. We will hook what’s there
in you that’s appropriate to be hooked and pull it up to the surface. So you can kind of relax
about that. A lot of stuff  you won’t even think about will get handled in here.
Another participant asked about the history of the organization.
ERHARD
We’ve been doing this work since 1971 and it was at the end of 1984 that we fi nished a four-
year process of developing The Forum, and we’ve been off ering The Forum since 1985 all over
this country, and in lots of other countries around the world.
At this point, a man named Jake rose to complain about the purpose of the evening session, to
which participants had been encouraged to invite guests.
JAKE
Isn’t that more for Werner Erhard and Associates to hustle more members?
ERHARD
You know that you are a hustle waiting to happen, right?
JAKE
I said I feel like I’m being hustled.
ERHARD
I said you are a guy who is being hustled waiting to happen.
JAKE
I don’t mind being hustled.
ERHARD
I said you are a guy who is being hustled waiting to happen.
JAKE
I don’t see it that way.
Erhard came down from the stage and sat on the edge of the platform near him.
Dasein
At the outset, it is important to introduce a term that is central
in Martin Heidegger’s work, and will therefore begin to come up
here almost immediately.
Dasein is Heidegger’s word for the Being of human beings,
and is one of the few terms in English editions of his writing
that consistently remain untranslated from the German. In
fact, the 2014 Dictionary of Untranslatables, published by
Princeton University Press, calls the word “a paradigm of the
untranslatable,” and devotes six double-columned pages to a
struggle to explain it (Adam Gopnik, “Word Magic,” New Yorker,.
May 26, 2014, 37).
A problem with translating this term, of course, is that term
is central in Heidegger’s most important work, Being and Time,
in which he presents his ontological model of human beings.
The specific elements of this model will be discussed in further
detail as we proceed. For now, it is sufficient to note that Dasein
will be spoken of as if the term indicates an individual; but since
it indicates the Being of that individual, it refers at the same time
more broadly to the collective Being of human beings.
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day One: Session One
13
ERHARD
You’re oriented around being hustled. You would see hustle where other people wouldn’t be
smart enough to see it.
JAKE
I could go along with that.
ERHARD
You are a guy who is being hustled waiting to happen. Remember I said people are upset wait-
ing to happen? You’re hustle waiting to happen.
JAKE
I’m still not getting it.
ERHARD
Okay good, then we’ll keep doing it until you do get it.
JAKE
In front of all these people?
ERHARD
Sure. You see hustle where others don’t. You are already always being hustled. You are waiting
for it to happen. You wake up that way in the morning, you just don’t have the circumstances to
express it yet.
JAKE
I think I see that... I am. I’m on the watch-out. I watch my bucks.
ERHARD
I’ve already got your bucks, don’t I? Before this is over I’m going to get some more of your
bucks.
JAKE
That’s a challenge.
ERHARD
With you, I’d almost bet on it.
He remained seated on the edge of the platform as this interaction modulated from confrontational
to friendly.
14
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (continuing)
That by the way was meant as a compliment. I’m going to off er you an opportunity to do this
for the rest of your life, because I’m clear that you’re going to get a lot of value out of this and
I’m going to off er you the opportunity to get more value. You will always have the power to
decline. I want you to know that’s there in the relationship between me and you. I have no
reluctance to hustling you, because you always have the power to decline. Is that clear?
JAKE
Yeah, I got it.
The fi rst morning of The Forum continued as a dialogue with the group as Erhard responded to
participants’ questions. One woman expressed a concern that the content would go “over her head.”
ERHARD
Most of what I say is not designed for your head. Understanding is not the problem in life. If
you took a four-day course in how to be a tennis player and you left the course as a great tennis
player without understanding a word of it, the diff erence would be your being a great tennis
player. We don’t promise you any understanding. You’re welcome to understand. I like this
stuff , so I enjoy understanding it. That’s a quirk in me. We do this so that there’s a freedom
to be. If you walk out understanding, that’s the booby prize. You walk out of here with the
freedom to be that you didn’t have when you walked in here, then you got something for your
money. Speaking in here is designed to create the freedom to be... You don’t understand what
that means. What interests me is the freedom to be. You’ll be interested in that too before this
is over. I’ve done The Forum before so I know it works out.
A woman stated that she was already always nervous.
ERHARD (to the group)
How many people in here are already always nervous?
(most raising their hands)
You understand that the things that are going on with you are going on with everybody? You’re
like a rainstorm. You’ve got to get that there’s nothing personal about a rainstorm—that is,
that it waters the little fl owers. You think that the rainstorm is worried about life on earth. You
think that it rains so that... it rains in-order-to. It’s true that life is sustained by the rain, but it’s
not true that it rains in-order-to.
SAL (standing up, receiving a microphone)
You’re just arguing semantics.
ERHARD
No, it’s not semantics. Or the other answer to that is, yes it’s semantics, but so is everything else
in the universe.
Two Theses
The first thesis of this book, which will be addressed directly in
the text, is that the work of Werner Erhard is aligned in important
ways with the thinking of Martin Heidegger. Our purpose is to
show this alignment through a comparative analysis of their work,
an analysis that not only illuminates the thinking of both men, but
sheds light as well on the nature of their shared central concern.
The second thesis, equal in importance to the first, cannot
be addressed directly in the text. We have indicated it with the
term Being, since unless we indicate it we cannot talk about it—as
Heidegger puts it, “one cannot get by in public without rubrics”
(OWL 29). But the term serves merely as a place-holder, since
what it indicates cannot be thought, or even thought about, in our
Forum Day One: Session One
15
SAL
I believe that when it rains it rains in order to sustain life.
ERHARD
Okay, let’s stay there. Anybody else in that ballpark with Sal? Stand up if you are. Stand up if it
rains in-order-to.
(a number of people rose)
If you’re not standing and you are an in-order-to, you’re interfering with your participation in
The Forum. These people who are standing are not silly. They’ve got their foot nailed to the
fl oor someplace. This will happen to all of you a lot of times during The Forum.
(to Sal, indicating the director’s chair on the platform)
Are the legs there to hold up the chair? We know that the legs do hold up the chair. For the legs,
is there any in-order-to? Are the legs in-ordering-to?
(pausing)
It’s too hard that way... let me try something diff erent. Is the wall standing in order to hold the
ceiling up?
SAL
Yes, in my opinion.
ERHARD
Does the lightning lightning in order to start forest fi res?
SAL
No.
ERHARD
Where is this organ of intentionality in the rainstorm?
SAL
The spirituality of the universe.
ERHARD  (to the group)
He just told me where his foot’s nailed to the fl oor. He’s got something he believes so he can’t
think about it.
(to Sal)
You think there’s an intentionality in the rainstorm. You said it’s your belief that matter was
invaded by spirit in some way. Does it rain in order to produce fl oods?
usual way of conceptualizing. Think “freedom” and a conceptual
barrage is evoked; think “Being” and the mind’s resources are few.
Our second thesis, since it eludes capture in concepts,
can only be hinted at. It exists always as a background,
in a domain of language that remains always unspoken.
Unspoken, it is the unexamined context that shapes the way we
understand everything else; unspoken, it is made present as
the transformational background in the dialogue of The Forum;
unspoken, it is hinted at persistently in Heidegger’s writing and in
his lectures. Our second thesis, then, is this unspoken domain of
language, formally referred to as the ontological realm.
In this book, to show what Werner Erhard and Martin
Heidegger are doing in their work, the authors are called upon
to say—to hint at—the unspoken shared dynamic at the center
of that work. Inevitably, an element of mystery attends this
topic; but nothing here is devious or arcane. While ontological
communication makes rigorous demands on our everyday
understanding, Erhard’s work is a practical pedagogical
methodology, demonstrating that education beyond the merely
epistemological is a real-world possibility.
The authors intend that our second thesis will be
communicated in the background as we proceed through this
book, leaving the reader with a hint of its nature as it emerges in
The Forum.
One aspect of this background communication is that
unfamiliar terms or concepts may not be fully defined at the
point of their first appearance. Rather, they will be distinguished
gradually as they appear and reappear in the text. A definition
specifies conceptual limits; a distinction opens a space for
thinking and acting, and the space is expanded each time the
distinction is encountered. The goal of the inquiry, then, is
never an answer, but the opening of a question from which
to experience the world. We invite the reader to embrace the
freedom that this background of questionability gives: at play in
the question, you don’t need the right answer.  ■
16
SPEAKING BEING
SAL
No.
ERHARD
So the intentionality organ is not operating when it produces fl oods?
SAL
No, that just happens.
ERHARD
But it doesn’t just happen that when it rains life is sustained? Remember, Sal, there’s no ques-
tion between you and me that water does sustain life. The  question is: does it rain in-order-to?
Or does it just happen, and by the way, it sustains life?
At this point Sal seemed to see Erhard’s point, and sat down.
ERHARD (to Sal)
Okay. Now, just something personal between you and me. I’ve done this a lot. There’s some-
thing I appreciated about you in this conversation. You were open in the conversation.
(to the group)
Nobody’s ever going to win with me in here. Because this is my game, and only an asshole
would try to win in another guy’s game. You and I had a discussion where we got something
t
together. Rain is impersonal. We weren’t talking about a higher order of things. I don’t want
anybody to believe anything I say. And I’m not interested in sustaining anything you believe.
BLAKE (recalling what had happened up to this moment in the conversation)
I know that there was some sequence and I missed it. I mentioned that I was nervous, that I
didn’t like it, and then we were talking about the rain.
ERHARD (to the group)
He just demonstrated not knowing, being clear he didn’t know. That’s diff erent from being con-
fused. This is one of those things to get. There’s a diff erence between knowing that you don’t
understand, knowing that you didn’t follow something; knowing something didn’t make sense
and being confused are very diff erent. You didn’t invent being nervous. Even though the rain is
impersonal, you do personally get wet. The same thing goes for being nervous. Being nervous
is part of being human. Being human doesn’t belong to you; you belong to it. You didn’t invent
being human. You were late for the party. Being human is an already always way of being that
you walked into. It’s like a rainstorm, and it’s true you personally got wet. You are a human
Ontologic al Dialogue
A striking aspect of Erhard’s method, one which appears again
and again throughout The Forum, is his persistence in pressing
any interaction or any topic of discussion through to completion.
Complete, for Erhard, does not mean simply finished, but rather
whole, and lacking none of its essential parts. Repeatedly, after
he has been engaged on a particular point with an individual, he
requests that others in the room who are not clear on that point
stand, and works with each participant individually until all of
them have “gotten” it for themselves. Erhard often uses the term
“flatten” in the same sense, as in “Let’s get that one flat before
we move on.” To get something flat, in an ontological dialogue,
means that the item in question has been moved beyond a purely
conceptual level of understanding, and has been distinguished
as an ontological possibility, at least in a preliminary sense. The
distinction will continue to be teased out as The Forum proceeds,
ultimately becoming a clearing for Being; but the first step in that
process is to flatten the concept, so that its ontological possibility
can be heard.
Of course, “getting it” and “being complete” might be
read as “having surrendered to Erhard’s point of view.” Erhard
himself seemed to support this interpretation, telling one Forum
participant Blake, “Nobody’s ever going to win with me in here.
Because this is my game, and only an asshole would try to win in
another guy’s game.” During a debriefing session with The Forum
leaders regarding their role in the dialogue, Erhard again referred
to the process in agonistic terms: “You’ve got to have some
appreciation for the advantage you’ve got there,” he said. “And
yeah, you’re going to use the advantage, that’s part of the game.”

being, but you didn’t make up human being. You didn’t invent being nervous. You didn’t invent
having a barrier to expressing yourself. That doesn’t belong to you. That’s not yours. That’s in
the already always being of human being. It doesn’t belong to you; you belong to it.
(forcefully)
It owns you! You don’t own it. Being nervous owns your life. You don’t own being nervous. The
metaphor is that there’s nothing personal about a rainstorm. It just rains, and I, you, personally
get wet. But the rainstorm didn’t rain in order to get me wet. Being nervous is already always
there in the being of being human. And you and I walk out into that rainstorm and get wet...
In The Forum, you get back the power to say something about your own way of being. Now
you can only report on it. But you can’t say “I’m not nervous” and have it make any diff erence.
After The Forum you will be able to.
BLAKE
I’m not as nervous as when I first stood up. I am here to make a change, find a new occupa-
tion, to get up in front of people. What it requires is getting up.
ERHARD
Not necessarily.
BLAKE
Well, I don’t know.
ERHARD
That’s right. And I do know.
BLAKE
That’s why I’m asking you.
ERHARD
I want to get it settled because you’re going to keep saying those stupid kinds of things: what
you have to do and what you don’t have to do for this to work. And the answer is you don’t
know. So I’m gonna tell you: what you have to do is what you do. So you’ll always know what
you have to do because you’re doing what you’re doing. To do something you’re not doing:
that’s bad. If you do what you do it’ll all work out. One of the things that you are doing is think-
ing you have to stand up. That’s fi ne for you to think that. You wanna know why I think it’s
fi ne for him to think that? Because that’s what he’s thinking.
BLAKE
You’re right. At some point you broke through whatever was in the way and now you’re up
there doing what you are doing.
The game in The Forum is the evocation of the presence
of Being, and The Forum leader’s opponent is the way of being
that we in the technological age have been born into (the way
we wound up being). Clearly, there is a certain direction which
must be maintained in The Forum dialogue if its purpose is
to be achieved. The maintenance of this direction in the face
of participants’ resistance might appear, to the everyday
understanding, as motivated by a need on The Forum leader’s
part to win the game, so that The Forum’s perspective is shown
to be the true one. However, accepted in The Forum is that The
Forum leader’s responsibility is maintaining the ontological
character of the conversation. “My job,” said Erhard, “is to
manage the dialogue.” This management is not a matter of
winning, but of keeping the way in view. In a recent conversation
with the authors, Erhard put it this way: “I used this way of
speaking to deal with people who are resisting in order to resist,
rather than functioning in a dialogue.”
Any discussion of dialogue as pedagogy must always consider
the question of mutuality, and this is especially delicate when the
dialogue’s purpose is the presencing of Being. The Forum leaders’
rank in The Forum dialogue is given by their ability to listen to
the conversation from a certain perspective. As Erhard told The
Forum leaders, “You’ve got to know that an authentic dialogue is
going to generate clarity. You’ve also got to watch you don’t get
hooked. What hooks [you] is when someone says something that
you think puts you at a disadvantage.” Being hooked, for a Forum
leader, means being drawn into argument or commiseration with
participants’ stories about their lives, rather than maintaining
the transformed perspective given by The Forum’s ontological
distinctions. It is The Forum leader’s job not to get hooked.
This balance between mutuality and directedness in an
ontological dialogue is an important matter. Obviously, there is
a thrust to such a dialogue—a movement of the conversation in
the direction of its ontological intention. In his dialogue with the
Japanese scholar in On the Way to Language, Heidegger points
to the nature of true dialogue when he states that “we may

تحقیق هستی شناختی. یک یادداشت مقدماتی: افرادی که در مورد هایدگر می نویسند
کار در مورد اینکه آیا این اصطلاح باید سرمایه گذاری شود متفاوت است. این البته انتخابی برای مترجمان است و نه یکی که
با هایدگر روبرو شد ، زیرا در آلمانی همه اسم ها سرمایه گذاری می شوند. این یک انتخاب مشکل ساز است زیرا سرمایه گذاری تمایل به تجدید نظر دارد

برای هایدگر این "رویدادی بود که یک موجود در آن فاش می کند یا

این که آیا شما راه درستی دارید ... اگر شما خیلی سریعتر از انجمن خارج خواهید شد

بسیاری از این موارد را که نمی خواهید بدست آورید. برخی از آن معنی نخواهد داشت. شما نمی روید
برای به دست آوردن کل انجمن سؤالاتی که ما در اینجا می خواهیم بسیار قدرتمند هستند تا همه آن را بدست آورند. در
رهبران انجمن هنوز در حال دریافت آن هستند. بنابراین من هستم. اما در صورت نیاز به دریافت قسمت هایی وجود دارد. در آن

من می دانم که ، این همان روشی است که ... تنها راه درست برای انجام انجمن این است که به روشی باشید که شما هستید
بودن اگر می گویید نباید بدبین باشید ، در راه خود هستید. یک شرکت کننده شکایت کرد که وی از مجموعه فیزیکی برای این کار حواس پرت شده و ناراحت است
انجمن - دوربین ها ، ناظران و غیره erhard
آنچه می خواهید از این امر خارج شوید این است که زندگی ناراحت کننده است زیرا این راهی نیست که شما انتظار دارید
بودن این انجمن نیز به این ترتیب خواهد بود. آنچه می خواهید از آن خارج شوید این است که شما قبلاً هستید
ناراحت شما در حال حاضر همیشه از هر تغییری ناراحت هستید ، به هر چیزی که انتظارات شما را نقض می کند. شما فکر می کنید تا زمانی که چیزی انتظارات شما را نقض نکند ، ناراحت نیستید. من این چیز عجیب را گفتم:
شما همیشه ناراحت هستید. شما زندگی می کنید من می دانم که شما این را باور نمی کنید و من نمی پرسم
تو به شما منتظر هستید که اتفاق بیفتد. با ادامه کار این مسئله را واضح تر خواهید دید. لینت
من اغلب ناراحتم درز
شما همیشه ناراحت هستید ، و گاهی اوقات متوجه آن می شوید. erhard (ادامه)

ما این کار را با استفاده از برنامه های عجیب و غریب در تنظیمات مختلف ، به عنوان مثال ، در زندان ها انجام داده ایم. بلیک (که در مورد صحبت کردن ابراز رزرو کرد)

هرچه فکر می کنید در راه است ، به خصوص آن چیزهایی که فکر می کنید بخشی از شرایط هستند-
مواضع - به عنوان مثال ، شما با رئیس خود همراه نمی شوید و برای شما کاملاً واضح است
زیرا شما برای یک حرکت تند و تیز کار می کنید - این کار را در اینجا انجام می دهید. بلیک واضح است که این چیزی است که او حمل می کند

محصول شرایط است. به عنوان مثال ، اگر در اینجا شرایطی وجود داشته باشد ، زیرا
افراد مشاهده می کنند - که به نظر می رسد محصول این شرایط است. جبهه
شما در مورد حضور در انجمن به هر شکلی که هستید صحبت کردید. بیرون چیست

به خودتان اجازه دهید مثل شما در آن قسمت های انجمن که خارج از انجمن هستند ، باشید.
تکالیف تکالیف در طول استراحت ، و غیره. اگر این روحیه شما در حال حاضر است ، سعی نکنید
آن را تغییر دهید شما آن را آنجا می خواهید زیرا اگر در آنجا نباشد ، به ویژه با آن برخورد نمی شود
آن چیزهایی که فکر می کنید بخشی از شرایط هستند: آن را به اینجا بیاورید. بیشتر کاری که انجام می دهید
در چهار روز آینده در خارج از انجمن قرار است در این بخش قرار بگیرد. اگر کاری انجام دهید
برای جلوگیری از این امر ، پس یک بار دیگر با موفقیت از آن جلوگیری کردید. ببینید ، بسیاری از این موارد وجود دارد

دوست ندارم شما اکنون در آنجا با مجموعه ای از ارزیابی ها و نتیجه گیری ها در آنجا نشسته اید. ما این کار را بسیار انجام داده ایم. حتی می توانم به شما بگویم که ارزیابی ها و نتیجه گیری های شما چیست. یک شرکت کننده پرسید که آیا بر اساس همه اینها ، او باید مسائل و نگرانی های خاص خود را حفظ کند

ما از سال 1971 این کار را انجام داده ایم و در پایان سال 1984 بود که ما چهار نفر را بدست آوردیم
فرآیند سال توسعه انجمن ، و ما از سال 1985 در این مجمع خارج شده ایم
این کشور و در بسیاری از کشورهای دیگر در سراسر جهان. در این مرحله ، مردی به نام جیک برخاست تا از هدف جلسه عصر شکایت کند ،
که شرکت کنندگان برای دعوت از میهمانان تشویق شده بودند. جیک
آیا این بیشتر برای Werner Erhard و همکارانش نیست که اعضای بیشتری را آزار دهند؟ درز
شما می دانید که شما یک شلوغی هستید که منتظر وقوع آن هستید ، درست است؟ جیک
من گفتم احساس می کنم که تحت فشار قرار می گیرم. درز
من گفتم شما یک پسر هستید که منتظر اتفاق می افتد. جیک
من فکر نمی کنم که شلوغ شوم. درز
من گفتم شما یک پسر هستید که منتظر اتفاق می افتد. جیک
من آن را نمی بینم. ارهارد از صحنه پایین آمد و روی لبه سکو در نزدیکی او نشست. دوزین
در ابتدا ، معرفی اصطلاحی مهم است
در کار مارتین هایدگر ، و به همین دلیل شروع به پیشرفت خواهد کرد
تقریباً بلافاصله Dasein کلمه هایدگر برای وجود انسان است ،
و یکی از معدود اصطلاحات در نسخه های انگلیسی نوشتار اوست
این به طور مداوم از آلمانی ترجمه نشده است. در
واقعیت ، فرهنگ لغت در سال 2014 ، منتشر شده توسط
انتشارات دانشگاه پرینستون ، این کلمه را "الگوی" می نامد
غیرقابل ترجمه ، "و شش صفحه دو ستونی را به یک اختصاص می دهد
تلاش برای توضیح آن (آدام گوپنیک ، "کلمه جادوی" ، نیویورکر ، 26 مه 2014 ، 37). البته مشکلی در ترجمه این اصطلاح این اصطلاح است
در مهمترین کار هایدگر ، وجود و زمان ، مهم است.
که در آن او الگوی هستی شناختی خود را از انسانها ارائه می دهد. عناصر خاص این مدل در ادامه مورد بحث قرار خواهد گرفت
جزئیات را که ادامه می دهیم در حال حاضر ، کافی است توجه داشته باشید که Dasein
از این صحبت می شود که گویی این اصطلاح یک فرد را نشان می دهد. اما از آن زمان
این نشانگر وجود آن فرد است ، در عین حال اشاره دارد
به طور گسترده تر به موجودی جمعی از انسانها. erhard (ادامه)

این به هر حال به عنوان یک تعارف منظور شده بود. من می خواهم فرصتی برای انجام این کار برای شما داشته باشم

بله ، من آن را کردم. اولین صبح این انجمن به عنوان گفتگو با این گروه ادامه یافت زیرا Erhard به آن پاسخ داد
سوالات شرکت کنندگان یک زن ابراز نگرانی کرد که مطالب "بالای سر او" می رود.

بیشتر آنچه من می گویم برای سر شما طراحی نشده است. درک مشکل در زندگی نیست. اگر
شما یک دوره چهار روزه را در مورد نحوه تنیس بازیگر گذراندید و دوره را به عنوان یک تنیس عالی ترک کردید
بازیکن بدون درک یک کلمه از آن ، تفاوت شما یک تنیس عالی خواهد بود
بازیکن. ما به شما قول درک نمی کنیم. شما خوشحال می شوید که درک کنید. من این را دوست دارم
چیزها ، بنابراین من از درک آن لذت می برم. این یک عجیب در من است. ما این کار را انجام می دهیم تا آزادی وجود داشته باشد
بودن اگر درک کنید ، این جایزه مشاعره است. شما از اینجا با
آزادی این که وقتی در اینجا قدم می زنید ، نداشتید ، پس از آن چیزی برای خود دریافت کردید
پول صحبت در اینجا به گونه ای طراحی شده است که آزادی را ایجاد می کند ... شما نمی فهمید چه چیزی
یعنی آنچه من را به من علاقه دارد آزادی بودن است. قبل از این نیز به آن علاقه مند خواهید شد
تمام شده است من قبلاً انجمن را انجام داده ام ، بنابراین می دانم که این کار انجام شده است. یک زن اظهار داشت که او همیشه عصبی بوده است. erhard (به گروه)
چند نفر در اینجا همیشه عصبی هستند؟ (بیشترین دست خود را بالا می برند)
شما می فهمید که چیزهایی که با شما اتفاق می افتد با همه ادامه می یابد؟ شما
مثل طوفان باران. شما باید دریافت کنید که هیچ چیز شخصی در مورد طوفان باران وجود ندارد - یعنی ،
که آن را در حال آبشارهای کوچک است. شما فکر می کنید که طوفان باران نگران زندگی روی زمین است. شما
فکر کنید که باران می بارد به طوری که ... باران می بارد. درست است که زندگی با باران پایدار است ، اما این است
درست نیست که باران به ترتیب باران می بارد. سال (ایستاده ، دریافت میکروفون)
شما فقط معناشناسی را استدلال می کنید. درز
نه ، این معنایی نیست. یا پاسخ دیگر به آن این است ، بله این معناشناسی است ، اما همه چیز دیگر نیز چنین است
در جهان دو پایان نامه
اولین پایان نامه این کتاب ، که مستقیماً مورد بررسی قرار می گیرد
متن ، این است که کار ورنر ارهارد در مهم تراز شده است
راه هایی با تفکر مارتین هایدگر. هدف ما این است که
این تراز را از طریق تجزیه و تحلیل مقایسه ای از کار آنها نشان دهید ،
تحلیلی که نه تنها تفکر هر دو مرد را روشن می کند ، بلکه
همچنین ماهیت نگرانی اصلی آنها را روشن می کند. پایان نامه دوم ، از نظر اهمیت با اولی ، نمی تواند
مستقیماً در متن خطاب شود. ما آن را با
مدت بودن ، از آنجا که مگر اینکه آن را نشان دهیم ، نمی توانیم در مورد آن صحبت کنیم -
هایدگر می گوید: "نمی توان بدون مقصر بودن در ملاء عام قرار گرفت"
(جغد 29). اما این اصطلاح صرفاً به عنوان یک مکان فروش ، از آن زمان خدمت می کند
آنچه نشان می دهد را نمی توان در ما فکر کرد ، یا حتی در مورد آن فکر کرد

من معتقدم که وقتی باران می بارد ، باران می بارد تا زندگی را حفظ کند. درز
خوب ، بگذارید آنجا بمانیم. شخص دیگری در آن بالگرد با سال؟ اگر هستید بایستید. اگر در آن بایستید

اگر ایستاده اید و به صورت نظم هستید ، در مشارکت خود دخالت می کنید
انجمن این افرادی که ایستاده اند احمق نیستند. آنها پای خود را به سمت
جایی که در جایی قرار دارد. این اتفاق برای همه شما بارها در طول انجمن رخ خواهد داد. (به سال ، نشانگر صندلی کارگردان روی سکو)
آیا پاهای آنجا برای نگه داشتن صندلی است؟ ما می دانیم که پاها صندلی را نگه می دارند. برای پاها ،
آیا در سفارش وجود دارد؟ آیا پاها به ترتیب هستند؟ (مکث)
این خیلی سخت است ... بگذارید چیزی متفاوت را امتحان کنم. آیا دیوار ایستاده است تا نگه دارد
سقف بالا؟ ساله
بله ، به نظر من درز

این اندام عمدی در طوفان باران کجاست؟ ساله
معنویت جهان. erhard (به گروه)
او فقط به من گفت كه پایش كجا به آن میخ زده است. او چیزی است که او معتقد است بنابراین نمی تواند
به آن فکر کنید (به سال)
شما فکر می کنید در طوفان باران یک عمد وجود دارد. شما گفتید که این اعتقاد شماست که موضوع بوده است
به نوعی با روح حمله کرد. آیا به منظور تولید fl oods باران می بارد؟ روش معمول مفهوم سازی. "آزادی" و یک مفهومی فکر کنید
BARRAGE برانگیخته می شود. فکر کنید "بودن" و منابع ذهن اندک است. پایان نامه دوم ما ، از آنجا که در مفاهیم ضبط می شود ،
فقط می توان به آن اشاره کرد. همیشه به عنوان یک پس زمینه وجود دارد ،
در حوزه زبانی که همیشه ناگفته مانده است. ناگفته ، این زمینه ناشناخته است که راه ما را شکل می دهد
هر چیز دیگری را درک کنید ناگفته ، به عنوان موجود است
پیشینه تحول در گفتگوی انجمن ؛
ناگفته ، به طور مداوم در نوشتن هایدگر و در
سخنرانی های او پایان نامه دوم ما ، این دامنه ناگفته است
زبان ، به طور رسمی به عنوان قلمرو هستی شناختی گفته می شود. در این کتاب ، برای نشان دادن آنچه ورنر ارهارد و مارتین
هایدگر در کار خود انجام می دهند ، از نویسندگان فراخوانده می شوند
گفتن - اشاره به - پویایی مشترک ناگفته در مرکز
از آن کار به ناچار ، یک عنصر رمز و راز در این مورد شرکت می کند
موضوع ؛ اما هیچ چیز در اینجا شیطانی یا قوس دار نیست. در حالی که هستی شناختی
ارتباطات روزمره ما خواسته های جدی می کند
درک ، کار Erhard یک آموزش عملی است
روش شناسی ، نشان می دهد که آموزش فراتر از آن صرفاً
معرفت شناختی یک امکان در دنیای واقعی است. نویسندگان قصد دارند پایان نامه دوم ما باشد
با ادامه این کار در پس زمینه ارتباط برقرار کردیم
کتاب ، خواننده را با اشاره به ماهیت خود در هنگام ظهور در آن قرار دهید
انجمن یکی از جنبه های این ارتباط پس زمینه این است که
اصطلاحات یا مفاهیم ناآشنا ممکن است به طور کامل در
نقطه اول ظاهر آنها. در عوض ، آنها متمایز خواهند شد
به تدریج همانطور که ظاهر می شوند و در متن ظاهر می شوند. یک تعریف
محدودیت های مفهومی را مشخص می کند. تمایز فضایی برای
فکر کردن و بازیگری ، و هر بار فضا گسترش می یابد
تمایز روبرو می شود. بنابراین ، هدف تحقیق است
هرگز پاسخی نداشته باشید ، اما باز کردن سوالی که از آن استفاده می شود
برای تجربه جهان. ما خواننده را دعوت می کنیم تا
آزادی که این پیشینه از سوال پذیری می دهد: در بازی در
سوال ، شما نیازی به جواب درست ندارید. ■

بنابراین اندام عمدی وقتی تولید می کند کار نمی کند؟ ساله
نه ، این فقط اتفاق می افتد. درز
اما این فقط اتفاق نمی افتد که وقتی باران باران پایدار می شود؟ به یاد داشته باشید ، سال ، هیچ سؤال وجود ندارد
بین شما و من که آب زندگی را حفظ می کند. سوال این است: آیا باران به صورت باران می بارد؟ یا آیا این فقط اتفاق می افتد ، و به هر حال ، زندگی را حفظ می کند؟ در این مرحله به نظر می رسید که سال نقطه ارهارد را می بیند و نشست. erhard (به سال)
خوب اکنون ، فقط چیزی شخصی بین من و من. من این کار را خیلی انجام داده ام برخی وجود دارد-
چیزی که من در این گفتگو از شما قدردانی کردم. شما در مکالمه باز بودید. (به گروه)
هیچ کس نمی خواهد با من در اینجا پیروز شود. زیرا این بازی من است ، و فقط یک آسفالت است
سعی می کنم در بازی یک پسر دیگر برنده شوید. من و شما بحث و گفتگو داشتیم که در آنجا چیزی گرفتیم
حرف
با هم باران غیر شخصی است. ما در مورد مرتبه بالاتر چیزها صحبت نمی کردیم. من نمی خواهم
هرکسی که هر چیزی را که می گویم باور کند. و من علاقه ای به حفظ هر چیزی که شما باور دارید نیست. بلیک (یادآوری آنچه در این لحظه در گفتگو اتفاق افتاده بود)
من می دانم که سکانس وجود دارد و آن را از دست دادم. من اشاره کردم که عصبی هستم ، که
آن را دوست نداریم ، و بعد ما در مورد باران صحبت می کردیم. erhard (به گروه)
او فقط نشان داد که نمی داند ، روشن است که او نمی داند. این تفاوت دارد که
ذوب شده این یکی از مواردی است که باید بدست آورد. بین دانستن اینکه شما این کار را نمی کنید ، تفاوت زیادی وجود دارد
درک کنید ، دانستن اینکه شما چیزی را دنبال نکرده اید. دانستن چیزی معنی ندارد
و گیج بودن بسیار متفاوت است. شما عصبی بودن اختراع نکردید. حتی اگر باران باشد
غیر شخصی ، شما شخصاً خیس می شوید. همین مسئله برای عصبی بودن نیز پیش می رود. عصبی بودن
بخشی از انسان بودن است. انسان بودن متعلق به شما نیست. شما به آن تعلق دارید شما اختراع نکردید
انسان بودن شما برای مهمانی دیر بودید. انسان بودن همیشه روشی برای این است که
وارد شدی این مانند طوفان باران است ، و این درست است که شما شخصاً خیس شده اید. شما یک انسان هستید
گفتگوی هستی شناختی
جنبه قابل توجهی از روش Erhard ، که دوباره ظاهر می شود
و دوباره در طول انجمن ، پایداری او در فشار دادن است
هرگونه تعامل یا هر موضوع بحث از طریق تکمیل. کامل ، برای Erhard ، به معنای ساده تمام نیست ، بلکه بیشتر است
کل ، و فاقد هیچ یک از قسمت های اساسی آن نیست. بارها و بارها ، بعد از
او در یک نقطه خاص با یک فرد درگیر شده است
درخواست می کند که دیگران در اتاق که در آن نقطه مشخص نیستند
بایستید و با هر یک از شرکت کنندگان به صورت جداگانه کار کنید تا همه
آنها آن را برای خودشان "بدست آورده اند". erhard اغلب از این اصطلاح استفاده می کند
"صاف" به همان معنی ، مانند "بیایید قبلاً آن را یک مسطح کنیم
ما حرکت می کنیم. " برای به دست آوردن چیزی مسطح ، در گفتگوی هستی شناختی ،
به این معنی است که مورد مورد نظر فراتر از یک مورد منتقل شده است
سطح مفهومی درک ، و متمایز شده است
به عنوان یک امکان هستی شناختی ، حداقل به معنای اولیه. در
با ادامه انجمن ، تمایز همچنان از بین می رود ،
در نهایت تبدیل شدن به یک پاکسازی برای وجود ؛ اما اولین قدم در آن
فرایند این است که مفهوم را صاف کنید ، به گونه ای که امکان هستی شناختی آن است
می توان شنید البته ، "گرفتن آن" و "کامل بودن" ممکن است باشد
به عنوان "تسلیم شدن در دیدگاه ارهارد" بخوانید. درز
به نظر می رسید که خودش از این تفسیر پشتیبانی می کند و به یک انجمن می گوید
شرکت کننده بلیک ، "هیچ کس نمی خواهد با من در اینجا پیروز شود. زیرا این بازی من است ، و فقط یک آسفالت سعی می کند در آن پیروز شود
بازی پسر دیگری. " در طول یک جلسه Debriefing با انجمن
رهبران در مورد نقش خود در گفتگو ، دوباره ارجارد را ارجاع داد
به روند آگونیستی: "شما باید برخی از آنها را داشته باشید
او گفت: "
بله ، شما می خواهید از این مزیت استفاده کنید ، این بخشی از بازی است. "

بودن ، اما شما انسان را تشکیل ندادید. شما عصبی بودن اختراع نکردید. شما اختراع نکردید
داشتن مانعی برای بیان خود. این متعلق به شما نیست. این مال شماست این در
همیشه موجود در انسان است. متعلق به شما نیست ؛ شما به آن تعلق دارید (به زور)
صاحب شما است! شما آن را ندارید. عصبی بودن صاحب زندگی شما است. شما عصبی نیستید. در
استعاره این است که هیچ چیز شخصی در مورد طوفان باران وجود ندارد. این فقط باران می بارد ، و من ، شما ، شخصاً
خیس شوید اما طوفان باران باران نمی بارد تا مرا خیس کند. عصبی بودن همیشه است
آنجا در وجود انسان بودن است. و من و شما به آن طوفان باران می رویم و خیس می شویم ... در انجمن ، شما این قدرت را می گیرید که در مورد شیوه بودن خود چیزی بگویید. در حال حاضر
فقط می توانید در مورد آن گزارش دهید. اما شما نمی توانید بگویید "من عصبی نیستم" و این تفاوت را ایجاد می کند. بعد از انجمن قادر خواهید بود. جنجال
من آنقدر عصبی نیستم که وقتی برای اولین بار ایستادم. من اینجا هستم تا یک تغییر ایجاد کنم ، یک اشغال جدید پیدا کنم-
برای بلند شدن در مقابل مردم. آنچه نیاز دارد بلند شدن است. درز
لزوماً جنجال
خوب ، من نمی دانم. درز
درست است و من می دانم جنجال
به همین دلیل من از شما می پرسم. درز
من می خواهم آن را حل و فصل کنم زیرا شما می خواهید آن انواع احمقانه را بگویید: چه
شما باید انجام دهید و کاری که لازم نیست برای این کار انجام دهید. و جواب این است که شما نمی کنید
می دانید بنابراین من به شما می گویم: کاری که شما باید انجام دهید این است که کاری که انجام می دهید. بنابراین شما همیشه می دانید چه چیزی
شما باید انجام دهید زیرا آنچه را که انجام می دهید انجام می دهید. برای انجام کاری که انجام نمی دهید:
این بد است اگر کاری را انجام دهید که انجام می دهید. یکی از کارهایی که شما انجام می دهید فکر کردن است-
شما باید بایستید. این برای شما فکر می کنید. شما می خواهید بدانید که چرا فکر می کنم این است
برای اینکه او فکر کند؟ زیرا این همان چیزی است که او فکر می کند. جنجال
درست است در بعضی از مواقع شما هر آنچه را که در این راه بود شکستید و اکنون بالا هستید
آنجا کاری را انجام می دهید که انجام می دهید. بازی در تالار گفتگو ، برانگیختن حضور است
از بودن ، و حریف رهبر انجمن راه بودن است
که ما در عصر تکنولوژیکی به دنیا آمده ایم (راه
ما را زخمی کردیم). واضح است ، جهت خاصی وجود دارد که
اگر هدف آن باشد باید در گفتگوی انجمن حفظ شود
برای دستیابی حفظ این جهت در صورت
مقاومت شرکت کنندگان ممکن است برای روزمره ظاهر شود
درک ، همانطور که از نیاز به رهبر انجمن انگیزه دارد
بخشی برای برنده شدن در بازی ، به طوری که دیدگاه انجمن نشان داده شده است
واقعی بودن با این حال ، در انجمن پذیرفته شده است
مسئولیت رهبر انجمن حفظ هستی شناختی است
شخصیت مکالمه. ارهارد گفت: "کار من" است
گفتگو را مدیریت کنید. " این مدیریت موضوع نیست
برنده شدن ، اما از دیدگاه. در یک گفتگوی اخیر
با نویسندگان ، Erhard اینگونه گفت: "من از این روش استفاده کردم
صحبت برای مقابله با افرادی که برای مقاومت در برابر مقاومت هستند ،
به جای اینکه در یک گفتگو کار کنید. "
هرگونه بحث در مورد گفتگو به عنوان آموزش همیشه باید در نظر بگیرد
مسئله متقابل ، و این به خصوص ظریف است وقتی
هدف گفتگو ، حفظ وجود است. رهبران انجمن "
رتبه در گفتگوی انجمن با توانایی آنها در گوش دادن داده می شود
مکالمه از یک دیدگاه خاص. همانطور که ارهارد گفت
رهبران انجمن ، "شما باید بدانید که یک گفتگوی معتبر است
رفتن به ایجاد وضوح. شما همچنین باید تماشا کنید که دریافت نمی کنید
قلاب آنچه شما [شما] قلاب می کند وقتی کسی چیزی را می گوید
شما فکر می کنید شما را به ضرر می اندازد. " قلاب دار شدن ، برای یک انجمن
رهبر ، به معنای جلب استدلال یا ارتباطی با آن است
داستانهای شرکت کنندگان در مورد زندگی آنها ، نه حفظ
دیدگاه دگرگون شده توسط هستی شناختی انجمن
تمایزات این کار رهبر تالار گفتمان است که قلاب نشود. این تعادل بین متقابل و هدایت در
گفتگوی هستی شناختی یک موضوع مهم است. بدیهی است ، وجود دارد
فشار به چنین گفتگو - حرکت مکالمه در
جهت قصد هستی شناختی آن. در گفتگوی خود با
محقق ژاپنی در راه زبان ، هایدگر اشاره می کند
به ماهیت گفتگوی واقعی وقتی او اظهار داشت که "ما ممکن است
