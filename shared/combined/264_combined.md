SPEAKING BEING
Erhard left the room at this point. Wes was on the platform, Kipp down among the group.
WES
You sure about that? Because you and your roommate discuss it a lot, right?
PATSY
Only at work.
(laughter)
WES
I see, so it keeps you from working. I can understand it.
PATSY
While I’m here being human, I want it to be good for me. I want to like what I’m doing.
Wes produced a clipping from a South Korean newspaper.
WES (referring to the newspaper clipping)
This is your life. This is how your life could be with a little more signifi cance. Here’s the title:
“Wife is late with the lunch, kills herself.”
He read aloud the account, which concerned a woman who had forgotten that daylight savings time
was being instituted for the fi rst time. As a result, she had prepared her husband’s lunch late. She
then killed herself.
WES
You think she was dealing with some kind of meaning there?
PATSY
No, not a meaning that I know or recognize, or acknowledge.
(laughter)
WES
That’s meaning. A person kills herself because she served lunch an hour late. That’s the
possibility of a human being’s commitment to having things be signifi cant. You have an analogy
to that in your life. Really. No kidding.
Erhard had re-entered the room.
ERHARD
Did you not get that your story, read by a person in a diff erent culture, would sound like that
story sounded to you?
Forum Day Three: Session Three 251
PATSY
Yes.
ERHARD
Serving lunch late to your husband is serving lunch late to your husband. That’s all it is. And
that woman hung herself. Can you see that you hung yourself? Isn’t it silly to hang yourself
because someone got a divorce? It’s a joke, and you guys don’t get the joke. Life is a joke. Are
you getting that?
PATSY (grimly)
Yes. Very clear.
ERHARD
Yes, you are getting that. And you’re having the appropriate response to it at the moment. And
you’re not all the way through it yet. Good.
(applause)
She sat. A participant named Beverly stood.
BEVERLY
I want to know, “now what?” I’m looking for a new possibility, a new language so I can relate
to people, to work for both of... And now I’m hearing that I’ve been transformed, and...
ERHARD
And you don’t like it. You don’t like “transformed.”
BEVERLY
No, because they have to be transformed again. Go to a new level.
ERHARD
There are no levels. This is all there is.
BEVERLY
As far as each individual is concerned there are levels.
ERHARD
Who told you that? Did you speak to the Pope personally? This is a product of your infi nite
wisdom?
BEVERLY
People diff er from person to person.
252
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
So what? Each rock is diff erent from each other. So what? There’s some mythology going on
here with this levels stuff . Tell me about levels.
BEVERLY
I don’t know about levels. I’m just hearing that people are transformed.
ERHARD
Who?
BEVERLY
Friends and those that are here...
ERHARD
Do you know what it is to be transformed?
BEVERLY
No.
ERHARD
What it is to be transformed is to know that life is empty and meaningless—and I don’t mean
know like hear and understand, I mean know like “be.” When you are that life is empty and
meaningless, and you’re not making anything out of that, and you’re not doing anything with
it, and it’s not a justifi cation, and it’s not an explanation, and there’s no prescription, and
it doesn’t give you a prescription, then you’re transformed. When you are that life is empty
and meaningless, and when that doesn’t give you anything—in other words, when you are
that life is empty and meaningless and that doesn’t give you a prescription for living, and it
doesn’t explain everything, it’ll give you light. It’ll light up everything. In that moment I got
it, when I got that everything was in order to make it, the universe lit up. I didn’t need to
know anything. I didn’t need to know that there was a fl oor down there holding me up. It was
just there. So what it is to be transformed is to be that life is empty and meaningless, and to be
that it’s empty and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless: To be that life is not going
to work out. And you are not someday going to have a relationship into which you put your
heart and soul.
BEVERLY
I want life to be easy.
ERHARD
Life is not going to be easier. You’re not going to fi nd an answer. It’s going to be just like it is.
And you can bank on that. Life’s been around for a long time. It’s always only been like it is.
And tomorrow it’s going to be like it is tomorrow. But you’re not living there. You live for it to be
easy, which means you haven’t lived yet.
When you are that life is empty and mean-
ingless, and you’re not making anything out
of that, and you’re not doing anything with
it, and it’s not a justification, and it’s not an
explanation, and there’s no prescription, and
it doesn’t give you a prescription, then you’re
transformed.

Forum Day Three: Session Three 253
BEVERLY
I’m at one point today and I’ll be at another point tomorrow.
ERHARD
And another point the day after that. And after that you’ll be in another point. On and on until
there are no more points and they’ll throw dirt in your face.
BEVERLY
I want to make it easier for me to get to points faster.
ERHARD
No. You won’t get there any faster.
BEVERLY
Then where am I going?
ERHARD
Nowhere. There’s nowhere to go. You already got there.
(loudly)
There’s no place to go! You already got there! You don’t like it now that you’re there? That is
too fucking bad.
BEVERLY
I think there’s another way of looking at it.
(laughter)
ERHARD
Beverly, there are always other ways of looking at it and all of them are unenlightened.
BEVERLY
Why did I pay $625?
ERHARD
You paid $625 to be that life is empty and meaningless, and that it’s meaningless that life is
empty and meaningless. You paid $625 to fi nd out that life isn’t going to be diff erent. Like it’s
always been: it is like it is. You don’t live life like it is what it is. You live life like “it’s going to
be diff erent.” And that makes you an asshole. It’s not a bad thing to be, just a thing to be, like
a fart. All the stuff  we did... everything we’ve done up to now was to get to the point where we
could have this discussion. I told you up front that we were going to keep moving back until we
got to zero. Empty and meaningless is as zero as you can get.
254
SPEAKING BEING
BEVERLY
And so now we’re going to progress somewhere?
(laughter)
ERHARD
No no. See, if we progress somewhere then we’d have to get back to zero again.
BEVERLY
And so we’re going in a circle to get back to zero.
ERHARD
No, we’re going to be at zero.
BEVERLY
And then we’ll be happy.
ERHARD
I don’t know. But I am certain that you will if you are. You’ll never be happy waiting for it to
turn out. You’re never going to be happy trying to get it to move faster. Listen carefully. You’re
never going to be happy waiting for the right tool, or the right answer with which to be related.
If you’re going to be related, you’re going to have to be related like this. Just like this. This is not
a practice session for the real relationship. This is the real relationship. That’s what you want to
get. This is it. It’s not going to work out because it has already worked out. This is what you got
to be related in and this is all you’re ever going to have. You’re always only going to have what
you got. You’re never gonna have what you don’t got and are waiting for. If you get that, that
should give you a very powerful sense of freedom. And take a great big burden there and let you
be with the relationship you already have.
Erhard had been sitting on the platform edge, talking very directly to Beverly, who stood about seven
rows back. He was very focused and deliberate throughout the exchange.
ERHARD
Is that a little clearer?
BEVERLY
Yes.
(applause)
RICHARD
Last night someone I was staying with in the room told me that I snored. I stayed up late last
night, trying to make sure that... I told them I wouldn’t snore and I stayed up most of the night
to make sure I wouldn’t snore. So it’s not quite a divorce and not quite a divorcee’s roommate. I
Forum Day Three: Session Three 255
got that because I wrote my letter yesterday before I went to bed. And I didn’t have to wake up
to get there. If someone asked me what I would give up, if I snored, I could give up the idea if I
could stop myself from snoring.
KIPP
You only snore if you snore.
RICHARD
Well, there’s more to the story. I only snore in hotels.
KIPP
Got it.
RICHARD
I learned to snore in hotels. I lived in them for a year and a half.
KIPP
Clear.
ERHARD
What there is to get out of Richard’s share is that life is made up of trying to be. It’s made up of
trying not to be, and of trying to be. Is there any being in trying not to be or trying to be?
(Richard sits down and another participant stands)
MOLLY (in tears)
I came to The Forum on a mission from God to save WE & A. It’s actually not a joke. I mean: it
is a joke on me... What I found out is that my racket is being abandoned. And I found out that I
play my racket with God.
ERHARD
I don’t talk about God a lot, because I don’t have a license to talk about God. You didn’t pay me
to talk about God, so if somebody brings it up, I do what I can to avoid it, and if I can’t avoid
it, I say as little as I can. I don’t like talking to you about God because God’s a racket for you
and that’s disgusting. You need to listen to what Molly is saying because she knows both sides
of the coin...now. So we’re not going to have a lot of discussions about this. We’ll have this
discussion with Molly for everybody else. Go on.
MOLLY
I told my husband that when I was meditating that God told me to take The Forum, and he
said, “so how are you going to get in this time, ’cause they rejected you last time.” I said I
would play it their way. On the form I wrote what was so, but not the real so. It was the “how
to get in” so.
256
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
And the other “so” was in order to something else.
MOLLY
Well the whole thing was an in-order-to.
ERHARD
Yeah, good. Do you have any idea how sacrilegious that is? God in-order-to.
MOLLY
Every time someone called me from The Forum I ripped them off , because I was this holy
person. I wasn’t there for them, because I was on a religious path. I faked it. When I got to The
Forum, I looked around to check out how tough a job it would be for God. And what I found
out was, that when I was four years old I could remember back, and I did this through the
process of completing with my parents.
(addressing Erhard)
I saw that I could trust you. And you said that the bonus points came with completing with
your parents. I saw that I’d never done that. I tried everything. I threw everything out. I saw that
I had paid $625... when you said that I had paid for it, and that if I was going to give it back for
free that I was a sucker... Whatever I heard that got me here was for me. I saw that I came to
The Forum to get The Forum. And you have to save your own soul.
(laughter and applause)
The room became very still as Molly spoke. Erhard sat on the platform in front of her, with Kipp and
Wes seated nearby.
MOLLY (continuing to cry)
I called my parents. I didn’t know how to do it. I was just standing there. They were both social
workers, retired. I didn’t know how to say this. And what I felt was that all they’d ever done for
me is love me. That was it. No matter what, it was love. It was like Eden. Somehow I was back
in Eden. Everything was everything. They asked what was wrong. I said there was nothing to
worry about. I told them I loved them and knew they loved me. “I’ve been hurt by all this stuff
that happened, but I get that everything you’ve done was done out of love.” And they started
telling me their stories, and doing their social worker stuff . What I got is that I didn’t know
much about them.
ERHARD
People love all that process stuff . That’s why they’re off ended that The Forum is four days and
one night. It’s not long enough. There’s not enough agony to it. When you can be with the story,
you don’t get stuck with it. And if you can’t be with the story, they’re going to keep telling it
over and over and over and over because you can’t be with it.
Forum Day Three: Session Three 257
MOLLY
And then we got to the deeper part of the story. My father told me how much I didn’t
appreciate what he gave me, and my mother said that I abandoned them when I went to
college...
ERHARD
Hold on, I want everyone to get this.
(loudly)
They’ve got a big fucking story too! They got their story. Can you imagine the story my
mother’s got? My mother doesn’t have any story. She could have a story. So. You were noticing
that they have a story.
MOLLY
I’ve been terrifi ed all my life of anger. And I would do anything I can to avoid anger. I do that
with my husband. Standing on this ledge on the phone with them. The anger would pull me
down to the valley. I would become comatose.
ERHARD
Right, you became comatose once to survive being with your parents.
MOLLY
I was comatose.
ERHARD
When you are that it’s empty and meaningless and it’s empty and meaningless that it’s empty
and meaningless, and you can be with another’s story no matter what it is, you’re fearless.
Without fear you don’t have need for courage.
MOLLY
My father’s anger didn’t frighten me for a change. I loved him.
ERHARD
It’s not that you like or endorse his being angry. He’s angry, that’s all. And when you can be
with his anger it disappears. When you got to try to do something to get him from being angry,
or get him to stop being angry, or some other ploy, the anger persists no matter how good the
ploy is. I know this because I talk to your kids. They forgive but they don’t forget, until you can
be with whatever it is that they’re remembering.
MOLLY
I didn’t have to prove anything.
ERHARD
Because it’s horseshit. What is this more or less love, to start with? “You either love me or you don’t”.
258
SPEAKING BEING
MOLLY
My mother shifted. She talked about how she’d made a lot of mistakes. And how her parents
were diff erent. They weren’t taught how to be with their kids.
ERHARD
You made mistakes raising your children means you made mistakes raising your children, it
doesn’t mean “bad mother,” even though that’s what you got it to mean.
MOLLY
And then she said: “How can we get from here to there?”
ERHARD
Nobody wants to be there. They want to get there. But you can’t get there. You can only be there.
That’s the joke. Nothing is going to make you happy. Nothing. Nothing is going to make you
happy. That happens to be literally true, by the way, but never mind that. You’re going to spend
the rest of your life trying to get what is going to make you happy, except that nothing’s going
to get you happy. You’ve gotta be happy, you can’t get happy. Getting is anathema to happiness.
The pursuit of happiness is the single most eff ective barrier to happiness. Nothing is more
certain to deprive you of happiness than the pursuit of happiness. This is another form of that
answer that there is no answer.
MOLLY
I said to my parents: “Didn’t something shift? We’re here now.” And they laughed. And it was
tender.
ERHARD
That’s really living—that laugh. Is there anything more to complete about this?
MOLLY
After the phone call to my parents, talking to my husband, I remembered an incident when
I was four years old. I was jumping on the couch and I hit the window and cracked open my
forehead. 18 stitches. I was given a washcloth and there was all this blood. We went to the
hospital. In the operating room, all I could see was a huge light, and this disembodied doctor’s
voice told my mother to leave. She left. She went away and left me there. My whole life has been
about that. I’ve been stuck with that abandonment all my life.
ERHARD
Yeah, and stuck with that bright light.
(laughter)
You can’t say anything more important than “that’s what my life has been about ever since.”
That gets you to the source of your whole life. That gets you to zero. All the way back, at
nothing.
Nothing is going to make you happy. Nothing.
Nothing is going to make you happy. That hap-
pens to be literally true, by the way, but never
mind that.
“
Forum Day Three: Session Three 259
MOLLY
What I got about my relationship with God? Well, my racket is that everyone abandoned me,
including God. You have to buy love. And I was told you had to serve God to make God happy
so he’d love you.
ERHARD (to the group)
Somehow, way back in history when all this God stuff  got started, God got turned into a story. I
invite you to consider the possibility that the story somehow served the transmission process in
those primitive times. This notion rings very hollow for me. Nevertheless, for people like you
and me to be living those stories is disgusting and sacrilegious. To reduce an infi nite possibility
into some crap story... That’s the end of my sermon.
MOLLY
I’ve spent a lot of years serving.
ERHARD
The only time serving is nurturing is when you’re serving to serve, not serving in-order-to.
MOLLY
What I saw was that everybody was getting served except me, and I was getting exhausted.
ERHARD
I don’t know that being stuck with God is a good thing. Free to might be a more appropriate
relationship to God than have to.
(to Molly)
But that’s your business. My business is dog shit.
MOLLY
Apparently mine is too.
(laughter)
So when I saw that I had taken on this job to make God happy...
ERHARD (laughing)
Isn’t that ridiculous? This is a very good discussion. Go ahead.
MOLLY
And when I saw how ridiculous it was and how tired I was getting...
ERHARD
I got tired making God happy. It’s a new book. Look, you understand that Molly’s probably
produced more freedom in people’s relationship with God in the last fi fteen minutes than she
has in her whole life? She’s giving some room to be by sharing. She did it by sharing herself,
not her fucking platitudes, not her beliefs.
God
Here, Erhard is assuring that the “trap” that The Forum sets for
participants—the trap of the current paradigm, in which Forum
participants must find themselves hopelessly ensnared before
they can access the liberation of transformation—is experienced
as inescapable. Even God, for many still the most sacred of values,
must finally fall victim to the demands of standing-reserve. As
perceived through the metaphysical-technological lens of Western
thought, God is inevitably burdened with the entailments of
that paradigm. First, “He” becomes an unattainable ideality (the
Creator who, in Heidegger’s view, is an extension of the Platonic
notion of ideal form); and, at the same time, “He” is placed in
standing-reserve, along with everything else in the technological
clearing, and thus can be loved and worshiped only in-order-to—
that is, for salvation, forgiveness, eternal reward, and so forth. ■
260
SPEAKING BEING
MOLLY
I saw that I wanted to end hunger to make God happy. And I saw that God was suffi  cient. I
mean, God was just doing fi ne.
(laughter and applause)
And it was a tremendous relief. I didn’t have to make God happy. I could do what I did just for
the joy of it.
ERHARD
Good.
WES
Got it. Congratulations.
Molly sat down.
WES
Here’s what I got from Molly: God’s happy. What’s your problem?
(laughter)
We’re going to dinner. That doesn’t change empty and meaningless. Let me point out the places
people are at at this point in The Forum. For some the possibility is very clear. Some don’t
know exactly what is happening. Some are very sure they’re not in tune with what’s happening.
Recognize places you are in.
ERHARD
He means possibility like an opening, like freedom, not like an answer... You want to get that
real clear in here, because I know you’ve been hearing possibility like an answer. We do not
mean possibility as an answer, but a clearing in which life can happen. You can’t dance with
answers. You dance with freedom. You can’t paint knowing how to paint, knowing the answers.
You’ve got to have an openness, room.
WES
So you’re in diff erent places with regard to the conversation. I invite you to go to dinner in a
group.
ERHARD (regarding the approaching dinner break)
You notice you’re a little less frenzied about dinner? Like dinner might be just dinner, rather
than a chance to get away.
WES
At dinner, have a conversation about where you are in The Forum. Not your opinions, ideas,
and notions: something about where you are and what you see in your life. Continue to stand
in this conversation. You don’t need to go anywhere. Let it unfold for you. With regard to your
Forum Day Three: Session Three 261
experience at the moment, some people at this point are high. Some people are angry. Some
people are sad. Some people are “What’s the big deal?”
Wes had those in each category raise their hands. On the video each time Wes asked for hands, very
few went up until the last one: “What’s the big deal?”
WES
It doesn’t mean anything. You can almost be assured that by the time dinner is over you’ll be in
a diff erent experience anyway. It doesn’t mean anything.
ERHARD
Who in here knew that it was empty and meaningless? For a long time knew it?
(several participants raise their hands)
You have it like an answer, which is diff erent from how we are saying it here. It’s not a solution
to a problem, so you smart-asses didn’t get it.
WES
Let yourself be where you are. The other assignment: see if you have any questions about the
seminar program.
ERHARD
Up till now we’ve talked about dog shit. Now we’re going to talk about the truth. The truth
about the truth is that it doesn’t mean anything. It’s just the truth. People do occasionally
stumble into the truth. Sometimes they fall over the truth. But they invariably suck the power
out of it, the truth-value out of it and turn it into an empty shell. And they do that by trying to
make the truth useful. The truth is useless. I mean that the truth does not justify anything. If
you stumble across the truth, or had a fl ash of insight, and you use it to explain something, if it
was true, it’s now not true, because you’ve taken the truth out of the context in which it exists,
which context is useless, and put it into a context in which it cannot exist as the truth, which is
“use.” The truth is useless. It gives no prescriptions. None. It’s never the basis for a rule, never
the basis for a prescription. The truth is useless. So anything you’re doing based on the truth is
based on bullshit. You don’t use the truth; the truth uses you. If you want to have a relationship
with the truth, be a place for the truth to go to work. Don’t try to use it, because when you try
to use it in any way, it loses its truth-value. If you want some evidence for that, look around the
world, and the places where you’ll fi nd the greatest destruction, the most evil—those things
were done in the name of the truth. Don’t fuck with the truth. Let it be. Let it use you. Let it be
and let it use you. Don’t try to use it. Because if you got lucky and you stumbled over the truth
and then tried to use it, you sucked all the truth-value that it had; all the power it had as the
truth is gone.*
If you stumble across the truth, or had a flash
of insight, and you use it to explain something,
if it was true, it’s now not true, because you’ve
taken the truth out of the context in which it
exists, which context is useless, and put it into
a context in which it cannot exist as the truth,
which is “use.”

SPEAKING BEING
The Forgetting of Being, Part Five of Eight: Physis
To gain insight into the elusive nature of transformation, we are tracing the history
of Being, as unearthed by Heidegger in his reading of the Pre-Socratic Greek
philosophers. When Heidegger speaks of the Pre-Socratics, he oft en says simply “the
Greeks”; however, as we will show, the level of insight achieved by these thinkers
was not likely shared by the hoi polloi, the Greek population as a whole.
One of the tasks required by Heidegger’s project was to distinguish the original
meanings of words which, for the Greeks, said Being. Discerning these meanings
was an extraordinary challenge. According to Heidegger, the great thinking of these
philosophers was non-conceptual thinking, and therefore radically diff erent from
our current practice of reasoning, that is, comparing and contrasting propositions
that each state some relationship between a subject and its predicate. Subjects and
predicates are always and already generalized abstractions drawn from the particu-
larities of lived experience.
“
Concept and system alike are alien to Greek thinking. [...] The
interpretation of Greek thinking that is guided by modern
conceptual thinking not only remains inappropriate for Greek
thinking; it also keeps us from hearing the appeal of the prob-
lematic of Greek thinking, and thus from being held to a con-
stantly more urgent summons to go on questioning. (WCT 213)
T
Keep in mind that when we talk about a new way of thinking, we are introducing a
topic that cannot be brought to mind in our current way of thinking. So whatever
you thought when you read that phrase isn’t it.
Of the words used by the Pre-Socratics, none is more challenging than physis
(pronounced foo’-sis). What was said in this word, for the Greeks, was what Heideg-
ger calls the power that emerges. The original force of the word has been lost to us;
and it is the judgment of the scholar Charles E. Scott that if we can think physis as
the Greeks did, we will “find ourselves in an original dimension of our history,” one
that has been lost almost since its inception (A Companion to Heidegger’s Introduc-
(
tion to Metaphysics 26).
But to translate the Greek terms successfully, Heidegger insists, we must first
translate ourselves to the source of what comes to language in their saying. Since in
each pre-Socratic fragment the background from which it speaks is spoken as well,
we must “seek the opportunity which will let us cross over to that source first of all
SESSION THREE INTERVAL
outside the fragment itself; it must be an opportunity which will let us experience
f
what ta onta [beings], thought in Greek, says” (EGT 28, emphasis added).
T
This book proposes that the transformational experience made available in The
Forum provides that opportunity. We show in this book that The Forum experience is
consistent in significant ways with the experience in language that Heidegger aimed
to evoke in his thinking. Further, since Heidegger is analogizing his understanding of
Being with the experience of the Pre-Socratics, we invoke the principle of transitive
equality and propose that The Forum, through its intentional dialogic transactions,
provides the opportunity called for in the passage above—it allows us to experience,
outside the Greek fragments themselves, the meaning of physis and ta onta.
Blossoming Emergence
Heidegger summarizes the complexity of physis here:
“
Now what does the word physis say? It says what emerges from
s
itself (for example, the emergence, the blossoming, of a rose),
the unfolding that opens itself up, the coming-into-appearance
in such unfolding, and holding itself and persisting in appear-
ance—in short, the emerging-abiding sway. . . . Physis is the
event of standing forth,
h arising from the concealed and thus en-
abling the concealed to take its stand for the first time. (IM 15-16)
M
This short but dense passage suggests the dynamic of physis—emerging, unfolding,
standing forth—as well as its complications. The word at once designates a process
(blossoming), the entity that emerges in that process (the rose), and finally the
phenomenon that comprises both the emergence and the rose itself, which is
named here the emerging-abiding sway. Note further that as the rose (the being)
emerges into unconcealment (the world), it brings with it the concealed from which it
has emerged—the sway, the Being of the emergent being—and thereby brings what
has been concealed to stand “for the first time” in the world of meaning.
The word sway is a translation of Heidegger’s German word Walten. This is sway
in the sense of holding sway, by exercising rule or dominance over some realm.
But the term inevitably sounds overtones of persistent, back-and-forth vacillation,
a quality appropriate to any discussion of Being. In his writing about the Greeks,
Heidegger uses both physis and sway as designations for the realm of Being, and
sometimes he seems to be using them interchangeably. More oft en, however, the
terms serve to distinguish Being in two diff erent contexts, or stages. Of course, Being
cannot have a context, or anything at all like stages; but to talk about a topic that
cannot be talked about, one must tell some lies.
Forum Day Three: Session Three Interval 265
It may be helpful to consider the situation this way:
For the Pre-Socratic Greek thinkers, to whom a new level of world-awareness was
becoming accessible, pre-phenomena presented themselves in a state of “originary
unity”—an “overwhelming coming-to-presence that has not yet been surmounted
in thinking” (IM 67), an upheaval of entities and forces not yet held in language, their
M
boundaries uncertain, their natures and relationships not yet fully distinguished.
To use a phrase that is central in the work of both Erhard and Heidegger (a term
further discussed at the Session Two Interval), we might say that these pre-phenomena
lived as possibilities for Being. As undistinguished, however, they swam without
limits in the realm of possibility. The sway designates that realm, a realm of Being
which is not yet in-the-world but is on the verge. These pre-phenomena may also be
usefully understood as possible meanings, or not-yet-meanings, and the sway may
therefore be seen as a realm of meaninglessness (an experience of this realm—which
Heidegger refers to as the Nothing—will be seen to be a critical aspect of The Forum
transformation). The not-yet-meanings, presumably, might include both physical
and non-physical pre- phenomena that had not yet pressed forward to be named
and distinguished as possibilities—such as microbes, sexual abuse, gravity, ethnici-
ty, digital communication, homophobia, and egotism.
Heidegger has distinguished a mode of speaking he calls Saying, which has
the force of bringing forth, rather than merely re-presenting. “The essential being
of language,” he says, “is Saying as Showing” (OWL 123). This is languaging that
generates. In the speaking of the Greeks, which Heidegger calls originative Saying,
a world was brought forth.
Physis, then, is: Being brought forth by originative Saying to stand in the world;
as well as the beings brought forth and set into limits by the naming; as well as the
process by which beings and Being emerge. Physis is the “event of standing forth,
arising from the concealed and thus enabling the concealed to take its stand for the
first time” (IM 16).
All of this, as we have said, is essentially talk about something that cannot be
talked about, and here Heidegger scholar Susan Schoenbohm suggests the chal-
lenge we face in attempting to analyze this phenomenon:
“
How, if at all, is it possible to render in words that which “is”
previous to any being, word, or name? How to articulate the
very coming-into-being of determination for the first time? [. . .]
In its most originary meaning, physis means the emerging, for
the first time, of something out of no determination at all . . . in
other words, the process of something’s coming-to-be-something
from nothing. (A Companion to Heidegger’s Introduction to
Metaphysics. 148)
For the Pre-Socratics, not-yet-beings were becoming manifest as possibilities. The
task for humans was to bring them forth, from a background of meaninglessness, to
stand as beings in a world of meaning.
Emerging into the world as a possibility, a being enters a lighting “from which
whatever lingers awhile in presence can be appropriately collected and brought
forward by mortal legein,” by human naming (EGT 70). Naming
T
for the Pre-Socratics
was not merely providing a label; it was distinguishing a possibility of meaning, and
therefore of Being. Here, in a passage from the second day of The Forum, Erhard
describes the process:
“
Distinction is an operation in language. In the normal course
of events you and I think of language as something we use to
report on something. . . . But now we’re distinguishing a new
kind of operation in language. It’s an operation in language
called generating. It’s as though I said “chair” and a chair fell
out of my mouth. . . . What distinguishing is, is to take some-
thing like an undiff erentiated mass and to bring forth from
that mass a realm of possibility.y  Distinction gives existence.
It makes existence possible.
From the undiff erentiated mass of the sway, the Pre-Socratics were distinguishing
the possibilities of a world.
Heidegger describes the events of this time as a process of strife, “not war
in the human sense” but “strife that holds sway” (IM 67, emphasis added). The
Greeks were engaged in a struggle to bring physis—the turbulent sway, vacillating
in its persistent emergence and withdrawal—to stand in the world, by naming and
diff erentiating its elements as beings:
“
As Heraclitus thinks it, struggle first and foremost allows what
essentially unfolds to step apart from each other in opposition,
first allows position and status and rank to establish themselves
in coming to presence. In such a stepping apart, cleft s, intervals,
distances and joints open themselves up. In con-frontation,
world comes to be. [. . .] This breaking forth, breaking up, cap-
turing and subjugating is in itself the first opening of beings as
sea, as earth,
s
as animal. (
s
IM 67, 174)
M
266
SPEAKING BEING
In Heidegger’s imagining of this process as he finds it in the fragments of the Pre-
Socratics, we find a saga of violent images and primal struggle, at “the dawn of
early times in the land of evening” (EGT 18). He is not aiming to provide a record
of events, since events of the time are necessarily shrouded in darkness. His tale,
he says, must therefore be less natural science than mythology (IM 173). He is
presenting an account of the forces that must have been at play as human beings,
and their world, emerged into a crucial evolutionary phase, and the thinkers of the
time struggled to engage that emergence. In Heidegger’s account, the engagement
is violent.
But where in the world are these violent events occurring? This is not, aft er all,
a saga of nations in battle, but a story of thinkers thinking; and certainly it was on
one level an intellectual event—a struggle of minds to engage and comprehend the
new, an “internal” process of perception and deliberation. But that process was at
the same time bringing forth a world into the world for the first time. This world was
not “out there,” waiting to be labeled; world arose (as it continues to arise) in its
apprehension by human Being-in-the-world. These primordial events, then, were
occurring at the wavering interface between looking and thinking and naming.
Further, in the process of naming, and thereby creating an order of rank and
place in a world of meaning, Heidegger says that the Greeks were leaving the realm
of mythology and entering history. They were the beings into whose evolutionary
path had emerged the gift  of language. Now they were recognizing the inescap-
able obligation of the gift : humans must unconceal beings and name them as the
beings they are, opening them to existence and providing that existence with limits.
This was the task of the Pre-Socratic thinkers, as well as the poets, statesmen, and
artisans through whose work Greek culture developed: “Against the overwhelming
sway, they throw the counterweight of their work and capture in this work the world
that is thereby opened up” (IM 68).
“
The temple, in its standing there, first gives to things their
look and to men their outlook on themselves. . . . It is the
same with the sculpture of the god, votive off ering of the
victor in the athletic games. It is not a portrait whose purpose
is to make it easier to realize how the god looks; rather, it is a
work that lets the god himself be present and thus is the god
himself. (“OWA” in PLT 43)
T
Indeed, Heidegger writes, the “nature of art, on which both the art work and the
artist depend, is the setting-itself-into-work of truth” (“OWA” in PLT 72). And in
responding to the demand of truth setting-itself-into-work, humanity was for
the first time “coming to itself”: “The selfhood of humanity means this: it has to
transform the Being that opens itself up to it into history, and thus bring itself to a
stand” (IM 160). And as the Greeks opened themselves into history, says Heidegger,
the question about their own Being underwent a change from “What is humanity?”
into the form “Who is humanity?” (IM 160).
Like many of the questions raised in Heidegger’s thinking, this one leaves us
thinking a precarious balance between human agency and evolutionary forces. At
this distance we cannot conceptualize the situation; Heidegger hints at its nature:
“
the violence-doing of poetic saying, of thoughtful projection,
of constructive building, of state-creating action, is not an
application of faculties that the human being has, but is a dis-
ciplining and disposing of the violent forces by virtue of which
beings disclose themselves as such, insofar as the human
being enters into them. This disclosedness of beings is the
violence that humanity has to conquer in order to be itself first
of all, that is, to be historical in doing violence in the midst of
beings. (IM 175)
M
But Heidegger challenges
“
the opinion human beings cherish of themselves as those who
have invented and who could have invented language and
understanding, building and poetry. How is humanity ever
supposed to have invented that . . . due to which humanity
itself can be as humanity in the first place? (IM 174)
M
The struggle meant here is originary struggle, for it allows
those that struggle to originate as such in the first place. . . .
(IM 68)
M
This situation creates an interesting chicken-or-egg challenge for thinking: How
did human beings create a world in language, when human beings themselves first
came to be human beings through language? The scholar Charles Guignon has pro-
vided this useful observation of the quandary:
Forum Day Three: Session Three Interval
267
“
[B]ecause the meaning of a word is determined by its web of
relations to other words as embedded in a set of linguistic
practices, and because humans are, as the Greeks saw, the
“language animal” (zoon logon echon),
n there is no way to
suppose that humans first existed and then later invented
first one word, then another, and so on. To see how language
emerged, then, we need to make use of something like Witt-
genstein’s metaphor, “Light dawns gradually over the whole.”
This image of a dawning light seems to be what is implied by
Heidegger’s descriptions of the originary struggle that is prior
to the appearance of humans and their explicit acts of naming.
(A Companion to Heidegger’s Introduction to Metaphysics.
(
41)
Heidegger might put it this way: just as the modern era is the technological age,
in which human being is enframed in the service of technological devices, the age
of the Pre-Socratics was the age of the dawning light, when for a brief historical
moment a full experience of Being was made available to human Being-in-the-
world.
The struggle for the Greeks, then, was to seize this moment, individuating
beings into their meaningful places in the world while at the same time retaining
their essential relation to the sway, and thus their fundamental orientation to Being.
For Heidegger, the greatness of the Pre-Socratics consisted in their recognition of
this challenge, and its articulation in their thinking. At the same time, the promise of
this achievement for Western thinking has been lost. As we proceed in this series of
intervals on the forgetting of Being, we will consider further the nature of this loss.

SPEAKING BEING
The Forum resumed at 10 pm, following the dinner break. The four TV monitors located at
various points in the room have been turned on, so that the participants now have the option of
watching the action on the monitors rather than directly. Erhard and Kipp began by interacting
with participants’ sharing.
KIPP
Who would like to share what’s happening?
ANDY
I had a terrifi c time at dinner. And anything beyond “I’m here and I speak” is a joke. Well yeah
because, nothing. It’s great.
KIPP
When it is.
ANDY
Yeah.
KIPP
When it’s great it’s great, when it’s not it’s not. Thank you very much.
DON
I basically got tired of listening to people’s shit. A lot of the observation I made was people fell
back into story telling. And I stopped listening. I didn’t enjoy it.
KIPP
Okay.
DON
I didn’t enjoy that at all.
KIPP
So what?
DON
Well, yeah, right. I just like the meat and potatoes. That good stuff .
KIPP
But so what? You’ve got it that it should be some way.
DON
Right.
FORUM DAY THREE:

KIPP
As long as you’ve got some way you think it should be, that means it means something. And as
long as it means something, that meaning has you.
DON
Exactly.
KIPP
Thank you.
(Applause)
SANFORD
I would like to share where I’m at right now and I’m just being.
KIPP
Great! Just being.
SANFORD
Yeah.
KIPP
And the only time you’re being is when?
SANFORD
Right now.
KIPP
When you’re being. And the only time I’m going to catch you not being is when? When you’re
not being.
SANFORD
Yeah.
KIPP
Thank you very much. Fred?
FRED
I fi nally got down to my big racket of rackets and that’s being sad.
ERHARD
Listen up here. You may not be sad; you may be something else. What you always are or often
are, that you don’t want to be? That’s a racket.

وس در نزدیکی نشسته بود. مولی (ادامه گریه)
من به پدر و مادرم زنگ زدم. من نمی دانستم چگونه این کار را انجام دهم. من فقط آنجا ایستاده بودم. آنها هر دو اجتماعی بودند
کارگران ، بازنشسته. من نمی دانستم چگونه این را بگویم. و آنچه من احساس کردم این بود که تمام آنچه آنها تا به حال انجام داده اند
من عاشق من است. همین بود مهم نیست چه چیزی ، این عشق بود. مثل ادن بود. به نوعی برگشتم
در ادن همه چیز همه چیز بود. آنها پرسیدند که چه اشتباهی است. گفتم هیچ چیز وجود ندارد
نگران باشید من به آنها گفتم که آنها را دوست دارم و می دانستم که آنها مرا دوست دارند. "من از این همه چیز صدمه دیده ام
این اتفاق افتاد ، اما من می دانم که هر کاری که انجام داده اید از عشق انجام شده است. " و آنها شروع کردند
داستانهای آنها را به من می گویند و کارهای مددکار اجتماعی خود را انجام می دهند. آنچه من کردم این است که من نمی دانستم
خیلی در مورد آنها درز
مردم عاشق همه این موارد فرآیند هستند. به همین دلیل آنها پایان یافتند که این انجمن چهار روز است و
یک شب به اندازه کافی طولانی نیست عذاب کافی برای آن وجود ندارد. وقتی می توانید با داستان باشید ،
شما با آن گیر نمی کنید. و اگر نمی توانید با داستان باشید ، آنها می خواهند آن را بگویند
بارها و بارها و بارها و بارها زیرا نمی توانید با آن باشید. روز اول انجمن: جلسه سه 257

و بعد به قسمت عمیق تر داستان رسیدیم. پدرم به من گفت چقدر من این کار را نکردم
از آنچه او به من داد قدردانی کنید ، و مادرم گفت که من وقتی رفتم آنها را رها کردم
کالج ... erhard
نگه دارید ، من می خواهم همه این را بدست آورند. (با صدای بلند)
آنها یک داستان بزرگ لعنتی نیز دارند! آنها داستان خود را گرفتند. آیا می توانید داستان را تصور کنید
مادر است؟ مادر من هیچ داستانی ندارد. او می تواند یک داستان داشته باشد. بنابراین شما توجه می کردید
که آنها یک داستان دارند. مولی
من تمام عمر عصبانیت خود را وحشت زده ام. و من هر کاری می توانم انجام دهم تا از عصبانیت جلوگیری کنم. من این کار را می کنم
با شوهرم با آنها روی این طاقچه ایستاده اید. عصبانیت مرا می کشد
پایین به دره. من comatose می شوم. درز
درست است ، شما یک بار برای زنده ماندن با والدین خود یک بار کماتوس شدید. مولی
من کاماتوز بودم درز
وقتی اینطور خالی و بی معنی است و خالی و بی معنی است که خالی است
و بی معنی است ، و شما می توانید بدون توجه به این که چه چیزی است ، با داستان دیگری باشید ، شما بی ترس هستید. بدون ترس نیازی به شجاعت ندارید. مولی
عصبانیت پدرم برای تغییر من را ترساند. من او را دوست داشتم. درز
این طور نیست که شما عصبانی بودن او را دوست دارید یا تأیید می کنید. او عصبانی است ، این همه است. و وقتی می توانید باشید
با عصبانیت او ناپدید می شود. وقتی باید سعی کنید کاری انجام دهید تا او را از عصبانیت بدست آورید ،
یا او را مجبور کنید که از عصبانیت جلوگیری کند ، یا برخی دیگر ، عصبانیت مهم نیست که چقدر خوب است
Ploy است. من این را می دانم چون با بچه های شما صحبت می کنم. آنها می بخشند اما فراموش نمی کنند ، تا زمانی که شما نمی توانید
با هر آنچه که آنها به یاد می آورند باشید. مولی
من مجبور نیستم چیزی را اثبات کنم. درز

تا به امروز ما در مورد گه سگ صحبت کرده ایم. اکنون می خواهیم در مورد حقیقت صحبت کنیم. حقیقت
در مورد حقیقت این است که به معنای چیزی نیست. این فقط حقیقت است مردم گاهی اوقات انجام می دهند
در حقیقت گیر کنید. بعضی اوقات آنها بر حقیقت می افتند. اما آنها همواره قدرت را می خورند
از آن ، ارزش حقیقت از آن خارج شده و آن را به یک پوسته خالی تبدیل کنید. و آنها این کار را با تلاش می کنند
حقیقت را مفید کنید. حقیقت بی فایده است. منظور من این است که حقیقت چیزی را توجیه نمی کند. اگر
شما در حقیقت گیر می کنید ، یا یک خاکستر بینش داشتید ، و در صورت این کار از آن برای توضیح چیزی استفاده می کنید
درست بود ، اکنون درست نیست ، زیرا شما حقیقت را از زمینه ای که در آن وجود دارد خارج کرده اید ،
که زمینه بی فایده است ، و آن را در شرایطی قرار دهید که در آن نمی تواند به عنوان حقیقت وجود داشته باشد ، یعنی
"استفاده". حقیقت بی فایده است. هیچ نسخه ای نمی دهد. هیچ. این هرگز مبنای یک قانون نیست ، هرگز
مبنای نسخه. حقیقت بی فایده است. بنابراین هر کاری که بر اساس حقیقت انجام می دهید این است
بر اساس گلوله. شما از حقیقت استفاده نمی کنید ؛ حقیقت از شما استفاده می کند. اگر می خواهید رابطه داشته باشید
با حقیقت ، مکانی باشید تا حقیقت به سر کار برود. سعی نکنید از آن استفاده کنید ، زیرا وقتی سعی می کنید
برای استفاده از آن به هر طریقی ، ارزش حقیقت خود را از دست می دهد. اگر می خواهید شواهدی برای آن داشته باشید ، به اطراف نگاه کنید
جهان ، و مکانهایی که شما بزرگترین تخریب ، شرورترین چیزها را خواهید داشت - آن چیزها
به نام حقیقت انجام شد. با حقیقت لعنتی بگذارید باشد بگذارید از شما استفاده کند. بگذارید باشد
و بگذارید از شما استفاده کند. سعی نکنید از آن استفاده کنید. چون اگر خوش شانس باشید و از حقیقت گیر افتادید
و سپس سعی کردید از آن استفاده کنید ، شما تمام ارزش حقیقت را که در آن داشت ، مکیدید. تمام قدرتی که به عنوان
حقیقت از بین رفته است.*
اگر در حقیقت گیر می کنید ، یا فلاش دارید
از بینش ، و شما از آن برای توضیح چیزی استفاده می کنید ،
اگر درست بود ، اکنون درست نیست ، زیرا شما
حقیقت را از زمینه ای که در آن قرار گرفته است
وجود دارد ، که زمینه بی فایده است ، و آن را وارد کنید
زمینه ای که در آن نمی تواند به عنوان حقیقت وجود داشته باشد ،
که "استفاده" است.

فراموشی بودن بودن ، قسمت پنجم از هشت: فیزیک
برای به دست آوردن بینش از ماهیت گریزان تحول ، ما در حال ردیابی تاریخ هستیم
از وجود ، همانطور که هایدگر در خواندن یونانی پیش از سوکراسی کشف کرده است
فیلسوفان هنگامی که هایدگر از پیش از جامعه صحبت می کند ، او اغلب می گوید "
یونانیان "؛ با این حال ، همانطور که نشان خواهیم داد ، سطح بینش حاصل از این متفکران
به احتمال زیاد توسط Hoi Polloi ، جمعیت یونان به طور کلی به اشتراک گذاشته نشده است. یکی از وظایف مورد نیاز پروژه هایدگر ، تمایز اصلی بود
معانی کلماتی که برای یونانیان گفتند. تشخیص این معانی
یک چالش خارق العاده بود. به گفته هایدگر ، تفکر بزرگ اینها
فیلسوفان تفکر غیر مفهومی بودند ، بنابراین کاملاً متفاوت از آن است
عمل فعلی استدلال ما ، یعنی مقایسه و گزاره های متضاد
که هر یک از آنها بین یک موضوع و محمول آن ارتباط برقرار می کند. سوژه ها و
پیش بینی ها همیشه و در حال حاضر انتزاعی هستند که از ویژه گرفته شده اند
لاروهای تجربه زندگی. "
مفهوم و سیستم به طور یکسان با تفکر یونانی بیگانه است. [...]
تفسیر تفکر یونانی که توسط مدرن هدایت می شود
تفکر مفهومی نه تنها برای یونانی نامناسب است
تفکر همچنین ما را از شنیدن درخواست تجدیدنظر باز می دارد
لیماتیک تفکر یونانی ، و به این ترتیب از نگه داشتن یک
احضار فوری تر برای ادامه سؤال. (WCT 213)
حرف
به خاطر داشته باشید که وقتی در مورد یک روش جدید تفکر صحبت می کنیم ، ما در حال معرفی هستیم
موضوعی که نمی تواند در روش تفکر فعلی ما به ذهن متبادر شود. بنابراین هر چه
فکر کردید وقتی می خوانید این عبارت اینگونه نیست. از میان کلماتی که پیش از سکوراتیک استفاده می شود ، هیچ یک چالش برانگیزتر از فیزیک نیست
(تلفظ foo's-sis). آنچه در این کلام گفته شد ، برای یونانیان ، همان چیزی بود که هایدگ-
GER قدرتی را که پدیدار می شود ، می نامد. نیروی اصلی این کلمه برای ما از بین رفته است.
و این داوری محقق چارلز E. اسکات است که اگر بتوانیم به عنوان فیزیکی فکر کنیم
یونانیان این کار را کردند ، ما "خود را در بعد اصلی از تاریخ خود پیدا خواهیم کرد"
این تقریباً از بدو تأسیس از بین رفته است (همراهی با معرفی هایدگر-
(
Tion to Metaphysics 26). اما برای ترجمه اصطلاحات یونانی با موفقیت ، هایدگر اصرار دارد ، ابتدا باید
خود را به منبع آنچه در گفته آنها به زبان می آید ترجمه کنیم. از آنجا که در
هر قطعه قبل از سوکراتیک پس زمینه ای که از آن صحبت می کند نیز گفته می شود ،
ما باید "به دنبال فرصتی باشیم که به ما اجازه دهد اول از همه به آن منبع بپردازیم
جلسه سه فاصله
خارج از قطعه خود ؛ این باید فرصتی باشد که به ما امکان تجربه را می دهد
ج
آنچه که به زبان یونانی فکر می کند ، می گوید: "(EGT 28 ، تأکید اضافه شده است).
این کتاب پیشنهاد می کند که تجربه تحول آمیز در دسترس است
انجمن این فرصت را فراهم می کند. ما در این کتاب نشان می دهیم که تجربه انجمن است
سازگار با روشهای مهم با تجربه در زبان که هایدگر
تا در تفکر او بیرون بیاید. علاوه بر این ، از آنجا که هایدگر درک خود را از
با تجربه پیش از سوکراتیک ها ، ما از اصل گذرا استفاده می کنیم
برابری و پیشنهاد می کند که این انجمن از طریق معاملات دیالوگ عمدی خود ،
فرصتی را فراهم می کند که در متن بالا خواسته شده است - این امکان را به ما می دهد تا تجربه کنیم ،
در خارج از خود قطعات یونانی ، معنای فیزیک و Ta onta. ظهور شکوفا
هایدگر پیچیدگی فیزیک را در اینجا خلاصه می کند:
"
حالا کلمه فیزیکی چه می گوید؟ این می گوید آنچه از
حرف
خود (به عنوان مثال ، ظهور ، شکوفه ، گل رز) ،
آشکار که خودش را باز می کند ، ظاهر می شود
در چنین آشکار ، و نگه داشتن خود و ادامه در ظاهر
به طور خلاصه ، نوسان در حال ظهور. بشر بشر بشر فیزیک است
رویداد ایستادن ،
ساعت ناشی از پنهان و در نتیجه
برای اولین بار از پنهان کردن برای موضع گیری خود استفاده می کند. (IM 15-16)
مگس
این گذرگاه کوتاه اما متراکم نشان دهنده پویایی فیزیک است - ظهور ، آشکار شدن ،
ایستادن در مقابل - و همچنین عوارض آن. کلمه به یکباره یک فرایند را تعیین می کند
(شکوفه) ، موجودی که در آن فرآیند (گل رز) ظاهر می شود ، و در نهایت
پدیده ای که هم ظهور و هم گل رز را شامل می شود ، یعنی
در اینجا نوسان در حال ظهور نامگذاری شده است. بیشتر توجه داشته باشید که به عنوان گل رز (وجود)
در عدم وجود (جهان) ظهور می کند ، آن را پنهان می کند که از آن استفاده می کند
ظهور کرده است - نوسان ، وجود موجود در ظهور - و از این طریق چه چیزی را به ارمغان می آورد
پنهان شده است تا "برای اولین بار" در دنیای معنا بایستد. کلمه Sway ترجمه ای از کلمه آلمانی هایدگر Walten است. این نوسان است
به معنای نگه داشتن نوسان ، با اعمال قانون یا تسلط بر برخی قلمروها. اما اصطلاح ناگزیر به نظر می رسد بیش از حد از خالی شدن مداوم ، عقب و جلو ،
کیفیت متناسب با هر بحث در مورد وجود. در نوشتن او در مورد یونانیان ،
هایدگر از هر دو فیزیک و نوسان به عنوان تعیین کننده قلمرو هستی استفاده می کند و
بعضی اوقات به نظر می رسد که او به طور متناوب از آنها استفاده می کند. با این حال ، بیشتر از همه
اصطلاحات برای تمایز بودن در دو زمینه متفاوت یا مرحله انجام می شود. البته بودن
نمی توان زمینه ای یا هر چیزی مانند مراحل را داشت. اما برای صحبت در مورد موضوعی که
نمی توان در مورد آن صحبت کرد ، باید برخی از دروغ ها را بیان کرد. روز اول انجمن: جلسه سه فاصله 265
ممکن است در نظر گرفتن وضعیت از این طریق مفید باشد:
برای متفکران یونانی قبل از سوکراتیک ، که سطح جدیدی از آگاهی از جهان بود
در دسترس بودن ، پیش از فنومنا خود را در حالت "اصالت" ارائه داد
وحدت "-" بیش از حد فراگیر که هنوز برطرف نشده است
در فکر کردن "(IM 67) ، یک تحول از نهادها و نیروهایی که هنوز به زبان آنها برگزار نشده اند
مگس
مرزها نامشخص است ، طبیعت و روابط آنها هنوز کاملاً متمایز نشده است. برای استفاده از عبارتی که در کار Erhard و Heidegger مهم است (یک اصطلاح
بیشتر در جلسه دو بازه بحث شده است) ، ممکن است بگوییم که این قبل از فنومنا
به عنوان امکاناتی برای بودن زندگی می کرد. با این حال ، آنها بدون درک ، بدون شنا
محدودیت در قلمرو امکان. نوسان آن قلمرو را تعیین می کند ، قلمرو بودن
که هنوز در جهان نیست اما در آستانه قرار دارد. این پیش از فنوم نیز ممکن است باشد
به طور مفید به عنوان معانی ممکن ، یا در عین حال به معنای متوسط ​​درک می شود و ممکن است نوسان داشته باشد
بنابراین به عنوان قلمرو بی معنی دیده می شود (تجربه این قلمرو - که
هایدگر به عنوان هیچ چیز یاد می کند - به نظر می رسد که جنبه مهم این انجمن است
تحول). احتمالاً هنوز هم به معنای متوسط ​​ممکن است شامل هر دو فیزیکی باشد
و پدیده های غیر جسمی که هنوز تحت فشار قرار نگرفته اند تا نامگذاری شوند
و به عنوان امکانات متمایز است- مانند میکروب ها ، سوء استفاده جنسی ، گرانش ، قومی
TY ، ارتباطات دیجیتال ، همو هراسی و خودآرایی. هایدگر شیوه صحبت کردن را که گفته است ، متمایز کرده است ،
نیروی بیرون آوردن ، به جای صرفاً ارائه مجدد. "موجود اساسی
او می گوید ، "به عنوان نمایش" می گوید "(جغد 123). این زبان است
تولید می کند در صحبت از یونانیان ، که هایدگر آن را بیان اصلی می نامد ،
دنیایی به وجود آمد. بنابراین ، فیزیس این است: با گفتن مبداء برای ایستادن در جهان به وجود آمده است.
و همچنین موجوداتی که با نامگذاری مطرح شده و محدود شده اند. و همچنین
فرایندی که موجودات و ظهور می کنند. Physis "رویداد ایستادن" است.
ناشی از پنهان و در نتیجه پنهان کردن مخفیگاه برای موضع گیری خود برای
بار اول "(IM 16). همه اینها ، همانطور که گفتیم ، اساساً در مورد چیزی که نمی تواند صحبت کند
در مورد آن صحبت کرد ، و در اینجا Susan Schoenbohm ، محقق Heidegger پیشنهاد می کند
lenge ما در تلاش برای تجزیه و تحلیل این پدیده با آن روبرو هستیم:
"
چگونه ، اگر اصلاً ، آیا می توان کلماتی را که "است" بیان کنید
قبل از هر موجود ، کلمه یا نام؟ نحوه بیان
برای اولین بار برای اولین بار در حال عزم هستید؟ [ بشر .]
در اصل اصلی خود ، فیزیک به معنای ظهور است ، برای
اولین بار ، از چیزی که به هیچ وجه تعیین نشده است. بشر بشر در
کلمات دیگر ، روند چیزی در حال آمدن است
از هیچ چیز (همراهی با معرفی هایدگر در
متافیزیک 148)
برای پیش از سکوراتیک ها ، نه در عین حال ، به عنوان امکانات آشکار می شدند. در
وظیفه انسان این بود که آنها را از پس زمینه بی معنی بودن به
در دنیای معنا مانند موجودات بایستید. به عنوان یک امکان در جهان ظاهر می شود ، یک موجود در یک روشنایی "از آن
هرچه در حضور در حضور در هر چه ماندگار باشد ، می تواند به طور مناسب جمع آوری و آورده شود
به جلو توسط فانی لژین ، "با نامگذاری انسان (EGT 70). نامگذاری
حرف
برای پیش سکوراتیک
صرفاً تهیه برچسب نبود. این تمایز امکان معنا بود ، و
بنابراین وجود در اینجا ، در یک گذر از روز دوم انجمن ، erhard
روند را توصیف می کند:
"
تمایز عملیاتی در زبان است. در دوره عادی
از وقایع شما و من به زبان به عنوان چیزی که از آن استفاده می کنیم فکر می کنیم
گزارش در مورد چیزی بشر بشر بشر اما اکنون ما یک جدید را متمایز می کنیم
نوع عملکرد در زبان. این یک عمل به زبان است
به نام تولید به نظر می رسد که من گفتم "صندلی" و یک صندلی افتاد
بیرون از دهانم بشر بشر بشر آنچه متمایز است ، این است که برخی از
چیزی مانند یک توده ناشناخته و برای بیرون آوردن
این توده یک قلمرو امکان وجود دارد. تمایز وجود دارد. این وجود را امکان پذیر می کند. از توده نادیده گرفته شده از نوسان ، قبل از سونوگرافی متمایز بود
امکانات یک جهان. هایدگر وقایع این زمان را فرایند نزاع توصیف می کند ، "نه جنگ
به معنای انسانی "اما" نزاع که در حال چرخش است "(IM 67 ، تأکید اضافه شده است).
یونانیان درگیر تلاش برای به وجود آوردن فیزیک شدند - نوسان آشفته ، خالی
در ظهور مداوم و عقب نشینی آن - برای ایستادن در جهان ، با نامگذاری و
تفاوت عناصر آن به عنوان موجودات:
"
همانطور که هراکلیتوس آن را فکر می کند ، قبل از هر چیز مبارزه می کند
اساساً برای جدایی از یکدیگر در مخالفت ، آشکار می شود ،
اول اجازه می دهد تا موقعیت و وضعیت و رتبه خود را تعیین کنند
در حضور در چنین قدم جدا ، شکاف S ، فواصل ،
مسافت ها و مفاصل خود را باز می کنند. در کنفرانس ،
جهان می آید. [ بشر .] این شکستن ، شکستن ، cap-

وجود
در تصور هایدگر از این فرایند ، زیرا او آن را در قطعات پیش از
سقراط ، ما حماسه ای از تصاویر خشونت آمیز و مبارزات اولیه را در "طلوع آفتاب" می یابیم
اوایل سرزمین عصر "(EGT 18). او قصد ندارد یک رکورد ارائه دهد
از وقایع ، از آنجا که وقایع زمان لزوماً در تاریکی کفپوش می شوند. داستان او ،
او می گوید ، بنابراین باید از اساطیر ، علم طبیعی کمتری داشته باشد (IM 173). او است
ارائه گزارشی از نیروهایی که باید به عنوان انسان در بازی بوده اند ،
و دنیای آنها ، در یک مرحله تکاملی مهم و متفکران
زمان تلاش کرد تا آن ظهور را درگیر کند. در حساب هایدگر ، نامزدی
خشن است اما این حوادث خشونت آمیز در کجا در جهان اتفاق می افتد؟ این نیست ، همه چیز ،
حماسه ملل در نبرد ، اما داستانی از فکر کردن متفکران ؛ و مطمئناً روشن بود
یک سطح یک رویداد فکری - یک مبارزه ذهن برای درگیر کردن و درک
جدید ، یک فرآیند "داخلی" ادراک و بحث. اما این روند در
در همین زمان برای اولین بار دنیایی را به جهان وارد کرد. این جهان بود
"در آنجا" نیست ، منتظر برچسب زدن است. جهان در آن به وجود آمد (همانطور که همچنان به وجود می آید) در آن
دلهره توسط انسان در جهان. پس از آن ، این حوادث ابتدایی بود
در رابط موج دار بین نگاه و تفکر و نامگذاری رخ می دهد. علاوه بر این ، در روند نامگذاری ، و در نتیجه ایجاد نظمی از رتبه و
هایدگر می گوید که یونانیان از قلمرو خارج می شدند
اساطیر و ورود به تاریخ. آنها موجوداتی بودند که در آن تکاملی بودند
مسیر هدیه زبان پدیدار شده بود. اکنون آنها در حال تشخیص این شکست بودند-
تعهد قادر به هدیه: انسان ها باید موجودات غیرقانونی را داشته باشند و آنها را به عنوان نامگذاری کنند
موجوداتی که وجود دارند ، آنها را به وجود می آورد و محدودیت هایی را فراهم می کند. این وظیفه متفکران پیش از سوکراسی و همچنین شاعران ، دولتمردان و
صنعتگرانی که از طریق کار یونانی کار کردند: "در برابر قریب به اتفاق
نوسان ، آنها ضد وزن کار خود را پرتاب می کنند و در این کار جهان را ضبط می کنند
بدین ترتیب باز شد "(IM 68)."
معبد ، در ایستاده خود در آنجا ، ابتدا به چیزهایی می دهد
نگاه کنید و به مردان نگاه خود را از خودشان نگاه کنید. بشر بشر بشر این است
همان با مجسمه خدا ، رأی دهندگان
ویکتور در بازی های ورزشی. این یک پرتره نیست که هدفش باشد
درک این مسئله که خدا به نظر می رسد آسان تر می شود. در عوض ، این یک است
کاری که به خود خدا اجازه می دهد حضور داشته باشد و بنابراین خدا است
خودش. ("OWA" در PLT 43)
حرف
در واقع ، هایدگر می نویسد ، "ماهیت هنر ، که بر روی آن هم کار هنری و هم
هنرمند وابسته است ، آیا خود تنظیم و کار حقیقت است "(" OWA "در PLT 72) و در
بشریت در پاسخ به تقاضای حقیقت-خود-کار-کار ، بشریت بود
اولین باری که "به خود می آید": "خودخواهی بشریت به معنای این است: باید
موجودی را که خود را تا آن به تاریخ باز می کند ، تغییر دهید و به این ترتیب خود را به یک
ایستاده "(IM 160). و همانطور که یونانیان خود را به تاریخ باز کردند ، می گوید هایدگر ،
سؤال در مورد خودشان تحت تغییر "بشریت چیست؟"
به شکل "بشریت کیست؟" (من 160). مانند بسیاری از سؤالات مطرح شده در تفکر هایدگر ، این یکی ما را ترک می کند
فکر کردن یک تعادل نامطلوب بین آژانس انسانی و نیروهای تکاملی. در
این فاصله ما نمی توانیم وضعیت را مفهوم سازی کنیم. هایدگر به طبیعت خود اشاره می کند:
"
خشونت بیان شاعرانه ، از پیش بینی متفکرانه ،
از ساختمان سازنده ، از اقدامات ایجاد دولت ، یک نیست
استفاده از دانشکده هایی که انسان دارد ، اما یک موضوع است
تنظیم و دفع نیروهای خشن به واسطه آنها
موجودات خود را به عنوان چنین فاش می کنند ، تا آنجا که انسان است
ورود به آنها این افشای موجودات است
خشونت هایی که بشریت باید فتح کند تا خود اول باشد
از همه ، یعنی تاریخی در انجام خشونت در میان
موجودات (من 175)
مگس
اما چالش های هایدگر
"
این عقیده که انسانها از خودشان گرامی دارند به عنوان کسانی که
اختراع کرده اند و چه کسی می تواند زبان را اختراع کند و
درک ، ساختمان و شعر. چگونه بشریت همیشه است
تصور می شود آن را اختراع کرده است. بشر بشر به خاطر آن بشریت
خود در وهله اول می تواند به عنوان بشریت باشد؟ (من 174)
مگس
مبارزاتی که در اینجا به معنای مبارزه با اصل است ، زیرا اجازه می دهد
آنهایی که در وهله اول تلاش می کنند به همین ترتیب سرچشمه بگیرند. بشر بشر بشر (من 68)
مگس
این وضعیت یک چالش جالب مرغ یا تخم مرغ برای تفکر ایجاد می کند: چگونه
آیا انسانها دنیایی را به زبان زبانی ایجاد می کنند ، وقتی که خود در ابتدا انسان ها
از طریق زبان به انسان تبدیل شد؟ محقق چارلز گیونون دارای
این مشاهدات مفید از quandary را نشان داد:
روز اول انجمن: جلسه سه جلسه

"
[b] به دلیل معنی یک کلمه توسط وب آن تعیین می شود
روابط با کلمات دیگر که در مجموعه ای از زبانی تعبیه شده است
عمل ، و به دلیل اینکه انسان ها ، همانطور که یونانیان دیدند ،
"حیوان زبان" (Zoon Logon Echon) ،
n هیچ راهی برای وجود ندارد
فرض کنید که انسان ابتدا وجود داشته و بعداً اختراع شده است
ابتدا یک کلمه ، سپس دیگری ، و غیره. برای دیدن چگونه زبان
بنابراین ، ما باید از چیزی مانند witt- استفاده کنیم-
استعاره Genstein ، "Light Dawns به تدریج در کل."
به نظر می رسد این تصویر از چراغ طلوع چیزی است که توسط آن دلالت دارد
توضیحات هایدگر از مبارزات اصلی که پیش از آن است
به ظاهر انسان و اعمال صریح آنها در نامگذاری. (همراهی با معرفی هایدگر در متافیزیک. ((
41)
هایدگر ممکن است اینگونه بیان کند: دقیقاً همانطور که دوران مدرن عصر تکنولوژیکی است ،
که در آن انسان در خدمت وسایل تکنولوژیکی ، سن قرار می گیرد
از قبل از سکوراتیک ، سن نور طلوع آفتاب بود ، هنگامی که برای یک تاریخی مختصر
لحظه ای که تجربه کامل بودن در اختیار انسان قرار گرفت
جهان پس از آن ، مبارزه برای یونانیان این بود که این لحظه را به دست آورد ،
موجودات در مکانهای معنی دار خود در جهان و در عین حال حفظ
رابطه اساسی آنها با نوسان و در نتیجه جهت گیری اساسی آنها به وجود. برای هایدگر ، عظمت پیش از سوکراتیک ها شامل شناخت آنها بود
این چالش و بیان آن در تفکر آنها. در عین حال ، قول
این دستاورد برای تفکر غربی از بین رفته است. همانطور که ما در این سری از
بازه های مربوط به فراموشی بودن ، ماهیت این ضرر را بیشتر خواهیم کرد. 268
