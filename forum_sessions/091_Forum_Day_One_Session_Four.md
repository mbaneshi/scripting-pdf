Forum Day One: Session Four

PARTICIPANT
My already always listening is “I’m very clever and I’ll prove it to you.”
ERHARD
See, there are times when “I’m very clever and I’ll prove it to you” is a very workable listening.
But if you’re already always “I’m very clever and I’ll prove it to you,” there are a lot of occasions
that doesn’t match.
PARTICIPANT
I have several of these. My listening is that “I’m not good enough.”
ERHARD
“I’m not good enough” almost always has got another listening, which is “I’m better than you
are.” “I’m not good enough but I’m better than you are.” You want to listen up. These guys are
being authentic about their own inauthenticity. These are not nice people. They are cold, calcu-
lating, conniving people. They are out to get you to like them. And it’s not them. They didn’t in-
vent that. And if this is the opening that I’m providing for the world to occur in, it’s not surpris-
ing how the world shows up. We have done some work facilitating meetings between American
and Soviet representatives. We discovered that the already always listening of the Americans is
“You can’t be trusted for your word; now let’s talk.” This made the results predictable.
PARTICIPANT
My always already listening is “I’m too smart and too quick, and I better not let anyone know
that.”
ERHARD
It’s the “already always way of listening.” I keep losing why the order is important, but there’s
some significance to the order. What is the already always listening that gives you being the way
you are? Believe it or not, the way you are is given to you by your listening.
PARTICIPANT
“You’re boring.”
ERHARD
We’re going to take a break. I want you to consider that the way you are is given to you by your
listening. I’m inviting you to get down to the already always listening, you know, as deep as you
can, however deep that happens to be. Clear?
The Forum adjourned for the final break of the day at 10 pm.
Jargon
Erhard’s influence on the language of Western culture has been significant. His
terminology, like Heidegger’s, has always been unusual and highly purposive, and
many of these words and phrases made their way into the public sphere, some to
lasting effect. But that language, in its casual use, began to lose its power. Heidegger
detailed this process of devolution in Being and Time:
SESSION FOUR INTERVAL
I hardly use the word “transformation” at all any more. . . . because
while it once was a word that people had to think about, struggle
to grasp, work on, that’s just not true anymore. The word no longer
wakes people up. Now, when you say “transformation,” the word
puts them to sleep—like they know what it means—they stop
thinking, looking, inquiring.
Instead, he said, as his ontological inquiry has developed, “the notions keep getting
said differently” (Simon, “Quarterbacks and Coaches: Tossing It Around with Werner
Erhard,” Family Therapy Networker, March–April 1986, 30–39).
Heidegger addressed his own confrontation with this situation in his essay “A
Dialogue on Language,” a transcript of his conversation with a Japanese scholar. At
one point Heidegger (referred to in the transcript as the Inquirer) mentions two of
the ideas that were central in his early work, hermeneutics and phenomenology.

SPEAKING BEING
In the language which is spoken when one expresses oneself, there
lies an average intelligibility; and in accordance with this intelligi-
bility the discourse which is communicated can be understood to a
considerable extent, even if the hearer does not bring himself into
such a kind of Being towards what the discourse is about as to have
a primordial understanding of it. We do not so much understand
the entities which are talked about; we already are listening only to
what-is-said-in-the-talk as such. What is said in the talk gets under-
stood; but what the talk is about is understood only approximately
and superficially. . . . Idle talk is the possibility of understanding
everything without previously making the thing one’s own. . . . Thus,
by its very nature, idle talk is a closing-off , since to go back to the
ground of what is talked about is something which it leaves undone.
(BT 212–213)
“
Erhard’s comments in a 1986 interview, discussing the evolution of his own
language use, echo Heidegger’s account of the process by which terms lose their
originative power. Many of the words he had used in his work, Erhard said, “even-
tually drifted into popular use.” They “lost the creative intention behind them and
degenerated into a kind of jargon.” Outside their original context, as Heidegger put
it, the terms no longer reached out into the “totality of involvements” in which their
significance was grounded (BT 200).
This was the fate of the term “transformation,” a central term to which Erhard
had assigned “an extremely precise meaning.” Today, he said, “you hear it every-
where. You read about it in business journals. It’s ‘hot.’ So, to some degree, it’s lost
its potency.” He continued:
[Japanese]: I am all the more puzzled that you have meanwhile
dropped both words.
[Inquirer]: That was done, not—as is so oft en thought—in order to
deny the significance of phenomenology, but in order to abandon
my own path of thinking to namelessness.
[Japanese]: An eff ort with which you will hardly be successful. . . .
[Inquirer]: . . . since one cannot get by in public without rubrics.
(“DL” in OWL 29)
“
What is essential in both Heidegger’s work and Erhard’s is what is unspoken and
therefore essentially nameless. Much of Erhard’s work during the four decades of its
evolution may be seen as the development of new rubrics (distinctions) to replace
those that have devolved into jargon, such that what is said makes present what
cannot be said in words.

SPEAKING BEING
The Forum resumed at 10:30 pm. Erhard began by inviting questions from the
participants. One participant, reviewing The Forum, shared that his already always
listening had altered as a result of that experience.
ERHARD (addressing the group)
He’s got a possibility beyond his thrown listening. He got it by owning his
thrown listening. There’s something called getting off  it. This is a sacred thing.
To get off  it is sacred. Now, what does getting off  it mean? It means he’s not
constrained to entertain that listening. He can hear himself listening and get
off  that listening. When his already always listening comes up, he is able to
own it, to embrace it, to be responsible for it. In the normal course of events,
if I found out my already always listening was disempowering I would try to
stop it. He didn’t change it. That’s the big secret. Because when you change it,
nothing changes.
(shifting tone)
This is a “you-gotta-get-this.” So listen up.
At the chalkboard, Erhard placed the chalk on the surface and moved it, so that
the chalk ended in a diff erent place but a line remained indicating the path of its
movement.
ERHARD (continuing)
Change persists. When you’re diff erent, what persists? That which you’re dif-
ferent than. So when you’re diff erent you’re the same, because the thing from
which you’re diff erent is still there. The more diff erence, the more persistence.
If you’re really diff erent, the thing you’re diff erent than has a big persistence.
If I’m a nice guy as a solution to a problem, the problem for which being a nice
guy is a solution stays in place. About ninety-nine percent of what you are,
you became as a solution to a problem. Education is a solution to being stupid.
When you solve a problem, what persists is the problem.
(to the participant)
So your listening that altered hadn’t solved the problem of your already always
listening.
(to the group)
He had embraced it. He was able to be with the problem.
(drawing two tangent circles on the board)
Can you imagine putting two solid objects in the same place at the same time?
If you did that, what would happen? They would disappear. Push them into
