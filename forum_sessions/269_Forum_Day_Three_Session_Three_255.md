Forum Day Three: Session Three 255
got that because I wrote my letter yesterday before I went to bed. And I didn’t have to wake up
to get there. If someone asked me what I would give up, if I snored, I could give up the idea if I
could stop myself from snoring.
KIPP
You only snore if you snore.
RICHARD
Well, there’s more to the story. I only snore in hotels.
KIPP
Got it.
RICHARD
I learned to snore in hotels. I lived in them for a year and a half.
KIPP
Clear.
ERHARD
What there is to get out of Richard’s share is that life is made up of trying to be. It’s made up of
trying not to be, and of trying to be. Is there any being in trying not to be or trying to be?
(Richard sits down and another participant stands)
MOLLY (in tears)
I came to The Forum on a mission from God to save WE & A. It’s actually not a joke. I mean: it
is a joke on me... What I found out is that my racket is being abandoned. And I found out that I
play my racket with God.
ERHARD
I don’t talk about God a lot, because I don’t have a license to talk about God. You didn’t pay me
to talk about God, so if somebody brings it up, I do what I can to avoid it, and if I can’t avoid
it, I say as little as I can. I don’t like talking to you about God because God’s a racket for you
and that’s disgusting. You need to listen to what Molly is saying because she knows both sides
of the coin...now. So we’re not going to have a lot of discussions about this. We’ll have this
discussion with Molly for everybody else. Go on.
MOLLY
I told my husband that when I was meditating that God told me to take The Forum, and he
said, “so how are you going to get in this time, ’cause they rejected you last time.” I said I
would play it their way. On the form I wrote what was so, but not the real so. It was the “how
to get in” so.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
And the other “so” was in order to something else.
MOLLY
Well the whole thing was an in-order-to.
ERHARD
Yeah, good. Do you have any idea how sacrilegious that is? God in-order-to.
MOLLY
Every time someone called me from The Forum I ripped them off , because I was this holy
person. I wasn’t there for them, because I was on a religious path. I faked it. When I got to The
Forum, I looked around to check out how tough a job it would be for God. And what I found
out was, that when I was four years old I could remember back, and I did this through the
process of completing with my parents.
(addressing Erhard)
I saw that I could trust you. And you said that the bonus points came with completing with
your parents. I saw that I’d never done that. I tried everything. I threw everything out. I saw that
I had paid $625... when you said that I had paid for it, and that if I was going to give it back for
free that I was a sucker... Whatever I heard that got me here was for me. I saw that I came to
The Forum to get The Forum. And you have to save your own soul.
(laughter and applause)
The room became very still as Molly spoke. Erhard sat on the platform in front of her, with Kipp and
Wes seated nearby.
MOLLY (continuing to cry)
I called my parents. I didn’t know how to do it. I was just standing there. They were both social
workers, retired. I didn’t know how to say this. And what I felt was that all they’d ever done for
me is love me. That was it. No matter what, it was love. It was like Eden. Somehow I was back
in Eden. Everything was everything. They asked what was wrong. I said there was nothing to
worry about. I told them I loved them and knew they loved me. “I’ve been hurt by all this stuff
that happened, but I get that everything you’ve done was done out of love.” And they started
telling me their stories, and doing their social worker stuff . What I got is that I didn’t know
much about them.
ERHARD
People love all that process stuff . That’s why they’re off ended that The Forum is four days and
one night. It’s not long enough. There’s not enough agony to it. When you can be with the story,
you don’t get stuck with it. And if you can’t be with the story, they’re going to keep telling it
over and over and over and over because you can’t be with it.
