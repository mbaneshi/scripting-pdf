Forum Day Four: Session Two 
429
KIPP
Chocolate or vanilla: Choose.
BILL
Vanilla.
KIPP
Vanilla! Perfect! Why did you choose vanilla? “I chose...”
BILL (to laughter)r
Can you give me a hint?
KIPP
A choice is to select freely and after consideration... “I chose...”
BILL
I chose vanilla because I want to experiment with a new taste.
KIPP
Perfect! So along came a thought—peep!...
(pulling another tissue out of the box
(
)
“because I want to experiment with a new taste,” right? And “because I want to experiment 
with a new taste” selected vanilla, and not you: That’s a clear-cut decision because it’s based on
the reason, the feeling, the consideration, the thought...
(holding many tissues)
See we’re starting to get “the mind” built here. This is what the mind is made up of, all those 
things, those thoughts, those feelings, those considerations. And you’re doing great, training
everyone in the room in these distinctions. I know it may not feel that way to you, but you’re 
doing great. Ready?
The demonstration continued, with Bill selecting a fl avor after Kipp presented the choice: because 
he only had two choices; because it’s there; because he decided to, etc. At each juncture Bill reiter-
ated his complaint that he knew the problem (how to make a choice using the word because, when
using because leads to making a decision) but that he didn’t know how to get out of it. 
BILL
I chose because I exhausted all my reasons.
KIPP
So the reason—peep!
