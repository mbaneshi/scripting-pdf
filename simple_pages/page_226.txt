SPEAKING BEING
When The Forum resumed at 4:30 pm, Kipp was on the platform. Erhard was present, seated on the 
platform’s edge. Kipp asked participants to share what they had found out about their lives. A young 
man named Tony stood and said that he had sensed “the joke of it all.” 
TONY (continuing)
I remembered when I was six my mom took me to Taiwan and once I got off  the plane there 
were all these children with missing fi ngers and hands and arms asking for money and I was 
terrifi ed. And I saw that everybody is afraid of everybody and that’s what’s wrong with this 
world. 
KIPP
When you got off  the airplane, what happened at that moment?
TONY
I felt really bad.
ERHARD
The most important thing you said is that it’s all a joke. That’s what we’ve been heading for the 
past couple of days. All that stuff  about rackets and being afraid and all that stuff —that’s not 
important. 
TONY
And I’ve been all afraid that “I’m not going to get what I came to get out of The Forum! I’m not 
going to be able to have what I want in my life.” 
ERHARD
You want to know what? You’re not!
TONY (laughing)
And now that we got that cleared...
ERHARD
Yeah, well, once everybody gets that cleared we can all go home.
TONY
There really is nothing to get.
ERHARD
That’s right.
TONY (laughing)
What the fuck am I doing in here?
