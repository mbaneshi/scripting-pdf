Forum Day One: Session One 
23
ERHARD
I only do this work with people for whom it’s going to be successful, so I’m not willing to do 
this work except on the basis that people chose to be here. What’s your choice?
KATHY
I choose to be in The Forum. 
ERHARD
No coercion? That’s your choice? Made freely?
KATHY
Yes. 
ERHARD
Thank you for going through the process in front of all these people.
Along with Kathy, two other people sat down. The only participant who remained standing was a 
young man in the front row named Bill, who spoke as soon as an assistant got a microphone to him:
BILL (angrily)
I think there’s kind of a thin line between choice and being compelled to do something because
someone cared enough to continuously call me up and get me here.
ERHARD (moving in to a face-to-face stance with Bill)
You’re an asshole, and somebody...
BILL
Your language is bad.
ERHARD
It’s much worse than you think it is. You don’t want to fuck with me.
BILL
You don’t scare me.
ERHARD
You’re in my game, my friend, you don’t want to fuck with me.
BILL
Someone should use language to try to clear a point.
ERHARD
I understand what you believe. I’m not interested.
