SPEAKING BEING
BILL
I don’t really have anything to discuss that I am confused about, but it’s what has set me free 
that makes me feel a lot better about my experience here. For one thing, I want to thank you 
Werner for tolerating my controlling nature. 
ERHARD
Yeah, and you and I needed to tolerate each other for it to work and so I want to thank you for 
tolerating my controlling nature, too. 
BILL (to laughter)
I came in this Forum with somewhat of a chip on my shoulder, 
(laughter)
...and I was kind of angry. I had a lot of rackets that I couldn’t see until many of you stood up to 
discuss them.
ERHARD (to the group)
This is called being big. This is called magnanimous. And it’s not that he is that. He gives 
himself that in this action. 
BILL
Anyway, I found that for myself I have a tendency to try to analyze behavior and try to explain 
things on my terms in order for me to be in a controlling advantage. I don’t like to be controlled 
at all. And at fi rst I felt like I was being controlled.
ERHARD
The word’s “dominated.”
BILL
Exactly. But what I was shown is that I can’t empower anybody. I lose love, lose self-expression, 
and I lose freedom.
ERHARD
And you lose power. When you dominate you lose power. Love is power. Happiness is power. 
Self-expression is power. Power is having your self realized in the world. That’s power. 
BILL
Right. I fi nd that through letting that controlling element go and accepting myself for the way 
I am, recognizing that I’m always already being that way, and yet being able to accept myself 
more, and it was especially a release to fi nd out that things I was putting a contingency on: My 
happiness is not contingent upon anything. 
ERHARD
That’s right. We’re about to talk about your happiness. You’re in the right place. Keep going.
