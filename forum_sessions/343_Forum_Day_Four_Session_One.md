Forum Day Four: Session One

KIPP
And that’s the way it’s going to be for you. How many of you have noticed things opening up
and closing, opening up and closing, opening up and closing, opening up and closing?
(many hands go up)
Put your hands down. Now, how many of you would like it to stay open forever?
(many hands go up)
And that’s what makes you stupid.
KENNETH
Whooo!
KIPP  (loudly)
Because as soon as it opens up you make opening up mean something. That’s the way life
should be now!
KENNETH
Yeah, that’s what I did.
KIPP
Yeah, you want an event. You don’t want to live; you want an event.
KENNETH
Yeah. I want a drama around the event.
KIPP
And so you’ll have drama around the event. Everybody wants an event, an easy answer, so they
don’t ever have to inquire again, or think again... Did you share with people?
KENNETH
Yeah.
KIPP
What happened? Who did you share with?
KENNETH
I shared with several people.
KIPP
What did you share? “I said...”

SPEAKING BEING
KENNETH
I shared about losing my job, about poor Kenneth, about why I feel there’s a poor Kenneth
there. I got relatively clear on that during the training why I have a poor Kenneth thing, what
that’s doing to my life. I didn’t get to the tears that I’ve been experiencing here. That’s new.
I didn’t have that in the training. I feel like my life the past two years has been going upside
down and it’s scaring the shit out of me.
KIPP
No, what happened is, you got laid off , and your marriage is...
KENNETH
My marriage is about to terminate.
KIPP
It’s about to terminate. You sound like it’s a computer turning off .
(laughter)
KENNETH
Really. Okay.
KIPP
And something about your house.
KENNETH
Right.
KIPP
Anything else?
KENNETH
I have a new relationship.
KIPP
Are you always this excited about that or is this a breakthrough?
(laughter)
KENNETH
That’s great, yeah. Pardon my schtick.
