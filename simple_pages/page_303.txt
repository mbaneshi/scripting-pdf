Forum Day Three: Session Four 
289
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Because given your past you’re probably not going to get off  it entirely, are you? 
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
And that’s sensible and intelligent dealing with the future as an extension of the past. Did you 
follow what I said?
JANE
A little.
ERHARD
When you said “I probably wouldn’t get off  it entirely,” I said that was an intelligent, sensible 
extension of your past into the future.
JANE
Okay.
ERHARD
Good. Now there’s a particular discussion I want to have with you now. Our previous 
discussions have been for your benefi t. This one I’m having for the benefi t of the group. I think 
you have something to contribute here; that you will be an example that will illustrate what I 
want people to be able to see as powerfully as anybody else in The Forum could illustrate it. I 
want to be straight with you and tell you that so that I can fi nd out if you’re willing to have this 
discussion with me. And you won’t know what that discussion is; you’ll have to take a chance. 
I’m not saying you won’t get any value out of it, because you may. I suspect you will. Probably. 
(Jane smiles)
Anybody see her smile like that before? Okay, so, you with me? Ready to do this?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Earlier we talked about when you were four, fi ve, or six, and what it looked like for someone 
of that age for your mother to be taken away... you get that it would look that way for a child 
that age, that “my mother left me, or abandoned me, or she was taken away”? By the way, it 
doesn’t make any diff erence that she can’t remember that. Remember you told me you couldn’t 
remember that very clearly? But we know it happened and that somebody either told you or you 
fi gured it out. It’s not something you remember directly, right?
