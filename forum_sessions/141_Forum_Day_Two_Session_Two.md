Forum Day Two: Session Two

ERHARD
Watch out or we’re going to get too far ahead into The Forum.

In mapping this conversation onto an area of my life where I have a rich body of distinctions,
things like skiing or leading The Forum, or being with my kids. Looking at my kids’ develop-
ment. It seems like there are three things in the conversation for distinguishing distinction. I
wanted to see if I’m tracking with it. One is that it’s almost entirely in what is unsaid. What’s
said is almost only because something needs to be said for there to be an unsaid.  The second is
that action is a necessary component.
ERHARD
Yeah, that would be misunderstood at this point. You can have an action in language too.

The spoken conversation doesn’t necessarily need to be about what’s being distinguished.
ERHARD
That’s right. That’s what I read from Heidegger about leaving it the realm of the unsaid. Like in
the Karate Kid.

I had participation as a defi nition, and it shifted over to a distinction. I started to listen diff erent-
ly. When you talked about being used by a distinction, two things happened. I recalled a movie I
saw called The Gods Must Be Crazy. There was no Coke bottle for them, but I get that there was
no not-Coke bottle for me. I’m here for a breakthrough in my commitment in my relationship
with my children and my wife. I’ve used up the context for my family.
ERHARD
Listen up here. You create a possibility for your family and when you use up that possibility,
and wonder where the juice went: What’s missing may not be more and better content. What’s
missing may be a new opening, a new possibility.

And I could see that the conversation for extending the single dimension. There’s a new demand
for myself for generating distinction.
ERHARD
Something extraordinary opens up with a new realm of distinction. It’s not additive. It’s unrelat-
ed to what it was before. No persistence of the old.

So now this isn’t news—the power of distinction—see I had that as a defi nition distinct from
HEIDEGGER’S PEDAGOGY
Here, despite the aff inities we are proposing between the thinking
of Heidegger and the work of Werner Erhard, we call attention to a
fundamental diff erence in the nature of their work. This diff erence
lies in the rhetorical form of their communication. In The Forum, the
model is not orator and audience, a commonplace view of rhetoric.
Rather, The Forum’s form, elements of which have emerged in the
various perspectives expressed in this book, is rhetorical dialogue, a
strategic transaction which has as its aim the inclusion of the dialogic
participants in the disclosive experience itself. Preservation, in this
model, stands in a diff erent relationship to disclosure: it becomes the
dwelling-within the work by those who have themselves participated
in the disclosive and creative act of communication.

SPEAKING BEING
distinguishing distinction. And then I saw that there’s a particular relationship that I’ve adopted.
I don’t see the incident, but I’ve got an already always listening, a new one I hadn’t seen before:
“this is theirs, not mine.” I can see now that’s been using my life. There’s an opening.
ERHARD
When you can see “it’s theirs, not mine,” then there’s a possibility beyond “it’s theirs, not mine.”
When you keep avoiding it, there is no possibility.
KYLE
What is the diff erence between diff erence and distinction?
ERHARD
Distinction is not dependent upon relationship, and diff erence is. Something that’s diff erent
is dependent upon that from which it is diff erent. I don’t see photons, I see people, although
what’s out there are photons. I don’t see with my eyes. I see with my mouth. That is to say, I
see with language. Things occur as they occur because of language. What distinguishing is, is
to take something like an undiff erentiated mass and to bring forth from that mass a realm of
possibility. Distinction gives existence. It makes existence possible. Distinctions aren’t depen-
dent on. They are kind of, of themselves. The eff ectiveness of someone who can deal from the
whole—and all that means is having the distinction—is very diff erent from someone who has
all the parts.
(Kyle sits down)
Why we had this whole discussion: so we can distinguish racket—so your racket occurs for
you as a racket. So that you’re not looking around for what fi ts the defi nition. I want it to show
up for you as a presence. I’m going to distinguish a racket. A racket’s got to be something that
you’re protesting, saying you don’t want to be doing or being. Something you wish you weren’t
doing, or trying not to do it. Like let’s say you’re being stupid. It’s not a racket if you say listen,
I’m being stupid on purpose, I get a lot out of being stupid. See when I’m stupid I don’t have to
be responsible for anything. That’s not a racket. A racket is where you are like, “I wish I wasn’t
so stupid!” That’s when it’s a racket. A racket has got to be something you’re doing or being that
you are protesting or resisting or that you don’t want to do or be. That’s what makes it a racket.
And what’s driving it is the payoff . You’re getting something out of being stupid—that’s your
racket. Like, “my family walks all over me, and I don’t want them to do that.” There’s a protest
there. Then what’s the payoff ? I get to feel sorry for myself. “Oh I see: that’s a racket.” What’s
driving you to be a way that your family walks all over you is the payoff  you get for having your
family walk all over you. And then there’s a cost. There are three elements to a racket. You’re
doing or being something that you’re protesting or resisting, but you’re still doing it. It’s persist-
ing and you’re protesting the persistence. The second element is the payoff . It’s the payoff  which
drives the racket. Rackets are not habits. Take the payoff  away, the racket disappears immediate-
ly. Being cranky is not a habit. Brushing your teeth is a habit. Pull all your teeth out, you’d brush
your teeth about three days. The payoff s are invariant and the costs are also always the same.
Someone give me an example.
The scholar John Anderson has observed that throughout his
work, Martin Heidegger is “urging his hearers and readers toward
a kind of transmutation of themselves. . .” (DT 12). Ronald Bruzina
locates this transmutation in a surrender to the direction of Heide-
gger’s thinking:
Heidegger is not attempting to formulate a
position, but rather to execute a movement. If
we realize now that this “movement” he exe-
cutes is not only always in language, but also
in a highly original and strange kind of word-
ing, then we are close to seeing that this very
immersion in a wording movement constitutes
thinking. (Ronald Bruzina, “Heidegger on the
Metaphor and Philosophy” 197)
“
Heidegger himself claimed that this direction of movement
requires a transformation, which “occurs as a passage. . . in which
one site is left  behind in favor of another. . . and that requires that
the sites be placed in discussion” (“DL” in OWL 42).
The critical element in this process was the passage. This point
was made again at the beginning of the lecture series later published
as On Time and Being, when Heidegger instructed his students on
the way of listening they should bring to the lectures in order that the
intended transformation might be achieved: “Let me give a little hint
on how to listen,” he said. “The point is not to listen to a series of prop-
ositions, but rather to follow the movement of showing” (OTB 2).
At the same time, Heidegger recognized the limitations of the
lecture format for achieving the transformation he sought. In con-
cluding this same lecture series, he acknowledged that “the form of a
lecture remains itself an obstacle. . . . The lecture has spoken merely in
propositional statements” (OTB 24). Neither, he suggested elsewhere,
is a “scientific dissertation” an appropriate medium for an inquiry into
language and Being, since “the movement of the questioning that is
called for here might too easily congeal” (“DL” in OWL 50, emphasis
added). Nor, he added, can “a transformation” be “established as the
consequence of an accumulation of the results of philosophical re-
search” (“DL” in OWL 42). For Heidegger as for Erhard, transformation
was a gestalt switch from one site of understanding to another, a leap.
