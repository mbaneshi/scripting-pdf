Forum Day Four: Session Two

without saying anything, or directly about it, that I felt more intimate with the people that were
sharing in the group and that emotions were starting to well right up out of me. And I know I
can take that and be reasonable and say “Oh, that’s great, I’ll do this now all the time and I’ll
have these emotions and everything will be fi xed.” And hey, I’m feeling it.
KIPP
When you do.
BARRY
I am right now. I may not tonight or I may not tomorrow. Now I am.
KIPP
You always will when you do.
BARRY
I’m there.
KIPP
Thank you very much.
(applause)
So, we’re distinguishing this distinction called reasonableness. Is it so that in life you either
have the results or the reasons for not having them? And is it also so that as a human being, the
way it is to be a human being, is if you give yourself a suffi  cient reason that you also give equal
weight to that? That’s enough reason for not having this result. So if the result doesn’t occur,
where do you immediately look? At the reason why it didn’t. So we’re asking where in your life
do you have reasons for not participating. Please...
SANFORD
Well, sharing is one of them. For the fi rst day and a half in here I was sitting on a lot of shares,
I had lots of reasons, you know, the golden share, the whole bit. So now I have reasons for
sharing, so there’s really no way of getting away from either one. But beyond that, I’ve had
reasons for not choosing a career, for not living into the full possibility of what life could be for
me. Reasons for not keeping promises—made some promises to people back in Seattle about
being in communication with people in The Forum about various things around the work, and
just everywhere, everywhere I look. There are reasons for doing things and not doing it. When I
produce results I have reasons for getting the results. If I don’t get the results I have reasons for
not getting them, but if I get results I have reasons for getting them.
KIPP
Okay. Anything else?
truth except from a perspective beyond that truth, and that perspec-
tive must be created and discovered for oneself as one lives within
the rhetorical dialogue of The Forum as it unfolds. Participants of The
Forum are called, again and again, to stand in another perspective
given by a level of truth altogether diff erent from the level from
which life is ordinarily understood—as story, as Aletheia 3. However,
when someone speaks Being, names the primordial clearing that we
are, it can only be done at the level of “you do what you do and you
don’t do what you don’t do.” The continuing creation and expan-
sion of this perspective—of unconcealment—is the work of Werner
Erhard since the inception of the est Training.
t
But how does this unconcealment happen in The Forum?
We call attention to the environment of authenticity that has
been created in The Forum room over the past three days—first,
through disclosing the fundamental inauthenticity of human
beings through the discursive acts of distinguishing story and
what happened, racket, and so on; second, through disclosing
sharing as a particular way of communicating; and third, through
the authentic sharing itself that has emerged in the participants’
interactions with Erhard and the other Forum leaders.
In this environment, a new level of unconcealment becomes
possible as stories begin to be heard as stories—even by the indi-
viduals telling them, those whose lives have been shaped and lim-
ited by the “truth” of their stories. Too angry and afraid to reveal
it, Marsha had maintained the deception of having it all together,
which began to “make her thin”; Angel decided as a child that she
would be the most caring person in the world as a way to over-
come her fear of not really caring at all; Mike became stupid and in
need of the help of others as a response to experiencing himself as
incompetent; Jane hides out to avoid experiencing the embarrass-
ment of rejection due to being worthless. These are disclosures,
openings only possible from a point of view from which story and
what happened are distinct and uncollapsed. Thus, as the shaping
power of the stories begins to waver, the presence of the underly-
ing circumstances emerges with a new clarity; simultaneously, a
new freedom to be emerges.

SPEAKING BEING
SANFORD
Yeah. The question was reasons for not participating. I have a lot of reasons for not participating
in the assisting program.
KIPP
Everybody know he’s referring to the people who have been running microphones and man-
aging this entire program? Those are assistants in a program. You’ll have an opportunity to
acknowledge them later. Thank you. Go ahead.
SANFORD
So, I’m not sure there’s a lot of value going into what those reasons are, but the cost of having
those reasons instead of assisting is that, number one, I don’t have available to me whatever
would be there for me out of assisting and I’m ripping everybody else off  from what I could
contribute by doing that.
KIPP
Yeah. What you’ve got is your reasons.
SANFORD
Yeah. And if I continue to indulge myself in that, at the end of my life that’s what I’ll have is all
the reasons for what I did and what I didn’t do instead of powerful results.
KIPP
And that’s what most people got.
SANFORD
Yeah. Probably what everybody’s got; possibly what everybody’s got.
KIPP
Yeah, well, you talk to a lot of people and pretty much this is what people tell you about their
life: “I would have, if...”
f
SANFORD
Yeah, that’s my story for sure.
KIPP
Sanford, thank you. Anabeth?

The reasons for not participating go back a long way. So I can see that now. Earlier when Werner
was talking about when we were six or fi ve or four, whenever that happened, and my reaction
Fallenness
Nevertheless, stories have power. The meaningfulness of these
interpretations has provided the practical understanding by which
we have coped with the circumstances in our lives. As Erhard puts
it in Session Three of Day Four, our actions are always in a dance
with the way the world occurs. But while we remain immersed in
the oblivion of Aletheia 3, the dance is inauthentic. We do not own
the reality we are living because we have not chosen it; nor have
we chosen not to choose it. We have merely fallen into the drift
t
of the dance that has been thrown-open for us; and rather than
confront the situation, we flee into the tranquillizing distractions
of the “they.”
The inevitable forgetfulness of the “they” self—the forget-
ting of Being that follows the unconcealment of one’s story as a
story—is what Heidegger termed “fallenness.” Thomas Sheehan
in Making Sense of Heidegger writes that fallenness is a kind of
r
forgetting that results from focusing on what is meaningful to
us: “the more I focus on the meaningful, the more I forget that I
am the thrown-open clearing that makes meaning possible and
necessary” (116): we forget Aletheia 1 and Aletheia 2 and devolve
to the order of truth given by fallenness, that is, by Aletheia 3.
The conversation of The Forum is designed to bring the partici-
pants to Nothing, the thrown-open clearing of Aletheia 1, which is
possible only through undergoing the experience of the dialogue
for oneself as it moves backwards from truth as Aletheia 3 to
Aletheia 2, which already brings to presence Aletheia 1. Again and
again and again.
For instance, during his conversation with Jodie during Ses-
sion Two of Day Two, Erhard brought Jodie and all the participants
to think and
k
experience for themselves these three levels. To Jodie’s
recognition of her story as a story—that boys did not like her when
she was a little girl—Erhard said, “a story is just a story”—a point of
view of Aletheia 3 only granted us when “standing in” or “coming
from” Aletheia 2. When Erhard continues to say that “The ‘what
happened’ is what’s true or not. It did or it didn’t,” he is speaking
from the point of view of the thrown-open clearing given by Ale-
theia 1 as it regards Aletheia 2 and Aletheia 3. Erhard continued:
