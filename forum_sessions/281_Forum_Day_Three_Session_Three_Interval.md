Forum Day Three: Session Three Interval

“
[B]ecause the meaning of a word is determined by its web of
relations to other words as embedded in a set of linguistic
practices, and because humans are, as the Greeks saw, the
“language animal” (zoon logon echon),
n there is no way to
suppose that humans first existed and then later invented
first one word, then another, and so on. To see how language
emerged, then, we need to make use of something like Witt-
genstein’s metaphor, “Light dawns gradually over the whole.”
This image of a dawning light seems to be what is implied by
Heidegger’s descriptions of the originary struggle that is prior
to the appearance of humans and their explicit acts of naming.

Heidegger might put it this way: just as the modern era is the technological age,
in which human being is enframed in the service of technological devices, the age
of the Pre-Socratics was the age of the dawning light, when for a brief historical
moment a full experience of Being was made available to human Being-in-the-
world.
The struggle for the Greeks, then, was to seize this moment, individuating
beings into their meaningful places in the world while at the same time retaining
their essential relation to the sway, and thus their fundamental orientation to Being.
For Heidegger, the greatness of the Pre-Socratics consisted in their recognition of
this challenge, and its articulation in their thinking. At the same time, the promise of
this achievement for Western thinking has been lost. As we proceed in this series of
intervals on the forgetting of Being, we will consider further the nature of this loss.

SPEAKING BEING
The Forum resumed at 10 pm, following the dinner break. The four TV monitors located at
various points in the room have been turned on, so that the participants now have the option of
watching the action on the monitors rather than directly. Erhard and Kipp began by interacting
with participants’ sharing.
KIPP
Who would like to share what’s happening?
ANDY
I had a terrifi c time at dinner. And anything beyond “I’m here and I speak” is a joke. Well yeah
because, nothing. It’s great.
KIPP
When it is.
ANDY
Yeah.
KIPP
When it’s great it’s great, when it’s not it’s not. Thank you very much.
DON
I basically got tired of listening to people’s shit. A lot of the observation I made was people fell
back into story telling. And I stopped listening. I didn’t enjoy it.
KIPP
Okay.
DON
I didn’t enjoy that at all.
KIPP
So what?
DON
Well, yeah, right. I just like the meat and potatoes. That good stuff .
KIPP
But so what? You’ve got it that it should be some way.
DON
Right.
