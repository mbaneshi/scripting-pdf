Jargon
Erhard’s influence on the language of Western culture has been significant. His
terminology, like Heidegger’s, has always been unusual and highly purposive, and
many of these words and phrases made their way into the public sphere, some to
lasting effect. But that language, in its casual use, began to lose its power. Heidegger
detailed this process of devolution in Being and Time:
SESSION FOUR INTERVAL
I hardly use the word “transformation” at all any more. . . . because
while it once was a word that people had to think about, struggle
to grasp, work on, that’s just not true anymore. The word no longer
wakes people up. Now, when you say “transformation,” the word
puts them to sleep—like they know what it means—they stop
thinking, looking, inquiring.
Instead, he said, as his ontological inquiry has developed, “the notions keep getting
said differently” (Simon, “Quarterbacks and Coaches: Tossing It Around with Werner
Erhard,” Family Therapy Networker, March–April 1986, 30–39).
Heidegger addressed his own confrontation with this situation in his essay “A
Dialogue on Language,” a transcript of his conversation with a Japanese scholar. At
one point Heidegger (referred to in the transcript as the Inquirer) mentions two of
the ideas that were central in his early work, hermeneutics and phenomenology.

SPEAKING BEING
In the language which is spoken when one expresses oneself, there
lies an average intelligibility; and in accordance with this intelligi-
bility the discourse which is communicated can be understood to a
considerable extent, even if the hearer does not bring himself into
such a kind of Being towards what the discourse is about as to have
a primordial understanding of it. We do not so much understand
the entities which are talked about; we already are listening only to
what-is-said-in-the-talk as such. What is said in the talk gets under-
stood; but what the talk is about is understood only approximately
and superficially. . . . Idle talk is the possibility of understanding
everything without previously making the thing one’s own. . . . Thus,
by its very nature, idle talk is a closing-off , since to go back to the
ground of what is talked about is something which it leaves undone.
(BT 212–213)
“
Erhard’s comments in a 1986 interview, discussing the evolution of his own
language use, echo Heidegger’s account of the process by which terms lose their
originative power. Many of the words he had used in his work, Erhard said, “even-
tually drifted into popular use.” They “lost the creative intention behind them and
degenerated into a kind of jargon.” Outside their original context, as Heidegger put
it, the terms no longer reached out into the “totality of involvements” in which their
significance was grounded (BT 200).
This was the fate of the term “transformation,” a central term to which Erhard
had assigned “an extremely precise meaning.” Today, he said, “you hear it every-
where. You read about it in business journals. It’s ‘hot.’ So, to some degree, it’s lost
its potency.” He continued:
[Japanese]: I am all the more puzzled that you have meanwhile
dropped both words.
[Inquirer]: That was done, not—as is so oft en thought—in order to
deny the significance of phenomenology, but in order to abandon
my own path of thinking to namelessness.
[Japanese]: An eff ort with which you will hardly be successful. . . .
[Inquirer]: . . . since one cannot get by in public without rubrics.

“
What is essential in both Heidegger’s work and Erhard’s is what is unspoken and
therefore essentially nameless. Much of Erhard’s work during the four decades of its
evolution may be seen as the development of new rubrics (distinctions) to replace
those that have devolved into jargon, such that what is said makes present what
cannot be said in words.

SPEAKING BEING
The Forum resumed at 10:30 pm. Erhard began by inviting questions from the
participants. One participant, reviewing The Forum, shared that his already always
listening had altered as a result of that experience.
ERHARD (addressing the group)
He’s got a possibility beyond his thrown listening. He got it by owning his
thrown listening. There’s something called getting off  it. This is a sacred thing.
To get off  it is sacred. Now, what does getting off  it mean? It means he’s not
constrained to entertain that listening. He can hear himself listening and get
off  that listening. When his already always listening comes up, he is able to
own it, to embrace it, to be responsible for it. In the normal course of events,
if I found out my already always listening was disempowering I would try to
stop it. He didn’t change it. That’s the big secret. Because when you change it,
nothing changes.
(shifting tone)
This is a “you-gotta-get-this.” So listen up.
At the chalkboard, Erhard placed the chalk on the surface and moved it, so that
the chalk ended in a diff erent place but a line remained indicating the path of its
movement.
ERHARD (continuing)
Change persists. When you’re diff erent, what persists? That which you’re dif-
ferent than. So when you’re diff erent you’re the same, because the thing from
which you’re diff erent is still there. The more diff erence, the more persistence.
If you’re really diff erent, the thing you’re diff erent than has a big persistence.
If I’m a nice guy as a solution to a problem, the problem for which being a nice
guy is a solution stays in place. About ninety-nine percent of what you are,
you became as a solution to a problem. Education is a solution to being stupid.
When you solve a problem, what persists is the problem.
(to the participant)
So your listening that altered hadn’t solved the problem of your already always
listening.
(to the group)
He had embraced it. He was able to be with the problem.

the same space—the space between them—and they will disappear. Anything
you can let be will let you be. There are no accidents of being. You’ve got to be
there for it, open for it, available for it.
DAVID
I wanted to recognize that I haven’t really been listening.
ERHARD
Recognition is the beginning. When you recognize your own already always
listening, you’re on the fi eld. The game’s not over, but you’re on the fi eld.
DAVID
What do I do with my realization?
ERHARD
Nothing. It’ll do something with you. It’ll give you something you didn’t have
before. Most of you ought to be able to map what David said onto your own
listening.
Here Erhard called Kipp to the platform to conduct the next exercise; Erhard
remained nearby, interrupting occasionally to reinforce a point.
KIPP (to the group)
Your job is to sit in your chair, and when I say “now,” describe to yourself
whatever’s happening right now.
(pausing)
Now.
(a minute of silence)
Okay, plenty of data. Let’s have a few people report what they are experiencing
now.
PARTICIPANT
I’m bored and I don’t want to be here.
PARTICIPANT
I’m analyzing a lot.
ERHARD
It’s not you analyzing, it’s it analyzing, because you can’t stop it.
t
PARTICIPANT
What am I supposed to do now?
Forum Day One: Session Five
81
PARTICIPANT
I noticed I was really exhausted.
KIPP
So what you just did was unconceal a fundamental condition that human
beings are. I asked you to sit in your chair and think about what’s happening
right now, and what did you do? By the time you get around to describing
what’s happening right now, it’s gone. Yet everybody stood up authentically,
honestly, and described what happened then but said it was what is now.
There’s no description available for now. So you’ve got to have the representa-
tion. But what’s present is clearly distinct from the representation. And what it
is to be a human being is not to have that distinction. This is what happened at
the party before you got here. The domains of presence and representation got
collapsed. The moment you say what was happening is what is happening, the
representation starts to shape the presence.
ERHARD
What’s the diff erence between now and your representation of now? You
can never describe presence because there’s no description in the realm of
presence. If this isn’t making sense, don’t worry. The valuable stuff  in here
will not make sense. But it’s valid. “Make sense” means “fi ts with what you
already know.” To get what doesn’t make sense requires thinking. What Kipp
is trying to get you to get is that you don’t make any distinction between love
as a presence and love as a story. Is there anybody in the room who can’t see
that existence as a presence is diff erent from existence as a concept or repre-
sentation?
(pausing)
Life exists in the world of concepts and life exists in the world of presence.
But that’s misleading, because the two get collapsed. Something happens,
like a “what happened.” And that devolves into a concept. What happened
back then is never present like a presence. But that’s not clear to you. You
think you’re dealing with what happened when what you’re really dealing
with is your story about what happened. One is not better than the other.
The problem is when they get mixed together. This creates a vicious circle:
the concept of your previous experience now becomes a fi lter for your next
experience, which is now a little less free because it is conceptually shaped.
The conceptually shaped experience reinforces the concept; the reinforced
concept more fully shapes the experience. I’m trying to drive out this seven-
ties bullshit that there’s something wrong with your head. I’m an anti-human
potentialist. I’m not saying that you’re stuck in the concept. I’m saying that
you’re stuck in the vicious circle. I don’t want questions. I want to know:
“Did you get that?”
(pausing)
Good. Everybody got that. So now we’re going to demonstrate what happens
when you’ve got that distinction. Once you get a distinction, it uses you. Three
distinctions to get: one is the realm of existence called presence. The second is
the realm of existence called concept or representation. The third is the vicious
circle. The vicious circle is constructed by a collapse of the fi rst two domains.
(pausing)
We’re going to play a new game. We’re going to do a survey. How many of you
are tired?
(a majority of participants raised their hands)
How many of you have a headache?
(calling on a young woman named Diane)
Would you be willing to participate in a demonstration? Then please come up
here onto the platform.
Diane sat in the second director’s chair that an assistant placed alongside the fi rst.
ERHARD
Would you be willing to have your headache disappear?
DIANE
Yes.
ERHARD
And would you be willing to not know why it disappeared?
DIANE
Okay.
ERHARD
Please close your eyes. How long have you had your headache?
DIANE
Since before the dinner break.
ERHARD
How big is it?
(hesitating, she holds hands outstretched)
Where is it located?
(pointing to her left temple)
What color is it?

DIANE (hesitating)
Brown.
ERHARD
If it had a geometric shape, what would it be?
DIANE
Triangular.
ERHARD
How much water would it hold?
DIANE
About a pint.
ERHARD
On a scale of one to ten, where is it?
DIANE
Six and a half.
ERHARD
Why do you have it?
DIANE
Because it’s been a long day.
ERHARD
Headache and long day live in diff erent realms. You have collapsed them. So,
why do you have a headache?
DIANE
Because I’ve been sitting still.
ERHARD
So you’ve got two domains collapsed. Every time I ask you that stupid question
“Why?” it collapses the two domains.
(repeating this series of questions several times)
How’s your headache now?
DIANE
It’s a four.
ERHARD
How much water would it hold?
DIANE
Still a pint.
ERHARD
It’s critically important that you get it. The headache now and the headache
a moment ago are collapsed together. When she says the headache is “still” a
pint, I know she has collapsed the headache now with the representation of
the headache then.
(continuing to question her regarding the headache’s shape, color and location
right now)
Do you have a headache?
DIANE
No, I don’t.
ERHARD (to the group)
What happened was, I asked her questions which in order to answer she had
to be in the presence of her headache like a presence.
DIANE
I focused on it.
ERHARD
No! What happened was you got the domains uncollapsed. All that happened
was that the headache, instead of showing up in the vicious circle, showed up
distinct in the domain of presence. You looked at your headache. You were
present to the headache. There are no reasons when the headache is like a
presence.
A second demonstration followed with Patricia, a participant who said she was
tired. She sat in one of the director’s chairs; Erhard sat on the arm of his, facing
her.
ERHARD
How tired are you on a scale from one to ten?

PATRICIA
Three.
ERHARD
Good. We’re going to leave you at three.
(returning to her seat as the group applauded)
For how many people in the room is something starting to move?
(many hands raising)
For how many people in the room is nothing starting to move?
(more hands)
How many people are at maybe, can’t tell?
(still more hands)
You know where you should be? Where you are?
(pausing)
I’m going to give you an assignment which will determine how much you get
out of The Forum. I got your money. I can’t lose. You can lose. The point is:
you have a chance to enhance what you get out of here. Bring your life in here
tomorrow. Don’t bring the face you brought today—the “I’ve got it all togeth-
er” face. Bring in the face that’s authentic about your own inauthenticity.
What has it cost you in life to collapse those domains? What you’re bringing in
tomorrow is your inauthenticity.
(pausing)
We didn’t talk about looking good today, did we? We’re going to do it in
thirty seconds. You have a major concern for looking good. For some people
looking bad is looking good. So when you come in tomorrow, be able to
talk about where in your life are you used by looking good. Looking good
owns your life.
(pausing)
The four-day format of this Forum is both an asset and a liability. The
liability is that there aren’t five days between the weekends for you to be
back in your lives and talk about your experience. You have got to commu-
nicate what’s happening for you here. You have got to be articulate in this
conversation. Tonight you’ve got to talk about this to other people. You’ve
got to begin to be able to generate the conversation. You’ve got to be able to
speak this. You don’t have to explain it. You want to be in communication
about this like an experience, like a presence. I know a lot of people who
understand this and don’t live it.
PARTICIPANT
It is very late and I am tired.
PATRICIA
A four.
ERHARD
Do you know why you are tired? Notice I didn’t ask you “do you think you
k
know why?” I asked if you know why you’re tired.
PATRICIA
No.
ERHARD
What’s the relationship between the reasons you have for being tired and
being tired? There isn’t any. The reasons are valid. In other words, in the world
of reasons every reason you have is a valid reason. You don’t have any nutty
reasons.
(turning to the group and speaking in a loud voice)
There’s no such thing as tired! That’s a concept!
(back to Patricia)
Where in your body are you experiencing what you used to call being tired?
PATRICIA
My arms.
ERHARD
And where else in your body?
As Erhard repeated the question, she responded each time by identifying a tired
area of her body.
ERHARD
Nothing much conceptual about this, is there? It’s all presence.
PATRICIA
My arms are still tired.
ERHARD
For a while there you were really looking. But then you got to thinking
about it. Whenever you say “still” or “also”... See how easy it is to collapse
the domains?
(continuing to question her)
You were at a four when you started this. Where are you now?

ERHARD
Do you think I give a shit that you’re tired? We’re talking about the rest of your
life and you’re sitting there complaining about being tired. That’s disgusting.
You are disgusting.

Now that I’ve got your attention. . .
(repeating the assignments)
Let me leave you with a reminder. I have already gotten everything I need out
of this Forum. You have not. You need to be twice as powerful tomorrow. The
way to be twice as powerful is to do these assignments. You gave your word
to be here on time tomorrow. Is that clear? You gave your word to be on time
tomorrow regardless of the circumstances, is that clear?
(to a participant who was standing at the back of the room preparing to leave)
What are you doing at the door with your hat and coat on? You need to be
back in The Forum so we can end The Forum.
The participant returned to her seat in palpable silence.
ERHARD
Thank you.

SPEAKING BEING
the circumstances. There are also moments when we experience freedom from
self-awareness. The diff erence between these two states is relevant to our inquiry
here. Where does the self live when it is not alive in our awareness?
This leads to the second point made here by Heidegger, one which is generally less
apparent than the first: self-reflection is at the same time self-production: “The essential
thing is ‘I will myself’” (EP 64). The human self is not like the human elbow: it is not a
P
ready-made part of the package that accompanies an infant’s arrival in the world. What
is included in the package, although not immediately functional, is language, which pro-
vides the material with which we are eventually able to produce a self. But in a world of
beings with selves, questions about the nature and stability of the self arise persistently,
and recent advances in the study of the human brain, as well as child development, have
informed the inquiry but have not answered the questions. Therefore we note the point
here as a question to be kept open as The Forum proceeds.
Regarding the phenomenon of reflexion, Heidegger says further that it is “Man’s
settling down in one of his essential places,” and he notes with emphasis that it is
characterized by “certainty, certainty” (EP 60). That is, for the most part, human
P
beings are made both secure and comfortable by the condition that their self-knowl-
edge provides. While many of us spend considerable time tinkering with the details
of our identities in the interest of self-improvement, on the whole those identities
give us security. On the whole, we are at home in ourselves.
This, at least, is the way of things in the current paradigm. This interpretation
of the self, however, while self-evident to most of us, is an artifact of a particular way
t
of understanding human being. Indeed, it has been the dominant understanding for
several centuries; and while it is increasingly questioned among people who think
actively about these matters, such as philosophers and other scholars, it remains
the operative understanding for most people in the world—not as something they
bring to mind, or could articulate, but as a way of functioning in their everyday lives.
This particular way of understanding the world, and our place in it, is generally
known as the Cartesian paradigm. It is so called in recognition of the man in whose
thinking the model was crystallized, the seventeenth-century French philosopher
and mathematician Rene Descartes. As a philosopher, Descartes’ job was to engage
in thought experiments; and in one of those experiments—which turned out to be
significant for all of us—he decided that he would place everything in the world in
doubt. His purpose in doing this was to discover what, if anything, was indubitable:
what in the world, in the face of committed skepticism, could retain a quality of
absolute certainty?
END OF DAY ONE INTERVAL
Reflexion: The Cartesian Deficiency
At the outset of Being and Time, Martin Heidegger makes a point that might other-
wise be dismissed as obvious: any inquiry into the nature of Being—such as Werner
Erhard’s project, or Heidegger’s own—must always be conducted by human beings,
who as far as we can tell are the only beings who have a concern for the matter, as
well as the only ones who are capable of inquiring. Humans are therefore involved
at multiple points in the inquiry—as the beings who are questioning, as the beings of
whom the question is asked, and as the beings about whom the question is asked.
t
This point is important because of its implications for the inquiry: it will be char-
acterized throughout by reflexion. Reflexion, or self-referentiality, is an important
idea in the work of both Heidegger and Erhard. The term designates a state in which
we are turned toward our selves, as when confronting a reflection.
d
Reflexion requires, first of all, self-consciousness. To say that human beings are
the only beings for whom their being is an issue, is to say that human beings are the
only beings who are self-conscious—or, to say it more simply, we are the only beings
who have a self. While the consciousness of other animals is likely always to remain
a mystery at some level, it is generally agreed that dogs do not reflect upon their
existence. Here, Heidegger emphasizes the centrality of such reflection to human
awareness:
Consciousness is self-consciousness, and self-consciousness
is ego-consciousness or “we”-consciousness. The essential
thing in this is the re-flexive, and in it the “I,” “we,” “self,”
the presentation-to-self and self-production. (EP 64)
P
“
Two points in this passage should be noted. The first, like many points that
arise in an ontological inquiry, can seem at first both apparent and trivial: one’s
consciousness always includes consciousness of one’s self. That is, in being aware
of my world, I am always at some level aware of my self as the center of my aware-
ness. It is worth taking a moment to notice this, because the nature of the self, and
the quality of its presence in human awareness, will become a central topic as The
Forum proceeds. Clearly, there are moments in life when one’s self-consciousness
becomes intensified, resulting in either pleasure or discomfort, depending upon
Forum Day One: End of Day One Interval 87
The outcome of this experiment led him to the formulation that has come
down to us as his most famous statement, one familiar to almost every university
undergraduate although generally without a clear idea of its implications: I think,
therefore I am (or in Descartes’ original Latin, Cogito, ergo sum).
That is: if I doubt everything, the only thing of which I can be certain is that I
am the doubter. I can know nothing with certainty except myself, as the one who
is thinking. Further, since I am the only certainty, I am also the inevitable arbiter of
what counts as real. In the Cartesian model of human being that emerged from this
experiment—the model that today we inhabit unthinkingly—the cogito, the “I,” the
being who thinks, is the grounding certainty at the center of things. It is the subject
(Latin subjectum, what lies beneath), while out there, independent of the subject, is a
world of objects (objectum, over against). For humans, Being-in-the-world demands
that we determine the true meanings of those objects. Heidegger scholar Michael E.
Zimmerman describes the situation this way:
Although Copernicus had only recently shattered man’s
illusions about being the center of the physical universe,
Descartes established man as the ontological center:
l
henceforth, the reality of the real was what man asserted it
to be. . . . “To be” meant to be conceived by and through the
subject. . . . Everything got determined and evaluated from
the standpoint of man. (“Beyond ‘Humanism’: Heidegger’s
Understanding of Technology” 222)
It is this paradigm, of the fixed and self-certain human subject, that both Heide-
gger and Erhard are placing in question through their work. As Heidegger points out,
Descartes arrived at his conclusion by accepting as given the nature of the sum—
Being, the “I am.” But Heidegger proposes that the nature of “I am” has never been
fully worked out in the history of Western philosophy, so that behind Descartes’ con-
clusion “there lies hidden a failure to master the basic problem of Being” (BT 127).
T
The Cartesian model itself was the result of an experiment in reflexive thinking.
The heart of the subject–object distinction is “I think something” (EP 62) a premise
P
that turns thinking back upon itself, toward the “I,” and thus toward “the presenta-
tion-to-self and self-production” (EP 64). Presentation demands production, since
the “I” is not there to be reflected upon. In reflecting upon my self, I create my self.
“
But in the Cartesian model, the subject is self-certain—that is, certain of itself
as an entity that persists. The clearing for creation has been occupied. Therefore
Heidegger proposes that self-consciousness, which has in Descartes’ model bent
back far enough to see its “I,” must now bend back further and confront the context
in which the “I” stands essentially, a context that puts its self’s certainty in question.
As we will show, the culminating event of The Forum—the unconcealment of
Being—is accomplished through the evocation of a profound bending-back, reveal-
ing not only the context of the “I,” but in a masterful moment of existential rug-pull-
ing, the context of that context as well.
