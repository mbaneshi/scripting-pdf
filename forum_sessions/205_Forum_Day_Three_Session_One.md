Forum Day Three: Session One
191
JANE
Yes.
Erhard stood very close to Jane at this point, his tone intimate.
ERHARD
Because it’s something you do and something you are that you wish wasn’t so.
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
What’s the payoff  for hiding? Does hiding make you right that people don’t like you? It makes
you right about the fact that you’re not something to be liked.
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
Who does it make wrong?
JANE
Them.
ERHARD
Yeah. Because they don’t like you. And you don’t have to be responsible for relating; don’t have
to be dominated by relationship. Who you are is, “I’m not in the game.” Right?
JANE
Right.
ERHARD
How does it have you dominate? It keeps people trying to get in, doesn’t it? People around you
are puppets trying to get in. They’re puppets dangling on the hand of your racket. Right?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Are you physically attractive?
JANE
No. I’m ugly inside.
through their manner of being makes everything depressing and
puts a damper on everything” (FCM 67). These attunements are
“not at all inside in some sort of soul of the Other,” nor are they out
there at hand in the world in some way (FCM 66).
Where and in what way are they, then?
“
In positive terms, attunement is a fundamental
manner, the fundamental way in which Dasein is
as Dasein. . . .  And precisely those attunements to
which we pay no heed at all, the attunements we
least observe, those attunements that attune us
in such a way that we feel as though there is no
attunement there at all, as though we were not
attuned in any way at all—these attunements are
the most powerful. (FCM 67–68)
M
In attunements, “we first meet ourselves—as being-there” (FCM
68). They shape our world, give us our ways of being, and provide
the context for our philosophizing. Heidegger says that the task
of philosophy is to “awaken” them in some sense, and then . . .
well, we correct the situation, of course. This is the usual human
impulse: fix the problem by altering or replacing the attunement.
Heidegger and Erhard, on the other hand, are proposing a
diff erent response, one distinguished throughout their thinking
and most importantly referred to by Heidegger as appropriation;
appropriation lets the situation be, distinguished as itself.
“
[A]wakening attunements is a manner and means
of grasping Da-sein with respect to the specific
‘way’ [Weise] in which it is, of grasping Da-sein as
Da-Sein, or better: of letting Da-sein be as it is, or
can be, as Da-sein. Such awakening may perhaps
be a strange undertaking, diff icult and scarcely
transparent. If we have understood our task, then
we must now see to it that we do not suddenly
start to deliberate about attunements again or
t
even about awakening, but inasmuch as this
t
awakening is an acting, we must act in accordance
t
with it. (FCM 68)

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
What’s the “ugly inside”?
JANE
My feelings.
ERHARD
Like worthless. Like being nobody.
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Do you know you made yourself “nobody”? At some point in your life something happened and you
became “I am worthless.” It’s not that you think it. It’s that you are it. It’s not that you are worthless
because you think you’re worthless. It’s the other way around. You are that you are “worthless” and
therefore you think it, and you see it, and you listen it, and you smell it, taste it and touch it. You’re
already always worthless. You’re worthless waiting to happen. Did you hear what I said?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Now, sometime today, or at the worst, tomorrow morning, you’re going to fi nd out about this
worthlessness business. But all I want you to get right now is that at some point in your life, something
happened, and you made yourself worthless. It’s not that you are naturally worthless. At some point
today you’re going to fi nd out what you are at the bottom, and it ain’t worthless. It’s something else.
You made “being worthless.” And you’re clear there’s a payoff  to being worthless, right?
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
What does it cost you to be worthless?
JANE
Love, happiness, self-expression.
ERHARD
Mostly self-expression. Look out there. Does it look diff erent?
JANE
Yes. Just people.
Therefore, early in The Forum, Erhard exhorted participants not
to try to fix anything they think is wrong with them, or to lose any
“moods” they think may get in their way. Attunements are us; they
are the raw material of The Forum.
Letting them be is diff icult and not as transparent as it
sounds.  ■
