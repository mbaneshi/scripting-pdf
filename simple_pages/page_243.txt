Forum Day Three: Session Three 229
ERHARD
I got over being upset. It not only doesn’t mean anything... 
(pausing)
Listen. Life is not only empty and meaningless, but it is empty and meaningless that it is empty 
and meaningless. See, some asshole in here is going to say, “Well, if it’s empty and meaningless 
then I’m going home.” 
(loudly) 
No! You made it mean something! You didn’t get it. It’s empty and meaningless and it’s empty 
and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless. Life’s not going anywhere. It’s like this. You 
don’t like this? Too bad. This is the way it is. Just like this, and that, and that. Tomorrow will be 
like it is tomorrow, and the day after will be like it is the day after tomorrow. And a year from 
now will be like it is a year from now: like it is today. A lot of you are hearing me insulting 
your practice. You know, insulting your practice, let’s call it, your relationship with God, your 
meditation, whatever it is. I’m not insulting your practice. I’m insulting practicing in-order-to. 
You practice when you practice. Shut up. Just practice. It’s not going to get you anywhere. If 
you’re practicing in order to get somewhere, stop it because you’re wasting your time. You’re 
not going to get anywhere. You’re always going to be right where you are. If you practice long 
enough, you’ll fi nd that out. Talk to Kipp some more, you’re doing a good job.
KIPP
Now what?
ANGEL
That’s a very good question.
ERHARD
Very good...
ANGEL
I like the fact that...
ERHARD
Remember when I said that you thought your fi re would go out if you didn’t have this drama? 
ANGEL
Right.
ERHARD
Yes.
ANGEL
But I got fi re from the possibility of having an empty canvas.
