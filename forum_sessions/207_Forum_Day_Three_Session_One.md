Forum Day Three: Session One
193
ERHARD
Stick around. It’s not over yet.
The Forum leader, Wes, now came onto the platform.  Erhard remained in the room.
WES
Good morning. We’re going to do the letters now. What do you think the purpose of this
assignment was? The results of The Forum are not something deep inside yourself. Here’s
what’s deep inside yourself: gunk, blood, undigested food. There’s no place deep inside yourself
where life’s really happening. It’s important to get this because you’ve got to know where The
Forum takes place to have The Forum be eff ective for you. You need to know where The Forum
occurs so you can have it occur powerfully. Okay, here’s the hard part: where does The
Forum occur?
(pointing to his mouth)
The Forum occurs right here. The Forum occurs in languaging. That’s where The Forum
occurs. It doesn’t occur where you thought it occurred. The Forum occurs in a conversation,
which becomes you, or it doesn’t. How do people keep getting results one to two years after The
Forum? Generating the conversation is how you make The Forum eff ective ongoingly. What
you want to master is what occurs in being able to say and listen what The Forum is. Ultimately,
The Forum occurs in your ability to say it—to say the possibility which it is. To those who didn’t
do the assignment, who didn’t write the letter: You blew it. Listen to what people share: You
could’ve gotten that.
A Japanese woman, Ayako, rose to share her letter addressed to one of her parents: she had come to
The Forum to make a career decision, but found herself discovering that her racket is “being nice,”
and that this was what was in the way. She stopped reading to explain to Wes the circumstances
behind her letter.
WES
You want your letter to be so clear it doesn’t need to be explained. You should’ve put that in
your letter.
AYAKO
I’m confused. I’m in the gap between living in the US and having a Japanese background.
WES
You don’t sound confused to me. You may be disempowering yourself to call it confusion. Not
knowing like a possibility may be a very powerful place to be in life. One of the most powerful
places to be in life is to let be “not knowing.”
(to the group)
I invite you to stop being confused.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (rejoining the conversation)
“I’m confused” is a racket; always only a racket. It’s a way of being from which you can survive
when you’re threatened. “I know that I don’t know” is an opening for enlightenment. Nothing
shows up in confusion. Confusion is a resistance to knowing, and it’s built on a resistance to not
knowing. Your resistance to not knowing produces this racket called being confused. Lots of the
time when I’m reading I have to read something over again because I don’t get it. But I’m not
confused. If I’m confused I put the book down and walk away. Not knowing is a very high state
of knowing. It’s the step next to knowing. But confusion is way down at the bottom. The state
before natural knowing is knowing that you don’t know. Confusion is a defense mechanism, not
an attempt to learn. It’s a defense mechanism against fear.
AYAKO
My sleepless nights disappeared the moment I signed up for The Forum.
WES
How many of you had something signifi cant happen out of enrolling?
(most people in the room raising their hands)
Why that happens: it was a commitment. Filling out the card, paying the money, created a
commitment. It’s a stand for something, which itself generates the results.
PARTICIPANT
What I’m in the presence of is the cost of trying to change my racket instead of having it.
WES
You always have a reason for everything. That’s what it is to be human. What displaces the
possibility of contributing or making a diff erence is identity.
PARTICIPANT
I was surprised that the person I chose to write the letter to was my mother—surprised that she
was the person who would understand—with all the stuff  I have going on.
WES
You notice her mother didn’t change. This shift in her relationship with her mother came
from a realization she had. When your racket is running your life, your life isn’t happening.
Something dead is happening, not living. When your racket is running your life, something is
thwarting life.
At this point Wes announced a break, and gave participants an assignment.
WES (continuing)
Two questions for the break: What is your fundamental point of view about life? What is the
fundamental point of view about life?
They adjourned for a break at 12:25.
“
Confusion is a resistance to knowing, and
it’s built on a resistance to not knowing.
Your resistance to not knowing produces
this racket called being confused.

the pre-Socratics because they survive only in fragments whose interpretation can
easily be skewed in a Heideggerian direction” (Polt 133).
But Gerald L. Bruns, in his study of Heidegger’s later writing, has suggested
that in his conversation with the ancient Greeks, Heidegger is musing on “a handful
of overtranslated words (physis, logos, moira, eris, aletheia, hen)” in order to
‘undertranslate’ these words, as if to preserve them in their darkness” (Heidegger’s
Estrangements 181). This means taking words in “a sense which is diff erent from
what is customary or established or used with reason; it is to take them in a sense
which is wandering or ambiguous in the manner of the word rather than fixed in the
manner of the term” (Heidegger’s Estrangements 181). Here we have wandered into
a traditional definition of rhetorical figures, both tropes and schemes, which serve
to turn us away from the common usage and meaning of sentences (schemes) and
words (tropes). Etymology is one such turning away from the current and common
to retrieve and make present what has been lost and dispersed; etymology is in
essence a form of punning that brings about a shift , an awakening to a sense distinct
from the obvious and everyday. Bruns writes that
“
Aft er all, an etymology is, rhetorically, a figure of speech that
consists of taking a familiar expression strangely, where the
strangeness takes the form of some repressed or forgotten
“original sense.” But of course there never was such a sense
in the sense of a time when etymology determined use. There
never was anything but idiom, that is, no time of pristine,
undisseminated (fixed) meaning. . . . To imagine a people
somewhere actually speaking etymologically is comic theatre
worthy of Jonathon Swift  or James Joyce—or Woody Allen.
(Gerald Bruns, Heidegger’s Estrangements 134–135)
While there is no “original” meaning of a word, the tendency to forget the constitutive
possibilities of language leaves us to assume there was a time of pristine and fixed
meaning from which we have devolved, and back to which the practice of etymology
might bring us. Thus, remembering our forgetfulness through etymological punning—if
we follow the movement of Heidegger’s figure—evokes the “strangeness” of what
appears to be an “original sense.”
John D. Caputo has proposed a similar justification for these etymologies:
Heidegger’s goal, says Caputo, is “to eff ect a ‘destruction,’ a shaking loose, of
Western philosophy in order to gain access to what is really being said in and by it.
The Forgetting of Being, Part Three of Eight: Heidegger's
Etymologies
Heidegger’s project may be seen as a reaction against the development of the
metaphysical tradition in Western thinking, and as a corresponding attempt to
think a way back to the greatness which was promised at the beginning of Western
philosophy. For Heidegger, a significant step in this thinking-back involves tracing
the etymologies of terms whose meanings emerged with the pre-Socratic Greek
thinkers, whose writings mostly exist as fragments. These meanings, and the path
of their development over the centuries, have critically influenced the way human
beings in Western cultures (and, increasingly, global cultures) experience their
world.
The meanings of these terms, Heidegger claims, took an unfortunate turn
early in their development, so that today, in our loss of an experience of Being, we
suff er the consequences of this devolution. Heidegger is forceful on this point: our
language, he says, is “worn out.” We must therefore “seek to win back intact the
naming force of language and words; for words and language are not just shells
into which things are packed for spoken and written intercourse. In the word, in
language, things first come to be and are” (IM 15).
In tracing this historical process, Heidegger has constructed what Richard
Polt describes as “a saga in which an original Greek experience of unconcealment
degenerated into a focus on correctness, with dire consequences for us all”
(Heidegger: An Introduction 133). Heidegger’s historical perspective on language,
and thus Being, is developed throughout his writing, and is therefore complex and
varying, especially aft er the “turn” in his later work. But, says Polt, what remains
constant is that the story of Being is a story of decline, “a fall from a promising Greek
beginning” (132).
In his attempt to restore the power of Being, therefore, Heidegger proposes
to explore the earliest extant written clues to our origins. In his development of
these etymologies, Heidegger’s readings of the Greek texts are controversial. John
Stewart, among others, has raised the question of whether these readings are in fact
supported by the texts themselves (“Speech and Human Being” 64); and Richard
Rorty has gone so far as to call Heidegger’s etymologies “largely fake” (Contingency,
Irony, and Solidarity 131). Polt characterizes them as “idiosyncratic,” and wonders
whether, in his selection of Greek texts to deconstruct, Heidegger is “so attracted to
