Forum Day Four: Session Three 515
ERHARD
You’re trying to address what I put out there using your approach. And you need a little bit of 
your approach. But we don’t need to discuss that; you’ll come up with that with your genius 
in that quarter. You don’t need to discuss that with me. What you need to do is create the 
possibility and to let yourself be free in the possibility. All the rest of it you’re thrown to.
 
WALT
Okay, so create the possibility.
ERHARD
Yeah, that’s what I said. You can have anything out of The Forum you can stand for having 
gotten. “Stand for having gotten” and “create the possibility” are synonymous.
WALT
And that’s the declaration.
ERHARD
Yeah. That’s: generate a conversation for. 
WALT
So if I don’t screw with that, it’s going to be all right.
ERHARD
Yeah, just handle that... No, I don’t know whether it’s going to be all right. All I know is that 
you’re going to have power in the face of the risk that life is. That’s all I promised you. I didn’t 
promise you things would be all right. I promised you the power and ability. I don’t know about 
all right.
WALT
Thanks, Werner.
ERHARD
Yes, you’re welcome.
(applause)
Bill? Stand up.
Bill stood, the participant from the chocolate/vanilla demonstration, who also confronted Erhard on 
the fi rst day of The Forum concerning being pressured to be in the course.
(continuing)
It’s called equal time, Bill. It’s called “only fair.”
