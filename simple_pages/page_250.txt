SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
What he’s saying is that the way you’re listening to what’s happening in the room is like a 
concept. You’re doing the same thing Angel’s doing, just a diff erent meaning. Hers is “As the 
Turd Whirls,” and yours is “Fireside Chat with” whatever your name is. 
JACOB
Yeah, but the point is, if you don’t change, then it’s not...
KIPP
And this is more of it. This is more Angel coming out of you. Same thing!
JACOB
Yeah.
KIPP
Same thing. Diff erent meaning, that’s all. And you’re attached to those quotes like she’s 
attached to the soap opera.
JACOB
Okay, okay, okay.
KIPP
That’s “shut up, shut up, shut up.”
JACOB
I didn’t mean that.
KIPP
Yes you did.
JACOB
I didn’t mean for it.
KIPP
Yeah, that’s the problem. That’s what you’re saying. You see, you don’t want to be with that 
it’s empty and meaningless. You’ve got a nice neat package, just like Angel’s got a dramatic 
package.
JACOB
And the problem with that is that I’m attracted to that meaning.
KIPP
Attracted to it? You’re addicted to it! That’s all you got.
