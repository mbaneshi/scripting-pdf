ERHARD
Why don’t you stand up for a while?
PAUL  (standing and receiving a microphone)
To me being inauthentic is to say you’re going to do something without fully intending to do it. 
That’s inauthentic to me.
ERHARD
Try to keep in mind I’ve been discussing this for seventeen years with people almost as smart as
you are. And I’m still saying this thing. I haven’t met the person, although I haven’t met anyone
as smart as you...
PAUL
Nor have I met anybody as smart as you.
ERHARD
You don’t know that.
PAUL
I know I don’t, but neither do you know what you are saying.
ERHARD
Oh, you’re going to do your program with me, right?
PAUL
Oh no, I’m just...
ERHARD
Wait, wait. I don’t know a word for that except “asshole.”
(laughter)
If someone pays $625 to come in and take my course and they take the time to do their course 
with me for free, that’s an asshole.
PAUL
You’re playing with words.
ERHARD
What isn’t playing with words?
PAUL
Well anything nonverbal is obviously not playing with words.
