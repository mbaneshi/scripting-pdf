Forum Day Three: Session Four

being is not like that quite. There’s causality too, but there’s a more subtle relationship, one of
context and content. Contexts don’t cause contents. The relationship is not one of causality. It’s
a diff erent relationship. But it’s like cause and eff ect, but not the same.
SUZANNE
I’m equating achievement as power.
ERHARD
I don’t have any problem with that. However, achievement, even as power, in the context
“there’s something wrong,” each achievement reinforces the context: the more achievement,
the stronger, more forceful the context. As you build content, you validate the context. So for
example, if I say two, and three, they’re content in the context called numbers. You follow that?
SUZANNE
Yes I follow that.
ERHARD
Very good. If I go on to seventy-four, ninety-nine, one third, and three point one four, I’ve
expanded the amount of content, and by doing so I’ve validated the context called numbers. The
context called numbers has gotten stronger and stronger. Even if the content is empowering,
nevertheless the context is more and more validated. Clear?
SUZANNE
There is an aspect in that logic on what’s wrong: that area I’d like to explore.
ERHARD
Please.
SUZANNE
I don’t see... I still don’t understand that statement. I’d like to go deeper. But then, not that
I’m confused. I got an equation of the earlier, I never, I don’t want to share. But this particular
premise strikes me because of achievement, the word achievement I equate with power.
ERHARD
First off , you’ve got your foot nailed to the fl oor about achievement a little bit—like some of you
had your foot nailed to the fl oor about God and some of you had your foot nailed to the fl oor
about sincerity—it’s kind of like you have idolized accomplishment a bit. Accomplishment is
kind of like the Holy Grail for you. A little bit, and so it makes the conversation a little bit hard
for you to hear. A little bit it sounds like I’m denigrating accomplishment. I’m actually not
denigrating accomplishment, but never mind, it sounds like I am. Does it not?
SUZANNE
It did at the beginning.
attainment of the clearing of aletheia (please see the sidebar “The
Three Levels of Truth” in Session Two of Day Four). Both positive
and negative, emergence and concealment, violence and aletheia,
are constitutive of Being. This idea is worked out most fully in
Heidegger’s conception of the “Nothing.” ■

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Sure. So it makes the conversation a bit hard for you to hear. But now that we’ve said that let’s
do what you asked to have done and take a deeper look.
SUZANNE
Yes.
ERHARD
So, did it make sense—was it valid for you—what I said that you and I and everybody else,
as little girls or boys, had experiences in which it’s entirely logically, so powerfully logical, so
predictable that we’re going to conclude that there’s something wrong, that we could all accept
that at some point in our childhood we did conclude that there’s something wrong here? Or was
that the logic you were questioning?
SUZANNE
I’m not going to add to that statement. That’s a period. There’s something wrong here. But in
addendum you said “there’s something wrong here and the achievement is there.” That premise
is correct.
ERHARD
Okay good, I’m just trying to fi nd out where the sticking point is.
SUZANNE
I agree with that premise.
ERHARD
So then I said that it’s not a mere conclusion, I said that you become that there is something
wrong. You are that there is something wrong. You know, you’re a four-year-old, a fi ve-year-
old, and become that there’s something wrong and it becomes the shaping ground of being for
everything you built. See, you built a Suzanne, and I built a Werner, and he built whoever he is.
And I did it over years. I had a certain aspect of me built by the time I was fi ve. I had another
aspect of myself built by the time I was nine. By the time I was seventeen I was pretty much
built. Everything I’ve done since I was seventeen has been additive. I’ve gotten a little better, or
a lot better at those things I was good at, or the things I could be good at. In any case, around
that age, seventeen or twenty, they’ve built their persona, they’ve built an identity, they’ve built
a self. Okay, I said that that self that I built was built in response to the ground of being called
there is something wrong here.
SUZANNE
For this moment I will accept that and think about it.
ERHARD
Okay. Let me just give you one thing. That’s an assertion. And an assertion deserves evidence,
because an assertion is a promise that I’ve got evidence. So I’m going to give you my evidence.
