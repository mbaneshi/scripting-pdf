SPEAKING BEING
haven’t started your own business yet; the past is: all the reasons for doing it, right? Now, start 
your own business, work for a small company: choose!
JOAN
Start my own company.
KIPP
Good. Now why are you going to start your own company?
JOAN
Because it sounds like fun.
KIPP
Good. Then when it’s not fun, you’re going to go: “Well, this really wasn’t fun! I really thought 
it was going to be fun, but now it’s not, so now I’m not going to do it anymore.” Do you under-
stand? Are you hearing your own reasons?
JOAN
Here are my reasons...
KIPP
By the way, they aren’t even your reasons. They are reasons given to you by being human.
JOAN
Does choosing have anything to do with looking forward with nothing out there and not look-
ing behind you?
KIPP (now face-to-face with Joan)
It’s got to do with you saying so. You being the chooser. When you make a choice, you’re the
chooser. When you make a decision, the reasons are doing the deciding, not you. 
JOAN
Okay.
KIPP
Start your own business, work for a small company: choose!
JOAN
I’ll choose working for a small company.
KIPP
Okay. Fine. And why are you going to do that? Neither one is better than the other. That’s fi ne. 
We’re just distinguishing choice. “I choose to work for a small company because...”
KIPP (continuing)
