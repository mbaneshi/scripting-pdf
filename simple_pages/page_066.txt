SPEAKING BEING
PAUL
Yes, if that is your way of being.
ERHARD
That is what I said. I said if you present yourself in one way, and you’re actually being another 
way, that’s inauthentic. Right?
PAUL
Sure, if you’re mindful of the fact that you’re that other way.
ERHARD
Well how about if the moon comes up blue with pink polka dots?
PAUL
Well...
ERHARD
How about if the world ends in 30 seconds? My question is: Why are you coming up with these 
little things about intentionality, when what I’m saying is very simple?
PAUL
Well, because it implies will. 
ERHARD
It doesn’t imply anything. If you present yourself one way, when in fact you are another way, 
that’s inauthentic. If it says gold stamped on a thing and it’s not gold, that’s inauthentic.
PAUL
No.
ERHARD
It’s when you present yourself one way, and you’re another way—that’s inauthentic.
PAUL
Well, I don’t agree, but still. I think that’s the wrong word.
ERHARD (to Jake)e
Do you get that he doesn’t agree with that?
JAKE
Can I respond to what you’re saying?
