Forum Day Four: Session One
353
JOYCE
It doesn’t change anything externally.
ERHARD
It doesn’t change anything. It doesn’t change any little thing. It changes absolutely nothing. It’s 
a bullshit conversation. It’s like talking about “Which way is left?” 
(to Joyce) 
Which way is left?
(she points to her left)
No, that’s right. 
JOYCE
No, it’s not right.
ERHARD
It is so right!
JOYCE
To you.
ERHARD
But do you see how nonsensical this conversation is between you and me now? 
JOYCE
Yes.
ERHARD
Liking yourself and not liking yourself is just as nonsensical. You got conned into some bullshit 
conversation.
JOYCE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Did you ever hear people on drugs talking? They’re like, nutty. Like myself/don’t like myself is 
the same crap. “Whoa. Sha? Go man! Jack Damn!” What does all that shit mean? 
(laughter)
It’s all drama, drama. You ever been to the movies?
