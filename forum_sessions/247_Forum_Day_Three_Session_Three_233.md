Forum Day Three: Session Three 233
life. What got you there gives you the problems you got. It’s not that you fucked something
up on the way. It’s that you succeeded. If you use what you got to get where you are, it
produces success and a certain set of problems. You cannot solve those problems with that
with which you succeeded, because those problems are a product of that which you used
to succeed. Did you get that? Those problems are a product of getting here, and you can’t
solve those problems with what got you here. Because what got you here, got you here and
gave you those problems. You can’t solve the problems you have at the level at which you
generated the problems.
KIPP
So what’s required is a new level of thinking. Here’s what that looks like: You want all my aces?
Here!
Kipp threw forward the pieces of paper representing his aces.
KIPP
But you can’t do that because if you did, you’d get used by life.
ERHARD
He’s a little too funny. And you don’t get it. You fucking assholes! You held on to your aces so
you wouldn’t get used. You’re going to go to your grave holding your aces.
Kipp continued the bit, very fl amboyantly demonstrating not giving aces away to this wife, this job,
etc.
KIPP
See, I wasn’t going to give my aces to my wife Christine, because she wasn’t the one. You
know what the one looks like. Tall, blonde, always rides the horse and never wears clothes. So
anytime I would be at a party with Christine, I wouldn’t stand too close to her in case the one
came riding in on the horse, I could just jump on and ride off  into the distance. How about that
job? You’re not going to give your aces to that job, that’s just the practice job. What about your
body? The question is: What is going to be written on your gravestone?
ERHARD
You get the point. This is not your real life. You’re living your practice life. Nobody would
be stupid enough to take their real life and do what you’ve done with it. Suppose you were
married to your real wife–I mean like the real one. Man, you would give everything to her.
Everything you’ve got. But the one you’re married to now is your “practice wife.” Here’s how
you can tell. If she were the one, the woman of your dreams, you wouldn’t be like you are
with her, and you know it. The same with your job. You don’t give everything you’ve got to
this job. This is just a practice job. You keep your aces for when the real one comes along.
That’s when you’ll spend your life on your life, when the real one comes along, but not on
this life.
If you use what you got to get where you are, it
produces success and a certain set of problems.
You cannot solve those problems with that with
which you succeeded, because those problems
are a product of that which you used to succeed.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (walking across the room, speaking softly)
There’s no real one. This is it. It’s not going to get any better. It’s not going to work out. The
right one is not going to come along. The right job isn’t going to come along. This is the only
job there is, this is the only wife there is, this is the only life there is. This is not practice. You’re
bullshitting yourself. This is the game, and you’re playing like you’re in practice. You want to get
that this is the game. The right circumstances in which to be happy are not going to come along.
They’re not. You’re waiting for it to turn out. Life is not going to work out. And someday it’s not
going to be all better. Today is the way it is today and someday is the way someday is going to be.
And in between it’s going to be the way it is in between. And the ultimate beyond that will be
the way it is there.
(speaking forcefully, while walking among the group)
This is not a practice life. Whatever you’ve got when you die, you’re going to die with it. And you
are going to die with your aces. You thought “asshole” was insulting. It’s starting to make sense,
isn’t it? It was a bit of a compliment, wasn’t it?
(laughter)
A participant named Jacob stood and took a microphone.
JACOB
Angel seems to be very concerned about the notion that nothing means anything.
ERHARD
No no. Nobody said “nothing means anything.”
JACOB
Well, at any rate...
ERHARD
It means what it means.
JACOB
Well, at any rate...
ERHARD
A bowl is a bowl.
JACOB
Yeah.
ERHARD
It’s not nothing. It’s a bowl.
The right circumstances in which to be happy
are not going to come along. They’re not. You’re
waiting for it to turn out. Life is not going to
work out. And someday it’s not going to be all
better. Today is the way it is today and some-
day is the way someday is going to be. And in
between it’s going to be the way it is in between.
And the ultimate beyond that will be the way it
is there.
