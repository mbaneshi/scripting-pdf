SPEAKING BEING
Erhard left the room at this point. Wes was on the platform, Kipp down among the group. 
WES
You sure about that? Because you and your roommate discuss it a lot, right?
PATSY
Only at work.
(laughter)
WES
I see, so it keeps you from working. I can understand it.
PATSY
While I’m here being human, I want it to be good for me. I want to like what I’m doing.
Wes produced a clipping from a South Korean newspaper.
WES (referring to the newspaper clipping)
This is your life. This is how your life could be with a little more signifi cance. Here’s the title: 
“Wife is late with the lunch, kills herself.”
He read aloud the account, which concerned a woman who had forgotten that daylight savings time 
was being instituted for the fi rst time. As a result, she had prepared her husband’s lunch late. She 
then killed herself. 
WES
You think she was dealing with some kind of meaning there? 
PATSY
No, not a meaning that I know or recognize, or acknowledge.
(laughter)
WES
That’s meaning. A person kills herself because she served lunch an hour late. That’s the 
possibility of a human being’s commitment to having things be signifi cant. You have an analogy 
to that in your life. Really. No kidding.
Erhard had re-entered the room.
ERHARD
Did you not get that your story, read by a person in a diff erent culture, would sound like that 
story sounded to you?
