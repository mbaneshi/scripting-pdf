SPEAKING BEING
person who goes around pretending you’re going to do what you say you’ll do. Isn’t it true that 
you present yourself as someone who’ll do what you say you’ll do? But isn’t it true that maybe 
you’ll do it and maybe you won’t? And you always justify it. Everybody does what they can’t
justify not doing. Why is that?
t
PARTICIPANT
If justifi cation equals doing it, when you don’t have a justifi cation for not doing it, then you
have to do it.
ERHARD
That’s a little sophisticated for us today.
ANOTHER PARTICIPANT
Because I want to be right.
ERHARD
You do what you feel like, or what is convenient, but you justify it so you can be right.
(pausing)
Diogenes looked for an honest man. I want to fi nd someone who is late. I’m fi fty-four years old 
and I’ve never found anyone who’s just late. It’s always “I’m late” plus the reason. By the way,
(pointing to the “what happened” circle) 
here’s “I’m late”...
(pointing to the “story” circle) 
...and here’s the reason. Being late is in a totally diff erent realm than the reason for being late.
And the two are not related. “I’m late” and the reasons arise in diff erent realms of existence. 
They’re apples and oranges. They don’t go together.
(to a drowsy participant) 
Remember the rules about sleeping. You’ve got to do it bolt upright. You may make it before the
week is over.
He tossed the chalk he was holding at another participant, who remained seated during the follow-
ing exchange.
ERHARD
Only bolt upright can your eyes be closed.
PARTICIPANT 
They weren’t closed.
“ 
Isn’t it true that you present yourself as 
someone who’ll do what you say you’ll do? 
But isn’t it true that maybe you’ll do it and
maybe you won’t?
ERHARD (continuing)
