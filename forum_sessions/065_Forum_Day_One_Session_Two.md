Forum Day One: Session Two
51
ERHARD
The point is, to present your self in one way and be another way is inauthentic.
PAUL
Yeah, that’s true.
ERHARD
That’s what I said from the beginning. It’s like I said one and one is two, and then you say,
“Well, not always...”
PAUL
But that doesn’t account for intention. There are some things within one person’s realm of con-
trol and other things that aren’t.
ERHARD
You’re nutty about this too.
(pointing to Jake)
I want you to listen here. We’ll get this now. I don’t know if he’ll get it, but you’ll get it.
PAUL
I’m trying to clarify the distinction.
ERHARD
Hold on. I understand. See, look: I didn’t say anything about intention. You brought that up,
actually it was Jake, but in this conversation, you brought that up.
PAUL
Yes.
ERHARD
I said that “inauthentic” was to present yourself in one way, and be another way. That’s pretty
goddamn simple, isn’t it?
PAUL
Sure, yeah.
ERHARD
And is that inauthentic?
52
SPEAKING BEING
PAUL
Yes, if that is your way of being.
ERHARD
That is what I said. I said if you present yourself in one way, and you’re actually being another
way, that’s inauthentic. Right?
PAUL
Sure, if you’re mindful of the fact that you’re that other way.
ERHARD
Well how about if the moon comes up blue with pink polka dots?
PAUL
Well...
ERHARD
How about if the world ends in 30 seconds? My question is: Why are you coming up with these
little things about intentionality, when what I’m saying is very simple?
PAUL
Well, because it implies will.
ERHARD
It doesn’t imply anything. If you present yourself one way, when in fact you are another way,
that’s inauthentic. If it says gold stamped on a thing and it’s not gold, that’s inauthentic.
PAUL
No.
ERHARD
It’s when you present yourself one way, and you’re another way—that’s inauthentic.
PAUL
Well, I don’t agree, but still. I think that’s the wrong word.
ERHARD (to Jake)e
Do you get that he doesn’t agree with that?
JAKE
Can I respond to what you’re saying?
