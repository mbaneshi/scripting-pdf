Forum Day Four: Session Two
407
TIM
Some.
WES
No, all of them! When they’re solutions. Take a look. It’s a very nasty trap. What’s a very big
problem for somebody in high school?
TIM
Zits.
(laughter)r
WES
Yeah but only because zits mean something: That’s the real problem.
TIM
Yes.
WES
If all the models had zits, zits would be good. What does that mean?
TIM
Looking good.
WES
Getting a boyfriend, getting a girlfriend, and getting laid. Have you forgotten?
(laughter)r
Grades too, but we’ll talk about getting laid because it’s more fun.
(laughter)r
So that’s the big problem. Look back at your life and look at teenagers and see what it’s all
about. It was about getting a girlfriend, getting a boyfriend, and getting laid, and also getting
laid with the right one. So, many people immediately solved that problem right out of high
school. What did they do?
TIM
They get married. And then they’ve got a new problem.
WES
That becomes the next problem. Aren’t marriages that solve problems the next problem? I didn’t
say marriages are a problem. Listen carefully. Marriage is not a problem. Marriage is marriage.

SPEAKING BEING
But when marriage is a solution to a problem, it becomes the next problem. This is the way it is
for most people: For most people a relationship is a solution to a problem. What do you think
that does to the relationship? It turns it into a thing, with a group of expectations. It becomes
part of your racket. That’s not relating. You turn someone else into a solution to your problem.
That’s what you’re relating with and that’s not relating. That’s making it a problem. How many
people found it diffi  cult at some point in The Forum, for them?
(a large number of people raising their hands)
You know how some people solved that problem? There are people for whom that’s a real prob-
lem. When they experience something, that’s a real problem; they don’t like something, it’s a real
problem. You know how they solve that? Some people? They leave. That’s their solution to the
problem. Not a lot of people; a couple people. You think that ends up as a problem for them? What
about the relationships that you’ve left? Look at a relationship. And it was a problem and the way
you dealt with it is you left it. You will drag that crummy relationship around with you forever.
That’s this whole thing about being incomplete with your parents: That’s at the source of it.
TIM
Okay I understand it in the examples you used and it makes real sense that solutions become
problems.
WES
Well, it’s part of the quote that Kipp butchered. Where is Kipp? I’ll read it to you exactly: “The
world that we have made as a result of the level of thinking we have done thus far creates prob-
lems that we cannot solve at the same level we created them at.” Because if we solve them at the
same level we created them at, we are in worse shape.
TIM
Well that still doesn’t address the issue though of needing to be solved.
WES
No, no, no, no, you’re trying to go too fast. You’re trying to solve the problem called “solving
doesn’t work.”
TIM
Yeah, that you solve it at a diff erent level. That’s the invitation of Einstein anyway: to solve it at
a diff erent level.
WES
We’re going to give you a diff erent level. And it won’t be the level... the level that you deal with
problems, what you call solutions...
TIM
The “shouldn’t be...”
WES (continuing)
