Forum Day Four: Session Two

do, then you have your pals there, and you go up to them and you say, “you know that thing
I said I was going to do? Well I didn’t do it, but you know what happened? You know how
my mother... and I was busy, I got real afraid, and I didn’t feel real good, either. You under-
stand, right?” And of course my pal’s job—if he’s my friend, my buddy—his job is to buy
my reasons. Why? So when he doesn’t do what he said he was going to do, he’s got his mark
all set up. So he comes to me and says “Hey Kipp, remember that thing I said I was going to
do? Well I didn’t do it because...” What a lot of your friendships are based on is buying each
other’s reasons—interlocking conspiracies of disloyalty. That’s what you call your friends:
people who buy your crap. See, if somebody comes along and sticks your crap back in your
face, you get offended. Those are the people who are going to make some kind of difference
in your life. The ones that are straight with you. You’ve got the people in your life trained to
not be straight with you. You better find some people in life to be straight with you—they
aren’t going to be so reasonable.

One of the things you can count on in the seminar program is the conversations you’re going to
have there are going to be very unreasonable.
(shifting)
So, we’re practicing a new conversation that involves the destruction of reasons and the creation
of participation. I want you to turn to the person next to you and practice this conversation. So
get a partner...
Participants organized themselves into pairs with Wes assisting them.
WES
Here’s what you’re going to say: “In this part of my life I didn’t participate, and these are
the reasons I’ve used.” And while saying this, see if you’re willing to give up these reasons,
and if you are, then create some way of saying how you’re now going to participate there.
You’re creating a commitment to participate. You’ll notice you don’t even need to give a
reason for it. You’re just sort of saying you will and you’re confronting the reasons for not.
Listen for the possibility of participating in life rather than to the reasons for not. Pick who
will go first. Ready? Begin.
Participants shared with each other for several minutes. Wes directed participants to provide feed-
back, then to switch roles. Wes then gave the participants another opportunity to share once again
with their partners, after having reiterated the instructions, emphasizing the requirement to clearly
state what the reasons were for not participating in life (“why you shouldn’t, wouldn’t, or couldn’t...”),
and to express willingness to give up the reasons.
WES
Stop. Please acknowledge the person who shared with you. We’ve begun a conversation for
participating in life. One of the things we want to deal with is where people get stuck in their

lives, how they get stuck in their lives, and a way of shifting that. The fundamental place where
people get stuck is in their problems. You know the problems you have in life? You can have a
breakthrough in the matter of your problems. Parts of the conversation will be fairly abstract.
You want to give up your considerations about abstractions. To get a sense of what your prob-
lems are, look at places in your life where you are stuck. You’ll notice that that’s a place you
never would in a million years fi nd it possible to participate. There’s a real problem there. Get
up some of your real problems for yourself. What are some synonyms for problems? Looking at
a real problem in life?
Participants shouted out various answers: diffi  culty, stopped, upset, stuck, barrier, worries, suff ering,
concerns, burden, hassle.
WES
Fundamentally what a problem is, is something is stopped: Something is stuck. The way in
which you are dealing with it is: There is a stuckness. There’s not movement. When you’re
moving, you’re not stuck. You may be dealing with something. It may be diffi  cult to deal with
but it doesn’t occur as a problem. Problems are places you are ineff ective. And you are ineff ec-
tive, obviously, because of circumstances, reasons, situations, and so forth. The fi rst thing to
look at is where problems occur. You can’t be eff ective with something if you don’t know its
location. So if I try to move the chair and I think the chair is here...
(indicating a location on the stage in which there is not a chair)r
...the chair’s not going to be moved. So we have to get where problems occur. A problem
seems to occur in the world, doesn’t it? Think of your problems: Somehow the problem is out
there. And that’s what makes it so diffi  cult to deal with: It’s out of your control. And out there
where it lives is very big. And fundamentally that’s the thing that makes people ineff ective
with problems, because problems don’t occur out there. There are no problems, as problems,
out there. “I’ve got cancer. It’s in my body.” The cancer may be in your body, but the problem
you’ve got with the cancer isn’t in your body. “My car is a piece of crap. That’s a real problem
for me.” There’s no problem with your car. The cancer as a problem, your car as a problem, your
children as a problem, are not out there. Problems don’t occur in the world as problems. Rocks
don’t have problems, even the ones that get kicked and fall down the hill. That is not a problem
for the rock. See if you can point at where problems are. Take a shot.
(indicating his mouth)
I didn’t say there are no problems. There are problems. They just don’t occur out there. They occur
over here. They are in your speaking and your listening. Or more rigorously, problems are in lan-
guaging. No languaging, no problems. The home of problems is languaging. The home of reality,
for life for human beings, is in languaging. The occurrence “problems” occurs in languaging.
Rocks don’t speak and listen, and so don’t have the problems human beings have as problems.
PAULA
Is languaging and distinguishing the same thing? What about signing?
