Forum Day Three: Session Four 
271
consistent with what your racket is up to. So you’re going to have emotions appropriate to what 
your racket is up to. If what your racket is up to is avoiding domination, for you Fred, given the 
way you’ve got it structured, it’s going to produce a bit of fear. The fear is not the source of it. 
The source of it is avoiding the domination of the responsibility for being powerful and able. 
FRED
Thank you...
ERHARD
See if you weren’t frightened, you couldn’t justify avoiding. If you weren’t sad you wouldn’t 
have a reason. 
(to Kipp)
We didn’t deal with reasons yet have we?
KIPP
No.
ERHARD (jokingly)
Why are we so far behind?
KIPP
That’s one of my issues.
(laughter)
ERHARD
Comes up particularly around me, right? Otherwise he’s fi ne. Around me he’s got this issue. 
(returning to the topic)
Very important to get this. I want to cut out this crap of explaining your life on the basis of the 
way you feel... Fred is giving you the insight that the way you feel is a product of your racket, 
not the other way around. You are not molded by your fear. Your fears are there merely to be 
consistent with what your racket is up to, so you have got this kind of justifi cation. You are 
not run by your emotions. That’s the apparency. Underneath that, what’s driving things is the 
racket. 
FRED
Part of what I was looking at was also the inauthenticity/authenticity issue. I had it all wired 
that I was absolutely authentic. All I had to do was be around and I was authentic. And when I 
could accept the fact that I am inauthentic, not like guilt, or like mortal sin, or like confession...
