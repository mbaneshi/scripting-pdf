Forum Day Four: Session Three 509
won’t get anything else out of The Forum that’s worth anything. What you’ll get out of your
participation in The Forum is what you’re willing to stand for having gotten. You don’t get
what you’re checking to see if you’ve gotten...” Let me see, what happened to me? Did my mind
change? Did my feelings change? Did my eyesight change? Am I taller? Am I thinner? Do I
feel better?” You can’t have any of that. If you’re willing to stand for having been empowered
in here, you can walk out of here empowered. That’s the truth. This isn’t some airy-fairy crap.
You are not the fi rst people I have done this work with. This is grounded on a lot of evidence.
You paid your $625. You bust your ass for four days, you still got one evening to go. Whatever
possibility you’re willing to stand for, whatever conversation for possibility you’re willing to
generate, that’s what you will have gotten. Whatever possibility you’re willing to stand for, that’s
what you can have. What you’ve done in here has given you the power to realize what you’re
willing to stand for, not like a formula, but like a possibility in which you can act and be. Not
like a guaranteed outcome, not like playing tennis with a three-year-old; being fully at risk, but
being fully empowered in the face of the risk. If you don’t like risk, you don’t like life. So we’re
up to the last thing now. Kind of. I say kind of because I never know what’s really last. Who has
any questions?
A participant raised his hand.
RICHARD
I got what I paid my money for. What has happened in the last few months is that my projects
have become so successful that they’re bigger than my possibility for them.
ERHARD
You hear what he said? He used up the world of possibility. The content has overwhelmed
the context. He’s created a possibility and has related to that possibility powerfully enough,
with the power to fulfi ll the possibility such that the content is overwhelming the context.
You know what a hero is? Not what you think a hero is. A hero is not some dashing fi gure, an
extraordinary person. Only ordinary people can be heroes. A hero is an ordinary person who
dares to recognize and accept the call of a possibility bigger than themselves. Real simple.
A hero is an ordinary person who sees, who hears, who is open to, and accepts the call of a
possibility bigger than themselves, or herself or himself.
CECILIA
I’ve accomplished a lot and I’m an artist and illustrator. I’ve done book publishing, and so all
this work is sixty percent solitary at least, and I’ve been having this conversation for years that
I ought to go participate with other people. And so once and a while I go do that from “ought
to.” I’ve done some good things but in the end I say “Jeez! That was a mistake. I wish I had done
that by myself after all.” I mean the nurturing is kind of awful out here and I’ve been doing this
work for years going in and out of that. And what I fi nally got these last four days was that it’s
never going to work if I think I have to go and do it. It’s like “Gee, I already like this thing I’m
doing: painting. It’s meaningless, so I’ll just do it!” But I also got that I had killed off  one of the
main human attributes, which was love.

SPEAKING BEING
CECILIA (continuing; breaking into tears)
What I can do now is go out and be with you all from my love for you all, rather than because I
think I ought to.
ERHARD
Very nice.
(applause)
HENRY
I’m speaking and listening and it’s like the fi rst time. I’ve been stingy and this is the fi rst time
that I’m not. I called my father and my mother. I told them that I loved them and they told me
they loved me. I told them they were okay by me. My father said, “Well that’s interesting!” I
asked him if I was okay by him and he said “Sure you’re okay by me.” My relationships with my
mother and father are complete. I say so.
ERHARD
By the way: They are if you say so. Not like you want to say so. You’ve got to be free to say so.
You can’t say so in-order-to. You’ve got to be standing where what you say is so. We’ll talk about
that in a moment. Please go on.
HENRY
Everything that I’ve accomplished in my thirty-two years of my life is empty and meaningless. I’m
okay with that. My life is perfect. What’s happened for me in the last several days is... I’m standing
here trembling in awe and respect and gratitude for the incredible space of listening that you’ve
created. I’m expressing myself for the fi rst time. The parts of The Forum that have been diffi  cult
for me—I’m going through The Forum thinking I’m the only one going through this. But I’ve
seen myself in everybody’s share and it hasn’t been diffi  cult or painful. It’s been great. I’ve gotten
it: My back pain is gone, the stuff y nose is gone. I’ve got beyond the fi ve-year-old. I was that “I
can’t remember beyond fi ve-years-old.” I don’t know whether I’m remembering what happened
or remembering the story, but I’ve started to remember when I was very young. And what that
frees up for me: I couldn’t own what was invisible to me. The racket, which came from incidents
that were invisible to me and blocked out from me, kept coming up, and the incidents were so
far back, way earlier than I’ve ever looked before. Even though I’ve done the training before, I’ve
never experienced what I have now. I’ve always shared to look good, and now I’m sharing to
contribute. I feel like the amount of time that people will listen to me is very short, and so I speak
fast, cram it all in and nobody gets it. And I’m just worse off  afterwards. It was an in-order-to.
ERHARD
Say what’s there instead of talking about it. I didn’t say, “say it fast,” I said “say what’s there.”
You may have already said what you stood up to say, which is “I love you. And I respect you.
And I acknowledge you.” If you’ve got something beyond that to say, say it. But get to the punch
line. If you’re going to talk, do it eff ectively.
The Oblivion of Oblivion
As we stated earlier, Heidegger’s perspective on technology is an
important element in the understanding of Werner Erhard’s work
that we are developing here. Dreyfus finds a useful summary of
this perspective in the response of HAL, the computer/robot in
