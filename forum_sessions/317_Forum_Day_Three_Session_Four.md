Forum Day Three: Session Four

ERHARD
Sure because youâ€™re an accomplished person.
LUCY
I am trying to avoid something, that feeling that something is wrong. But the next question that
comes to mind is what is the strategy to fi x that? And you said you donâ€™t fi x it.
ERHARD
No you donâ€™t.
LUCY
But I donâ€™t agree with that.
ERHARD
Itâ€™s not that you donâ€™t agree with that. You are addicted to fi xing it.
LUCY
Thatâ€™s true.
ERHARD
You have to have an answer.
LUCY
Not an answer, but to fi nd a way to fi x it, and then fi x it.
ERHARD
Yeah. You and Suzanne ought to get together. These are two achievement nuts. You canâ€™t fi x it.
LUCY
Why not?
ERHARD
Well, you tell me how to fi x being dead and Iâ€™ll tell you how to fi x it.
LUCY
Well a lot of things are oneâ€™s frame of mind and how you think things...
ERHARD
Thatâ€™s not true. A lot of things are explained using the terminology of the frame through which
you look at things. Like positive thinking. Good stuff . What kind of a person would need to
think positively?
LUCY
Somebody whoâ€™s kind of negative.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Yeah. Every time you think positively, that is the content. The context is negative, that you are
a negative person. Life is negative. No kidding. Iâ€™ve done that whole achievement thing for
quite a while. Made a lot of money doing that. Lot of money. That whole business about being
successful and achieving, and positive thinking. You name it I did it. And it works. The problem
is that itâ€™s never enough. Never fulfi lled, never whole. What youâ€™re asking me is how to get out
of the trap and the answer is that the attempt to get out of the trap is what keeps you in the trap.
I want you to think about this tonight. This is hard to get. Because getting out is supposed to get
you out. In this case getting out keeps you in. This is a very strange kind of prison. The bars are
not made of iron. They are made out of the attempt to get out of the prison. So Lucy, tonight, I
want you to see if you can come to accept that youâ€™re going to have to live the rest of your life in
this prison.
LUCY
I have another question. The concept... life is empty and...
ERHARD
I donâ€™t talk in concepts. Distinctions.
LUCY
Iâ€™m trying to relate how we can apply it to our lives.
ERHARD
You cannot apply it. Worthless, useless information.
LUCY
Then whatâ€™s the purpose in knowing that? Or accepting that?
ERHARD
Because itâ€™s the truth.
LUCY
But how can knowing that or accepting that create personal power for us?
ERHARD
So wonderful. Hold on one second, Iâ€™ll be right back.
(to the group)
Lucy and I are going to demonstrate terminally that you are addicted to the answer, that you are
addicted to getting out, to getting the answer. That no matter how many times Iâ€™m going to tell
you that the attempt to get out is the bars of the prison, youâ€™re going to spend the rest of your
life trying to get out. Sheâ€™s going to demonstrate the very thing Iâ€™m talking about; sheâ€™s going to
demonstrate that sheâ€™s going to spend the rest of her life trying to get out. And nothing I tell her
is going to stop her. There are no answers. You donâ€™t get out. Itâ€™s not going to work out. Itâ€™s not
