Forum Day Four: Session Three 457
AVRIL
And I think that’s where I get mucked up, you know, the risk: The “should” is so huge that I
keep getting back into the mud with it.
KIPP
That’s why nobody wants choice. It leaves them being responsible. It’s much easier to be used
by whatever life gives you.
AVRIL
Where I feel confused is, when you say “take what you got.” What I got is my husband, so then I
think that...
KIPP
You don’t have your husband.
AVRIL
I have this marriage, this entanglement.
KIPP
What you’ve got is this question about your marriage. That’s what you’ve got.
AVRIL
That’s what I need to choose.
KIPP
That’s what you’ve got right now, right? This question about your marriage.
AVRIL
Right. I feel like I’ve had that for twelve years.
KIPP
That’s your drama, though. You’re pretty dramatic about the whole thing. I’m not trying to
reduce what it is to be married, to love somebody and not have it go according to your dreams,
and what comes along with that, but we’ve had a pretty straight conversation for four days, and
we can kind of cut the drama pretty easily now: to get on with your life. If you didn’t have this
question, this entanglement, what would you get on with? What’s the big payoff  in your life for
all these histrionics?
AVRIL
I feel like I’ve gotten on with it in every other area of my life except this one, and the payoff  is
that I don’t count, or rather, that’s the racket.

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
You getting on with every other area except this one is not getting on at all.
(holding out both hands like the vanilla or chocolate choosing exercise)
Marriage, no marriage, choose. Choose!
AVRIL
No marriage.
KIPP
Okay, now what are we going to do? That’s complete.
AVRIL
Yeah, okay. I was great when I had that...
KIPP
What do you mean when you have that? You just chose it!
AVRIL
Right, but then I thought, but somehow, he doesn’t mean, that’s not what they mean by choice,
because that’s what I got two years ago. And I got lit up about it...
KIPP
But then you got sucked right back into it.
AVRIL
Right, and then my husband comes back with, “You’ve got the marriage you’ve got, so stick
with it.” And we’ve been going around and around for two years.
KIPP
The whole question is what are you willing to be responsible for in your life? Isn’t that it? You
don’t quite want to be responsible for it.
(referring to Vinny)
It’s like, he doesn’t want to be responsible for his own power, so he turns everybody else into an
authority fi gure. Nobody wants to be responsible. It doesn’t come with being a human being. So
you have to go on with this crap about your marriage. You’re either going to be married to him or
not. Both of you are going to die, be buried in a box and have dirt thrown on your face. What’s all
the racket about? What being a human being is about is generating sympathy. You’re going to get
everybody sucked into your sympathy. Sympathy is between shit and syphilis in the dictionary.
(laughter)
But that’s what you sound like. Did you ever see puppies born? Kittens?
