SPEAKING BEING
LOUISE
Yes.
ERHARD
How did you learn?
LOUISE
Just started to go and then discovered that my dad was not behind me.
ERHARD
That’s the story they say. But let me tell you how it happened. When you fi rst sit on a bicycle 
all the sensations are the same. They all feel the same: they’re all falling. At some point some 
sensations are falling and other sensations are not. They’re the same sensations you had when
you fi rst sat on the bicycle, but now some of them occur as falling and some as not falling. That 
happens when the distinction balance is distinguished as a possibility. Now your father told 
you, “you’ve got to balance. And balance is up like this.” That didn’t help. It all still felt like 
falling. When the distinction balance is distinguished—not conceptualized—then some of the 
sensations start to occur as balance, as not falling.

There are no twelve easy steps to distinguishing. If you’re willing to engage in the conversation
there’s a possibility of distinguishing there. Distinction arises in the conversation. You just can’t
see conversation. Very useful conversation. Thank you.

When you said “I promise,” a promise falls out of your mouth; if I had listened to you promise 
twenty times and not keep your promise, then when you said the word “promise,” a promise
wouldn’t fall out of your mouth, just the word “promise” would.
ERHARD
Yeah. If you don’t keep your promise repeatedly, you create a no-possibility listening for promis-
ing, so that what falls out of your mouth is the word. So the possibility lives in the conversation.

So the sacredness of a promise can only live in a conversation.
ERHARD
Yeah. And one of the things that fucks it up brutally is that bullshit about sincerity. Disgusting.
We’ll get to that before The Forum is over.

The other thing. When I say I hate you, what could fall out of my mouth is hate or...
