Forum Day Two: Session Three

ERHARD
Okay. How long have you been suff ering and unhappy?
ANGEL
From what?
ERHARD
From the divorce. Did it take the second divorce?
ANGEL
Yeah. The suff ering and unhappiness was in the marriage.
ERHARD
But you put up with it.
ANGEL
I put up with a lot.
ERHARD
And that was good because somebody who cares more than anybody else in the world will put
up with a lot of shit. So it made you right to suff er in your marriage. Made you a good person.
You know what doormats attract?
ANGEL
People who step on them.
ERHARD
Exactly. You got it. And you know what? A doormat keeps a person who wants to wipe his
feet stuck to the doormat. You dominated him just as sure as I‚Äôm sitting on this platform. You
dominated him by being the victim. Now, he had his racket as well‚Äîtwo racketeers rubbing up
against each other.
ANGEL
We had a great game.
ERHARD
It‚Äôs disgusting.
ANGEL
I couldn‚Äôt play without him.
ERHARD
Right.

SPEAKING BEING
ANGEL
And so I turned it around in my second marriage, where I was happy, but then I created the
divorce so I could be a victim of the divorce.
ERHARD
Watch that word ‚Äúcreated‚Äù; that gets bandied around by people who have done this work, and
they don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about. What happened was: you got divorced. And that
left you deeply unhappy.
ANGEL
The same place I was when I was married before.
ERHARD
Yeah. So you‚Äôve got to get to the point where a fart and having been divorced are on equal levels.
(laughter)r
ANGEL
There‚Äôs something very wrong about that. I don‚Äôt know what it is...
(laughter)r
Is that really possible?
ERHARD
Yeah it is really possible. They‚Äôre both just a ‚Äúwhat happened.‚Äù
(laughter)r
People who get married sometimes get divorced, true or false?
ANGEL
True.
ERHARD
You got married and you got divorced, true or false?
ANGEL
True.
ERHARD
And that‚Äôs what happened. Like a fart.
