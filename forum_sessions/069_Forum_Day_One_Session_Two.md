Forum Day One: Session Two

begin with being authentic. Authenticity begins with being authentic about your inauthenticity.
If you’re ever going to have any degree of authenticity the only way to get there is to start with
being authentic about your inauthenticity.
(to the group)
I’m not interested in your belief systems, I’m not interested in your values, I’m not interested in
your principles. So no more conversations like I just had with Jake and Paul. I don’t mean don’t
say anything, I mean don’t preach. I’ll do all the preaching in here, and if I’m any good, I won’t
do any either. All I’m asking when I talk to you about the things I’m talking about is: build
a square, stand inside of it, look out at life and the world and see what you can see standing
in that square and standing in that possibility. If it empowers you to stand there, keep it. If it
doesn’t empower you to stand there, destroy it. Simple.
BELLA
You said to someone else that something happened when they were a child. I remembered. My
father was a liar, and I decided I could never be that. I had to be honest. I’ve had no freedom to
keep my word.
ERHARD
You can’t be anything you’re forced to be. Anything you are forced to be, you aren’t.
BELLA
I couldn’t stand the feeling.
ERHARD
Yeah.
(to the group)
Who couldn’t stand being a liar?
(several raise their hands)
You think a truth teller would fi nd lying absolutely abhorrent? For the person who tells the
truth you don’t have any problem with a lie, it’s only somebody down in the swamp, in the bot-
tom of the Valley of the Shadow of Death, who is afraid they might be a liar. I know you know
better.
BELLA
I am a liar.
ERHARD
Yeah. You are a liar. That’s being authentic about being inauthentic. And that’s the beginning of
authenticity—and the beginning of the freedom to tell the truth.
“
All I’m asking when I talk to you about the
things I’m talking about is: build a square,
stand inside of it, look out at life and the
world and see what you can see standing in
that square and standing in that possibility.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (to the group)
I know most of you don’t get that, but never mind. Just listen. What today and tomorrow is
about mostly is about being authentic about being inauthentic. So there are a couple of things
to get. One: you present yourself as someone who keeps your word, but in fact you are someone
who does or does not keep your word depending on whether you feel like it. Is that the truth
about you? I told you I don’t know the truth. See if it’s empowering—like trying on a robe.
Two: when you can wear that robe, that’s called being authentic about your own inauthenticity.
Always, the beginning of authenticity is being authentic about your own inauthenticity. I want
you to treat the promises in here diff erently from usual. I want you to say “regardless.” When it’s
all over, maybe you will, maybe you won’t. Sincerity is pure story. I’m asking you to engage in
these promises as a matter of integrity, not sincerity. As a matter of fact, standing in the back-
ground is always the possibility that you may not. But then you won’t, and that’s that.
At 3:12 pm, The Forum adjourned for a second break.

SPEAKING BEING
Dasein: Meaning and Mineness
Dasein is Martin Heidegger’s name for the central figure in his 1927 magnum opus,
Being and Time. The term is one of the few in Heidegger’s writing that consistently
remains untranslated from the German: the most literal translation of Da-Sein is be-
ing-there. Scholar Hubert Dreyfus suggests that the best way to understand Dasein
is to think of “our term ‘human being,’ which can refer to a way of being that is char-
acteristic of all people or to a specific person—a human being” (Hubert L. Dreyfus,
Being-in-the-World 14).
But the term being-there itself indicates the essential characteristic that distin-
guishes humans from other beings. Dasein is being-there because it is the only being
for whom its Being is an issue. Humans are the beings who reflect upon themselves,
and the only ones who exist in a world of meaning. We dwell in a meaningful “there,”
and we bring our “there” along with us when we show up. Other beings inhabit the
earth; human beings live in a world.
This is a challenging and essential aspect of the thinking Heidegger is devel-
oping here, and a distinction that emerges persistently over the four days of The
Forum. The meanings of the things in our world are not properties of the things
themselves. Non-human beings are “entities whose kind of Being is of a charac-
ter other than Dasein’s,” and therefore they must be understood as “unmeaning,
essentially devoid of any meaning at all” (BT 193). When Heidegger says that “only
Dasein can be meaningful or meaningless,” he is saying that other beings can have or
lack meaning only when they are encountered by Dasein and are thereby disclosed as
meaningful or not (BT 192–193). Consider: a dog may not be “a dog” for another dog,
nor may the dog see “beauty” in a sunset. Dasein is the only being in whose world
there is meaning. Only for human beings do things show up as the things they are.
Further, Dasein is the only being for whom existence is always an issue, and the
issue for each Dasein is always fundamentally its own existence. Heidegger calls this
human characteristic mineness: the Being of human beings, while it characterizes
the ontological nature of the collective, always occurs as the Being of a particular
human being. Therefore, while Dasein is not a person, we have to talk about it as if
it were: “Because Dasein has in each case mineness, one must always use a personal
pronoun when one addresses it: ‘I am,’ ‘you are’” (BT 68).
Each Dasein relates to this existential situation in a particular way. “Mineness
belongs to any existent Dasein, and belongs to it as the condition which makes
authenticity and inauthenticity possible” (BT 78, emphasis added). That is, my
SESSION TWO INTERVAL
Dasein is always mine, but whether or not that relationship is authentic—as Werner
Erhard would put it, whether I own the condition of mineness, or whether it owns
me—depends upon an act of existential choice. The purpose of The Forum is to
bring participants face-to-face with that choice, thereby making available the possi-
bility of authentic existence.

SPEAKING BEING
The Forum resumed at 4:00 pm. Erhard was not present for this session. During
the first half-hour, The Forum Supervisor, Julie, oversaw a procedure that took
place in every Forum (but is currently not practiced in The Landmark Forum):
participants raised their hands, section by section, to request rides or places to stay
during the four days of The Forum, and other participants responded with offers.
This process having been completed, Kipp came onto the platform. He introduced
himself and Wes as the two Forum leaders who would be leading The Forum with
Erhard, and then turned to the next order of business: the promises and requests
of The Forum, which Erhard had mentioned earlier in the day. Julie, the Course
Supervisor, came forward.
JULIE
We’re asking you to give your word—to make certain promises—and to keep
your word—to keep the promises.
The required promises:
(1) Regarding speaking in The Forum: Raise your hand, speak into the micro-
phone. Don’t talk to each other during The Forum.
(2) Wear your name tag at all times. Get the name on the tag correct.
(3) Take no notes. No tape recorders or cameras, no busy work at your chair,
no food/drink in the room. Exception: Forum leaders may take notes.
(4) You agree to maintain the confidentiality of The Forum. This includes
names of participants and their remarks. Keep in mind that confidentiality in
a group of this size cannot be guaranteed.
(5) Regarding videotaping: if you didn’t earlier sign a video release, sit in the
no-video section.
(6) No resale agreement. All materials in this program are the property of
Werner Erhard and Associates, in some instances protected by copyright.
You agree not to resell, modify, package, and deliver in a seminar, training
program, workshop, consulting, or similar business activity. This protection
extends beyond the copyright law.
(7) Informed consent. The Forum is not therapeutic in design or intent. Forum
leaders are not trained mental health professionals. A series of questions was
included about participant’s status with regard to therapy. If you’re in therapy
and winning, advise your therapist. If not, or if you’ve been hospitalized for
drug or alcohol abuse, we recommend you don’t take The Forum. In the form
you signed earlier there is a list of emotions which may come up during The
Forum; if you find them threatening, don’t take the Forum. If you have a prob-
lem dealing with stress, don’t take The Forum. Certain medical conditions and
certain drugs are also listed in this category. This informed consent is intended
to have legal significance.
