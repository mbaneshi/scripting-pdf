Forum Day Four: Session Three 489
ERHARD
That’s quite right, it’s not reaction. Is the back of my hand reacting to the front of my hand? No.
It’s correlated to the front of my hand, isn’t it?
BOBBY
Right.
ERHARD
Another word for correlation is something like dancing. You and I dance together; you don’t
move because I move. I don’t move because you move. We move in correlation with one
another. Our motion is correlated. That’s what correlated is: It’s like dancing. You need a poetic
understanding of correlation. Like dancing. Clear?
BOBBY
I don’t understand how catching the dictionary is like dancing.
ERHARD
It’s exactly like dancing. And what you’re dancing with is a fl ying dictionary. And Ellen dances
with the ball as uncatchable sometimes and at other times she dances with the ball as catchable.
In both cases, Bobby, her actions are perfectly correlated to the ball.
BOBBY
No thinking.
ERHARD
It’s not a matter of “no thinking.” There may be thinking as well. That’s not the point. The point is
that her actions are perfectly correlated to the ball when she’s graceful and perfectly correlated to
the ball when she’s clumsy. That’s why I got someone who was athletic up, because he looks clumsy
when I throw the ball to him in a way that he can’t catch it. That’s pretty clumsy. When I throw the
ball to him so that it looks catchable to him, he’s very graceful in his dealing with it. Clear?
BOBBY
Yeah.
ERHARD
Thank you.
(addressing another participant)
What’s your problem?
(laughter)
BECKY
I don’t get that when I’m driving fast it occurs slow. I’m not even sure I said that accurately.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Do you remember how hard it was to steer the car when you fi rst started to learn to steer the
car?
BECKY
Yeah.
ERHARD
You had to steer it.
BECKY
Yeah.
ERHARD
You don’t have to steer the car anymore, do you?
BECKY
No, right, I don’t.
ERHARD
The road steers the car. You don’t steer the car. The road steers the car. Because when you fi rst
got into the car your actions were a correlate of what you were told to do. That’s all that was
there for you. “Oh, let’s see, he said to do this! Oh, he said to do that! Don’t do this, do that!”
Your actions were correlated to the telling because that was occurring. There wasn’t any road
out there. The road was just frightening. Now there’s nothing between you and the road. The
road does the steering. You don’t say “Curve. Turn slowly.” Your actions are perfectly correlated
with the road as an occurring.
BECKY
Is it that the steering goes out of existence at some point?
ERHARD
Not quite and that’s a diff erent conversation that’ll get you into trouble. That’s the transparency
conversation. That’s not a part of The Forum. That’s another course. You have to pay more
money to get into that conversation.
(laughter)
Yeah, but nevertheless the steering becomes transparent and the instructions become
transparent. Not that there’s no steering wheel. It’s still there. You know for a great typist,
there’s no typewriter.
BECKY
Right.
