Forum Day One: Session Two

ERHARD
Why don’t you stand up for a while?
PAUL  (standing and receiving a microphone)
To me being inauthentic is to say you’re going to do something without fully intending to do it.
That’s inauthentic to me.
ERHARD
Try to keep in mind I’ve been discussing this for seventeen years with people almost as smart as
you are. And I’m still saying this thing. I haven’t met the person, although I haven’t met anyone
as smart as you...
PAUL
Nor have I met anybody as smart as you.
ERHARD
You don’t know that.
PAUL
I know I don’t, but neither do you know what you are saying.
ERHARD
Oh, you’re going to do your program with me, right?
PAUL
Oh no, I’m just...
ERHARD
Wait, wait. I don’t know a word for that except “asshole.”
(laughter)
If someone pays $625 to come in and take my course and they take the time to do their course
with me for free, that’s an asshole.
PAUL
You’re playing with words.
ERHARD
What isn’t playing with words?
PAUL
Well anything nonverbal is obviously not playing with words.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Really? Are you a linguist?
PAUL
Yeah, I speak three languages.
ERHARD
I didn’t ask if you speak three languages, I asked if you understood language. Is that your busi-
ness? Is language your business?
PAUL
No, but I speak several languages.
ERHARD
How many people in this room speak several languages?
(many hands raised)
I have a lot of respect for people who speak several languages. I don’t mean any disrespect, but
it doesn’t mean you know shit about language.
PAUL
Well, language encompasses a pattern of thought, a process of thought. It’s contained within
the language you think within. Like I was referring to with Spanish, you have within the lan-
guage incorporated a structure for dealing with the fact that some things are hypothetical, some
things are real...
ERHARD  (to the group)
You want to listen to this very carefully, because otherwise you’re going to stand up and do this.
And I’m going to let him do this long enough that you can see what it looks like. Go on Paul.
PAUL
The point is, I agree, that to be inauthentic is to, you’re saying that it is to, to do something, to
say you’re going to do something and, nobody knows, I could say I’m going to walk over here,
and the world may end before I get there.
ERHARD
That’s not my point. That’s not what I said.
PAUL
Well, what is the point?
