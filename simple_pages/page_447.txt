Bill, why is the ceiling up there?
BILL
Because it’s up there.
KIPP (pointing at a participant

But Bill, why is Ashley like that?
BILL
Because Ashley’s like that. 
KIPP (pointing at another participant

Wait a second Bill, why is John like that?
BILL
Because John is like that.
KIPP
Yeah, but Bill, what is the sound of one hand clapping?
BILL (to laughter)r
I’ve heard this one before...
He took a long time mulling over this, trying various answers: “it’s nonexistent,” “there is no sound,”
etc. Kipp repeated the prompts for the fl oor and the ceiling, and then returning to the sound of one
hand clapping.
BILL (to laughter)r
It can’t manifest a sound. It must have something to do with the fl oor and the ceiling.
KIPP
Human beings love logic. It’s all got to be logical. Right? What is the sound of one hand clap-
ping?
BILL
There is no sound.
KIPP
Where you are looking there is no sound. But the sound of one hand clapping is what? It’s 
simply what?
