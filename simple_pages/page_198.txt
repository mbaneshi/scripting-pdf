SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
You start participating in your own life, it’s going to be awkward and embarrassing for you. It 
took about three years to train me. I was too embarrassed to be with people.
(prompting Xavier to keep sharing rather than describing) 
And you said? And she said? 
XAVIER
We broke up on Tuesday. 
KIPP
Good. Always break up before The Forum. You might get lucky in here.
(laughter)
Careful. You’re having fun. It might be a shock to your system.
(laughter)
XAVIER
I’m sitting here during The Forum having these thoughts. 
KIPP
No, the thoughts are having you. And the thoughts say?
XAVIER
I’m a worthless piece of shit. 
Kipp crossed the platform to the table, picked up a box of tissues, and used the tissues to demonstrate 
Xavier’s “thoughts” that he was “identifying with,” and “being owned by.” Kipp did this by pulling 
a tissue from the box, wafting it through the air, and inserting it into one of his nostrils, and then 
another in the other nostril, to much laughter.
KIPP (with tissues in his nostrils, regarding Xavier)
And you go?
XAVIER
I’ll never amount to anything.
KIPP (fi lling both ears with tissues; laughter)
And the next thought? 
XAVIER
It’s hopeless.
