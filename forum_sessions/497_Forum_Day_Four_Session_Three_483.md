Forum Day Four: Session Three 483
ERHARD
Good. It’s simple. I understand. Took you a long time to get that simplicity, yes? Anything is
simple. It just takes a long time because we’ve got to get all the garbage out of the way. You
didn’t get what I said even when you felt that you got what I said.
JERRY
I felt I wasn’t listening. I had the problem that I didn’t hear what you said. I wasn’t listening.
ERHARD
I understand. You didn’t hear me because you were listening to your barriers to hearing what I
was saying. And the barriers to hearing what I was saying were provoked by what I was saying.
We’ve been doing that for four days here. We say stuff  that we don’t expect you to get. We say
stuff  designed to drive the barriers up in front of your face. Then we keep dealing with the
barriers. Then you start to drop the barriers. Then all of a sudden it’s empty and meaningless,
and then it’s like “well, obviously it’s empty and meaningless. Why didn’t you just say that in
the beginning?”
(laughter)
Clear? Give me my ball back. Thanks.
(applause)
Let me say it all over again. Here’s what I want you to get out of this. Your actions are not the
actions you want, or the actions you decide. They’re not a product of your past; your actions
are a correlate of the world as an occurring, not the world as an is world, but the world as an
occurring world. Your actions are perfectly correlated to the way the world occurs for you. If
the world occurred for you like it occurs for the person you most despise, you would act like
the person you most despise. No shit. Really. I know you think you’ve got goodness and all
that bullshit inside you. Go to the doctor and have him open you up so you can see. Cut that
noise out. Your actions are a correlate of the world as an occurring. You want me to throw the
dictionary a couple more times so you can see? Now the question is, “Well, what generates this
occurring?” We’re going to get to that, but not until you get... see you’re almost as stupid as you
were when you came in here, because you’re sitting out there trying to decide whether you
agree with this or not.
(laughter)
“Is that right? Do I agree with that? I practiced tennis for ten years, and that practice really
made me a good player. And I remember learning buh buh buh, and that made me better at
that.” Wrong! The practice and the learning alters the occurring. Staying in the conversation
Jerry and I were having: you know, you train an athlete. Most people train athletes like they’re
grooving in behavior, so you do it repetitively, that’s what training is, right? Repetition. So you
do it over and over and over again so you can do it automatically. Horseshit. Anything you do
automatically lacks skill, lacks power. You wouldn’t want an athlete who acted automatically.
You want an athlete free to act with the world he or she has to act within. What happens is,
Your actions are not the actions you want, or
the actions you decide. They’re not a product
of your past; your actions are a correlate of the
world as an occurring, not the world as an is
world, but the world as an occurring world.

SPEAKING BEING
you take behavior out when you train an athlete with repetition. You take behavior out, not add
behavior. He has to do this. You don’t want him to do that. Let him keep doing that and he’ll
stop doing that if the training’s any good, and he’ll be free to do anything. When he’s free to do
anything, he’ll deal with the ball eff ectively. You don’t need to tell people “step back when the
ball bounces in front of you.” Because you’re never going to be eff ective when you’re trying to
remember what to do when the ball bounces in front of you. When the ball bounces in front
of you as catchable, you step back, because stepping back is perfectly correlated with the ball
that bounces in front of you and is catchable. Stepping forward is what you do when the ball
bounces in front of you and it’s not catchable.
(pausing)
Is it starting to get through? Not “do you agree with it?”: Are you able to stand in the possibility
that my actions in life are not a product of internal properties? My actions in life aren’t a product
of anything. My actions in life are a correlate of something. What they are a correlate of is the
world as an occurring. For example, if the world occurs as threatening, your actions will be
perfectly correlated with a threatening world. The question is not: “Is the world threatening?”
The question is: “Does the world occur as threatening?” It’s not that one person is strong and
the other person weak. You think you’re strong, let me put you in a set of circumstances that
occur suffi  ciently threatening and you will cower. People who cower are not weaklings. The
world occurs for them as overwhelmingly threatening. People who are musical: Music occurs
for them in a way that it doesn’t for those of us who are not very musical. The keyboard does
not look like it does to you and me to a pianist. Totally diff erent. I did an experiment driving a
racecar for a year. Didn’t know anything about racing cars when I started. Didn’t even drive for
the most part when I started. I had a license. I hadn’t been in a gas station for something like ten
years. When I started out, the car went very fast. Really fast! I mean overwhelmingly fast. Except
for the guy on the sidelines who had the stopwatch. For him it was going very slow. But the
slower the car went for me, the faster my times were. I could see divots in the roadway a quarter
of an inch deep and put the edge of my tire in that divot. The car got real slow. Real easy to
drive a car slowly. You get into a race car and drive it slowly, it’s easy. Takes no talent, no ability,
which was very good in my case. The slower the car goes the faster the times are, because action
is a correlate of the occurring. How many people in here manage other people?
(several participants raising their hands)
How many other people in the room raise children? That’s managing people, by the way.
(more raising their hands)
Good. Put your hands down. You want to know why your kids act like they do? Because
the world occurs for them in such a way that their actions are a perfect correlate. They do
not do what you tell them to do. No shit. And if you think they’re doing what you tell them
to do, you’re wrong. Their actions are a correlate of the way the world occurs for them.
People murder not because they are bad people. Nobody has ever found bad inside anybody.
People murder because murder is a perfect correlate to a certain kind of occurring. The
law recognizes that by recognizing self-defense. Never mind how they explain it. Ellen is
not clumsy. Her actions are perfectly correlated with the way objects occur for her. She’s

ence what is, we can never belong to what will
be. (Martin Heidegger, “TT” in QCT 49)
