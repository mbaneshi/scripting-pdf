hurt.” This last statement came from a participant who had lived in bed for eight years with back
pain.
WES
What’s here in The Forum now is a safe place to communicate what’s really so for you in your
life. We’ve designed a space in here where you can confront your own fear of being alive, your
own fear of other people and of living. I invite you to experience it, not to avoid it; not to sleep
through it. Wake up! I don’t know who you got out there that you lie to, but the ultimate jerk
is someone who lies to themselves. You may have people conned, but the one person you don’t
want to con is yourself. It turns you into the ultimate jerk. This is a chance to get straight with
yourself, to fi nd out what is running your life.
PARTICIPANT
I’m powerfully addicted to approval. If I don’t get it I leave.
WES
And what’s underneath that is fear.
(to the group)
Let it up in your body. At fi rst you’ll have to reach for it. You’re so dead to it you have to reach
for it. The fear is so frightening that you’ll fi nd an unwillingness to fully get present for it. Let it
up for yourself.
BETHANY
My knees are shaking.
WES
Allow it to be.
BETHANY
I can’t let my sons love me. I ask: “what would happen if I let them love me?”
WES
Here’s what it’s all about. You need to experience your deep and profound fear of being loved by
them. What would happen if you let that in, and then left, or they died?
BETHANY
I don’t know what I would do, or what it would feel like.
WES
Just let yourself experience what stops you from letting them love you. Very simple. Don’t make
any decisions. Just acknowledge and experience the fear. We’re in a group of exercises. That’s
what there is to do in this exercise. Just experience that.
From Fearful to Fearsome
In addition to boredom, two other human moods are presented
by Heidegger as having special potential for making possible an
authentic disclosure of our thrownness.
The first is fear. The evocation of the underlying source of fear
has been a significant element of Erhard’s work since its inception,
in both the est Training and The Forum.
The second is anxiety. Heidegger draws a fundamental
distinction between these two states-of-mind. Fear may of course
take various forms, such as alarm, terror, or dread. But in every
case the source of the fear remains the same: “All modifications
of fear, as possibilities of having a state-of-mind, point to the fact
that Dasein as Being-in-the-world is ‘fearful’” (BT 182, emphasis
added). This is the element of the human condition that is being
distinguished at this point in The Forum. In fear, “that in the face
of which we fear is a detrimental entity within-the-world” (BT
230). That is, we are always afraid of something; something has a
significance, and that significance arouses our fear. But fear is not
generated by the something.
The exercise being initiated by the Forum leader here—
referred to as the Danger Process—is designed to distinguish the
nature and source of the participants’ fear, and to transform their
relationship to life from “life is dangerous” (I am at the eff ect of
life) to “I am dangerous” (I am powerful in life).
Erhard has told the participants that The Forum is designed to
“take them down one step at a time,” and the evocation of fear at
this point is an important step. The structure of the Danger Process
first evokes the fearful mood, so that, in Heidegger’s words,
“fear can then look at the fearsome explicitly, and ‘make it clear’
to itself” (BT 180). But then, in a dramatic example of reflexive
rhetoric, the fearsome is flipped. The fearful become the fearsome.
In this way, participants take an important hurdle, a stretch toward
the ultimate leap of their transformation.
Anxiety
What is concealed in the mood of fear is anxiety. Anxiety, says
Heidegger, is “what first makes fear possible” (BT 230). Fear is, as it
were, anxiety with a false cause. Fear arises when Dasein flees the

SPEAKING BEING
Wes continued taking shares about fear, and unconcealing the fear underneath participants’
fundamental points of view.
WES
Human beings put “bad” around fear. You can’t experience what we called “bad.” But it’s always
there. You’re born into fear. If you don’t believe me, read the newspapers. Newspapers trade on
fear.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 6)
I’ve never been present to as much fear as I’m present to right now. I’m afraid if I share myself
you’ll fi nd out how bankrupt I am, that I’m stupid, uncreative, inadequate, ineff ectual, nasty,
uncaring, and you’ll throw me out of the game. I hate to say this because it’s one of my rackets
to handle this—to be humorous—I’m too short. I can see where my whole life is generated out
of this. I am just terrifi ed. I’ve done everything to prove that I’m intelligent, creative, eff ective,
productive. I lead The Forum which is a perfect way to avoid being present to the terror, when
you’re up there with a microphone and drinking out of a cup, it’s very insulating. I’m terrifi ed of
discovering how worthless I am. I went to an Ivy League university, graduated top of my class, a
successful veterinarian, an eff ective Forum leader, all in an attempt to stop you from seeing that
I’m none of the things I’m supposed to be.
WES
Thanks.
PARTICIPANT
I’m terrifi ed all the time. Scared to death of horror movies.
WES
The fear is always already there. Horror movies just bring it up. Those of you who can’t be
present to the fear raise your hands.
PARTICIPANT
I’m afraid of being alive.
WES
All it takes is being able to acknowledge it. Try on the possibility that you actually are scared
to death, and don’t know it, and don’t know that you don’t know it; that your whole life is a
strategy for avoiding the domination of life. You’re scared of living. It’s too confronting. It’s
all too dangerous. And your whole crummy act is put together as a strategy for making it in a
world of danger. Try it on. Don’t reject it. Just acknowledge it for yourself.
Here Wes called for paired sharing, where participants sitting next to each other replicated for
themselves what others have said before the entire group. Following this, Wes announced an eyes-
closed exercise.
disclosure of its thrownness, and turns in its flight toward entities
in the world, which it then identifies as the source of the fear.
In anxiety, however, the entities in their significance disappear,
and the background to all fears is revealed:
What is the diff erence phenomenally between
that in the face of which anxiety is anxious and
that in the face of which fear is afraid? That in
the face of which one has anxiety is not an entity
within-the-world. . . . That in the face of which
one is anxious is completely indefinite. . . .
[In anxiety], the world has the character of
completely lacking significance. (BT 230–231,
emphasis added)
“
In moments of anxiety, the meanings with which we customarily
comfort ourselves, even the meanings that make us fearful,
lose their certainty, so that what is disclosed is the context of
meaninglessness from which all of the meanings have been
distinguished.
That in the face of which one has anxiety is
characterized by the fact that what threatens is
nowhere. Anxiety ‘does not know’ what that in
the face of which it is anxious is. . . . it is so close
that it is oppressive and stifles one’s breath,
and yet it is nowhere. . . . [In anxiety] entities
within-the-world are of so little importance in
themselves that on the basis of this insignifi-
cance of what is within-the-world, the world
in its worldhood is all that still obtrudes itself.
What oppresses us is not this or that, nor is it the
summation of everything present-at-hand. . . .
Being-in-the-world itself is that in the face of
which anxiety is anxious. (BT 231–232)
“
Forum Day Three: Session Two 205
WES
That was the tip of the iceberg. Now we’re going to give you the opportunity to experience the
whole thing. It’s an exercise designed for you to really confront your fear of living and being
with people. You may hear people expressing it, crying. Allow yourself to be with your fear of
other people. If you really allow yourself to experience it, the depth of it may surprise you. You
have to be willing to take on what I’m asking you to consider and stand in it.
The next forty-fi ve minutes were devoted to the Danger Process. Participants were asked to remain
in their chairs with their eyes closed and to follow Wes’s instructions, as he directed them to
surround themselves, in their imaginations with an ever-widening circle of dangerous people. First,
he told them to imagine that they were afraid of the people sitting on either side of them. After a few
minutes, he said they should imagine—“create”—that they were afraid of the hundreds of people in
The Forum room. With each step, participants were urged to create the experience of fear, to “let the
experience up,” and with each step he allowed time for the fear to be generated.
As he continued, Wes expanded the fearful environment to include the entire population of San
Francisco, and then the 250 million people in the United States, and the world (circa 1989). As he
exhorted participants to create the experience of fear, people began to respond vocally with screams
and shouts. At fi rst these were isolated, but gradually the room became a cacophony of cries and
wails. Wes, already using a microphone, had to speak even more loudly to make himself heard over
the din, as he persisted in his instruction that people let the fear up, that they continue to create for
themselves this fear of other people.
This dramatic expression of fear continued at maximum pitch for some fi fteen minutes. As it began
to subside, a few laughs could be heard permeating the screams, and Wes spoke.
WES
There’s something on the other side of it, something to get. There’s a fundamental absurdity
about living. All those people you are afraid of? They are, in fact, afraid of you.
At this point he reversed the process and led participants back through the concentric circles, this
time pointing out that all of those people they’d been afraid of—the population of the world, the
country, of California, of San Francisco, the people in The Forum, the people sitting on either side of
them—were “just as afraid of you as you are of them. Making you the most dangerous person in the
world.”
WES (as the laughter diminished)
Going through this exercise is about allowing you to be with your fear, not to get rid of it. This
may enable you to be compassionate, now that you understand what people are going through,
including yourself. This won’t make the fear go away, but will allow you to be with it. It’ll still be
there, but it doesn’t have to stop you. Not overcoming it, not in spite of it, but allowing it to be.
If you didn’t get it, go out on a street away from the hotel, and when someone approaching you
is about 3 or 4 feet away, jump out and say boo!
But recall: Being-in-the-world, as the Being of Dasein, is not
something separate from Dasein itself. In anxiety, therefore, Dasein—
the “there” of Being-there, the clearing in-the-world for Being—comes
face-to-face with itself, and not conceptually, but directly. Thrownness
is disclosed as what it is—a situation with no significance, a world
that we inhabit because that’s where we showed up. It has us, and it
has no meaning. And that’s all there is to it.
Anxiety reveals the nothing. We “hover” in anx-
iety. More precisely, anxiety leaves us hanging
because it induces the slipping away of beings
as a whole. This implies that we ourselves—we
humans who are in being—in the midst of beings
slip away from ourselves... In the altogether un-
settling experience of this hovering where there
is nothing to hold onto, pure Da-sein is all that is
still there. . . . (“WM” in BW101, emphasis added)
“
The ‘world’ can off er nothing more, and nei-
ther can the Dasein-with of Others. Anxiety
thus takes away from Dasein the possibility of
understanding itself, as it falls, in terms of the
‘world’ and the way things have been publicly
interpreted. (BT 232)
“
And when Being-in-the-world is all there is, what gets revealed is that
In anxiety, the meanings of our everyday reality—the
interpretations of the they-self—fall away. “Anxiety reveals the
nothing” (“WM” in BW 101).

Participants who had not yet shared in The Forum were asked to share their experience of the
exercise.
PARTICIPANT
I was feeling my body all scared, and I felt like I didn’t want to be left alone. I like to pretend like
I’m okay when I’m alone.
WES
Do you see a new possibility for yourself?
PARTICIPANT
To let people know I’m afraid.
WES
Powerful people are afraid and have the power to communicate that when it would make a
diff erence. Thank you.

PARTICIPANT
I’ve always pretended to not be afraid. I remembered a childhood experience. I didn’t want to
go to school. I was afraid to do anything. I really am afraid of my children. I always have to be
strong. I didn’t cry when my dad died. I completely suppressed it. I’m willing to be with my
being scared.
WES
Great. Thanks.
(applause)
PARTICIPANT
I haven’t shared yet because I’m afraid. I got that it’s so ludicrous to be afraid of all these
people who are so afraid of me. I’m in a diff erent world now. I can see the faces out there, and I
couldn’t before. That wasn’t possible before.
WES
Thanks.

Anxiety throws Dasein back upon that which
it is anxious about—its authentic potentiali-
ty-for-Being-in-the-world. Anxiety individualiz-
es Dasein for its ownmost Being-in-the-world,
which as something that understands, projects
itself essentially upon possibilities. Therefore,
with that which it is anxious about, anxiety
discloses Dasein as Being-possible... Anxiety
makes manifest in Dasein its Being-towards its
ownmost potentiality-for-Being—that is, its
Being-free for the freedom of choosing itself
and taking hold of itself. Anxiety brings Dasein
face-to-face with its Being-free-for the authen-
ticity of its Being, and for this authenticity as a
possibility which it always is. (BT 232)
“
Anxiety as the abyss of nothing has morphed into anxiety as
a clearing for the freedom of possibility. This is the essential
movement of The Forum, hinted at persistently and in many
iterations throughout the conversation. This is the reflexive
rhetorical moment that will be achieved in its fullness by The
Forum’s conclusion, and for which the Danger Process has greased
the slide. In Heidegger’s terms, this is the event of appropriation.
In anxiety, we are confronted with the fundamental possibility
of our existence, because the people, things, and events which
usually have meaning for us are suddenly without significance.
Literally, they mean nothing: “When anxiety has subsided, then in
our everyday way of talking we are accustomed to say that ‘it was
really nothing.’ And what it was, indeed, does get reached ontically
by such a way of talking” (BT 231).
We call attention to Heidegger’s use here of the qualifier
“ontically,” which refers to facts and concepts within the realm
of beings. That is, it is conceptually accurate to say that what we

This is not about liberation. You should experience that suppression. Whatever you experience
is fi ne, really. Just continue to listen to the conversation in the room. And if you continue to
listen to the conversation in the room, it will continue to open up for you—what’s going on
with you. We’re a long way until the end of The Forum. Be here, now, in this conversation. The
Forum is too simple for complicated minds. The conversation going on in the room is more
powerful than your internal dialogue.

PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 7)
This is the fi rst time I really saw how scared to death I am of people in authority. My father
died when I was four years old, and my mother was a very strong and powerful woman. That’s
the bitch I can never get away from. If we did not do what she asked us to do, she would tie us
up and beat us with a stick, or with words. I saw that I can never be myself around people in
authority, because I am always afraid of being beaten or yelled at. And so I turn into a weasel
around authority and I can’t make straight requests, because when I asked my mother, I knew
it wouldn’t be accepted. And I couldn’t say no to her, ever. None of us could, there were three
of us. And the other side of it, that being able to see, really, that she was scared to death of me,
that she was scared to death that I would not do what she asked if she didn’t use force. Later on,
when you spoke about compassion, and I felt such deep compassion for all people in authority
who use force, because they’re really scared that if they don’t use force, you won’t do what they
are asking you to do. I’m standing in this huge possibility of really being with people who use
force and really being there and really acknowledging my terror of forty-nine years of stuff  has
disappeared.
WES
Thank you.
Wes announced a break. The assignment for the break: get a partner and complete your experience
of the exercise.
The Forum adjourned for a break at 4:00 pm.
fear in anxiety is “really nothing”; in saying this, the concept of
nothing has been reached. But what gives an experience of anxiety
its potential for self-revelation is that in such a state of mind we
reach nothing ontologically. And in this deeply experienced loss of
worldly significance there occurs, simultaneously, the possibility
of the clearing, the pure Being-openness which is Dasein. As
anxiety, the experience is unsettling; beneath and beyond lies the
possibility. But do not build up too much hope.
In the Danger Process, we can observe a clear instance of what
appears to be a symbiotic relationship between Erhard’s work and the
thinking of Martin Heidegger. This process was a central element of
the est Training from its inception, and consistently provided one of its
most dramatic components. But in The Forum, when that process is
placed within the framework of Heidegger’s model of Dasein, it gains
a new and empowering context; while at the same time, the in-the-
world power of Heidegger’s model is illuminated.
We note, however, that despite this aff inity between the
evocative aims of the two thinkers, on our view it would be
inaccurate to say that The Forum evokes an experience of anxiety
in participants. That term has denotative power in its use by
Heidegger, suggesting the aff ective extremity of the path to
ontological liberation. But the languaging of The Forum employs its
own vocabulary of hints, thereby providing an alternate ontological
path—equally extreme, but without the inevitable psychological
implications that currently accompany the concept of anxiety.
We assert that what distinguishes the transformation of
Erhard’s work from the majority of personal empowerment
programs—those that, in Erhard’s words, help people become
“more, better, or diff erent”—is its evocation of the Nothing. An
authentic experience of Being, said Heidegger, must begin by
doing violence to the “tranquillized obviousness” of the everyday
interpretation. Therefore The Forum works backward before it
moves forward; this is the heart of its genius. ■
208
SPEAKING BEING
meta ta phusika, which indicates a realm over beyond what naturally is. In the
metaphysical understanding of things that has developed in the West, Being has
been severed from its original relationship with beings, and has been relegated to
the over beyond, a loft y transcendental realm to which access is mysterious and, for
contemporary thinking, no longer even desirable. For the most part, human beings
are unaware that anything is missing. For us, says Heidegger, the “word ‘Being’ is
then finally just an empty word. It means nothing actual, tangible, real. Its meaning
is an unreal vapor” (IM 39–40).
From the inception of his work, Werner Erhard has engaged the public by
calling attention to this absence of Being, as in this 1982 presentation that he
delivered to some 20,000 people in audiences in nine cities:
“
and reality. I say that you and I live inside that gap, that there’s
a chasm, a gap, between what you and I expect of life and what
life really is. . . . I’m not talking about the gap between your
dreams and reality. I’m talking about the gap between what you
and I have a right to expect from life, and what we actually get
from life. See, you and I have a right to expect our relationships
to be deeply nurturing and really fulfilling, and for the most
part they’re not. . . . You and I have a right, when we go to work
for an organization, when we move from an individual expres-
sion to an organizational expression, we have a right to expect
our aff iliation with that organization to empower us, to make an
even bigger contribution than we could do as an individual. . . .
You know, we’ve got a right to expect certain things from the
government, and we don’t get it. Not fantasies. We have a right
to expect certain things from the practice of our religion, and
for the most part people don’t get it—what they have a right
to expect. And it’s all over the place. There is a gap. And it’s a
no-kidding gap. Something is missing. . . . And what [we—as the
they-self—are] providing is not allowing it to show up. (“Taking
a Stand for the Future”)
In responding to Being’s departure, both Heidegger and Erhard have focused their
eff orts on the design of a new language. Heidegger’s most frequently quoted claim
is that language is the house of Being (“LH” in BW 217). “In the word, in language,”
he said, “things first come to be and are” (IM 15). That is, the language of one’s time
SESSION TWO INTERVAL
The Forge tting of Being, Part Four of Eight: The Pre-Socratics
Martin Heidegger’s purpose as a philosopher was to think a way back to the
greatness which was promised at the beginning of Western history, but which has
remained unrealized due to the metaphysical tradition that has dominated human
understanding.
Historically, the term metaphysics has referred to the branch of philosophy that
dealt with questions about the nature of things, about ultimate causes and that
which does not change—questions, that is, about the nature of Being. This area
of philosophical inquiry is now generally designated as ontology. In the normal
course of events, most people, aside from academics and theologians, give little
or no thought to the subjects of metaphysics and ontology, or even to Being. But
Heidegger proposes that whether or not we are aware of it, the metaphysical
tradition is deeply embedded in the way we understand the world. In our everyday
lives, he says, this metaphysical understanding constrains our ability to be.
We remind the reader again as we begin this Interval that we are engaged in
an inquiry into something that is not something—that is, it does not fall within
the range of phenomena that are readily available for us to think about. In his
writing, Heidegger was persistent in his eff orts to indicate this mysterious aspect;
for example, in the text of one of his later books (The Event) the word “Being” was
repeatedly printed with a strikethrough. Here, the authors suggest that whenever
the word “Being” (in its capitalized form) occurs in our writing, it might usefully be
thought of as accompanied by a parenthetical question mark.
From the beginning of his career, Martin Heidegger’s work as a philosopher
was driven by the question of the human relationship to this mystery. According
to Hubert Dreyfus, a scholar with whom Werner Erhard consulted while creating
The Forum, Heidegger at some point had an experience of Being similar to the one
elicited by Erhard’s work, and he “struggled all his life to find an adequate language
to express it without falling, as he put it, into the ruts of metaphysics” (Assessment 2).
Over the years, his articulation of the being/Being relationship evolved significantly,
but his single-minded commitment to the question never wavered. At the heart
of the inquiry was his sense that modern human beings are out of touch with this
aspect of existence. It is as if, as Western culture has developed, Being has fled,
and a critical element of human experience has been lost.
The “ruts of metaphysics” mark the road Western thinking has traveled during
the millennia since the time of Plato. The word itself is derived from the Greek

and culture—the meanings, the values and standards, the art and the traditions,
the metaphors—make available a particular way of understanding the world, and
our lives are lived within the possibilities and limitations of that understanding. In
our current understanding, made available by the metaphysical tradition, Being has
been forgotten. In our world, there was no possibility of Being.
Therefore the work of both of these men was directed toward the creation
of new terminology; and one of the terms that has been central for Erhard, and
that has served the function of what might best be called “originary naming,” is
languaging (see the “Primordial Metaphor: Clearing” sidebar in Session Two of Day
Four). While the word language, as a noun, indicates a formal structure of words and
rules and the uses toward which they are commonly put within a given linguistic
community, “languaging” as a verb form indicates an action that is not merely
putting the words and rules of language to use. Languaging indicates the action of
generating new meanings, thereby creating new ways of understanding the world.
The creation of distinctions, which is the central element of The Forum, is a process
of languaging new contexts or clearings for understanding, which make possible
new ways of being and acting in the world.
For Heidegger, thinking a way to the presence of Being involved not only the
creation of a new vocabulary for the human condition, but also a thinking back
into history to discover how the earliest philosophers in Western culture languaged
their understanding of the world, and why this understanding devolved into the
ideas of the metaphysical tradition. Students of Western philosophy generally begin
their studies with Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle; these philosophers are the most
familiar to us because in their work we find the beginnings of our own tradition of
thinking. But there was an earlier group of thinkers in ancient Greece whose ideas
are in some ways at odds with that tradition, men in whose thinking a possibility
emerged briefly that was never thought again, and has since been forgotten. It is in
the writing of these men that Heidegger finds what he is seeking.
David Farrell Krell, in his introduction to Heidegger’s Basic Writings, tells us
that as a seventeen-year-old student, Heidegger read a German scholar’s thesis
(Franz Brentano) on Aristotle’s understanding of Being. The experience provoked his
thinking, and led him to seek out Aristotle’s own Metaphysics, where he found the
question that would guide him for the rest of his life: “The question that was raised
in earliest times, that we raise today and that will always be raised and will always
be a matter of perplexity [is]: ti to on, What is being?” (Aristotle, Metaphysics, VII, 3,
1028b, 2–4). Here Krell imagines Heidegger’s perplexity:
“
Had some Polonius asked the young man what he was reading
in his two books on “being,” he might well have answered,
“words, words, words.” German words from recent times trying
to translate Latin words from a bygone age that were trying to
translate Greek words from antiquity. But what were the Greek
words trying to translate? (Krell, “Introduction,” BW 5, emphasis
W
added)
It was this mystery that ultimately led Heidegger to his etymological explorations of
the earliest Greek philosophers. It puzzled him that although Aristotle’s writing had
been foundational in the development of almost every area of human intellectual
activity, his most profound question, while it had generated two thousand years
of scholarly disputation on the subject of ontology, seemed now to have lost its
meaning.
Heidegger’s focus in his quest was the work of those philosophers traditionally
known as the pre-Socratics—particularly Heraclitus and Parmenides—who lived and
wrote in the fift h and sixth centuries BCE. As Heidegger saw it, this brief historical
period was a particularly explosive time in the evolution of human understanding.
The pre-Socratics were not the first human beings to use language, but in
Heidegger’s view, they were the first to consider the diff erence it made that they,
among all beings, were the language-users; and they left  a written record of their
thinking, of which only fragments remain.
As the first philosophers of the West, these early thinkers made decisions about
the meaning of what they saw, and their decisions set Western culture on the path
which eventually evolved into the metaphysical tradition. “[W]e constantly return to
the Greek conception of Being,” says Heidegger, “because this conception, though
entirely flattened out and rendered unrecognizable, is the conception that still rules
even today in the West—not only in the doctrines of philosophy but in the most
everyday routines” (IM 64–65).
Therefore, to locate the source of this tradition and to discover how it might
have been otherwise, Heidegger has turned to the writing of those philosophers.
Their work survives only in brief fragments, but for Heidegger they provide
evidence of a crucial moment in the history of the West. They speak of “what since
ancient times is to-be-thought but is still unthought” (EGT 4). Here Krell, one of the
translators of Early Greek Thinking, characterizes the fragments:
210
SPEAKING BEING
“
Each is a truncated monument of thinking. Like the torso of a
river god or the temple of Poseidon at Sounion, each fragment
conveys a sense of loss, of tragic withdrawal and absence; yet
each is a remnant of an exhilarating presence. . . .  (EGT 4)
T
Only indirectly do the fragments indicate their subject matter. . . .
These merest fragments seem to talk about everything,
g all being,
g
whatever is. We moderns are convinced that this is nonsense. . . .
(EGT 7)
T
But Heidegger reads these words with the eyes of a man who is relentless in his
commitment to hear the language of Being; and what he has found provides us with
a new perspective on the way Western thought has understood the world for two
millennia (EGT Intro 5).
Is Heidegger’s understanding of pre-Socratic thinking credible? Is it persuasive?
His reading challenges the traditional translations, and as Krell acknowledges, his
interpretations are distressing, even violent:
“
Although Heidegger takes each word of the fragments
seriously—rather because he does so—his thinking plies a
dangerous, uncharted course which we are at pains to
follow. . . . But it is the violence inherent in any attempt to
cross over to that foreign shore, the violence by which we
overcome inertia and translate ourselves to the matter of
early Greek thinking. (EGT 11)
T
As we have noted in the last Interval (“The Forgetting of Being, Part Three of Eight”),
several scholars find Heidegger’s etymologies controversial, including one of his
recent translators, Richard Polt, who calls them idiosyncratic and oft en “fanciful,”
and wonders whether Heidegger is “so attracted to the pre-Socratics because
they survive only in fragments whose interpretation can easily be skewed in a
Heideggerian direction” (HI 133). But Polt nevertheless concludes that despite their
idiosyncrasy (or perhaps because of it), his readings succeed in shedding new light
on the tradition.
Heidegger reads the writing of the pre-Socratics to unconceal the language of
Being. As we will see, what he finds has substantial relevance for our inquiry into the
work of Werner Erhard.
