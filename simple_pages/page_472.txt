SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
You getting on with every other area except this one is not getting on at all.
(holding out both hands like the vanilla or chocolate choosing exercise)
Marriage, no marriage, choose. Choose!
AVRIL
No marriage.
KIPP
Okay, now what are we going to do? That’s complete.
AVRIL
Yeah, okay. I was great when I had that...
KIPP
What do you mean when you have that? You just chose it!
AVRIL
Right, but then I thought, but somehow, he doesn’t mean, that’s not what they mean by choice, 
because that’s what I got two years ago. And I got lit up about it...
KIPP
But then you got sucked right back into it.
AVRIL
Right, and then my husband comes back with, “You’ve got the marriage you’ve got, so stick 
with it.” And we’ve been going around and around for two years.
KIPP
The whole question is what are you willing to be responsible for in your life? Isn’t that it? You 
don’t quite want to be responsible for it. 
(referring to Vinny)
It’s like, he doesn’t want to be responsible for his own power, so he turns everybody else into an 
authority fi gure. Nobody wants to be responsible. It doesn’t come with being a human being. So 
you have to go on with this crap about your marriage. You’re either going to be married to him or 
not. Both of you are going to die, be buried in a box and have dirt thrown on your face. What’s all 
the racket about? What being a human being is about is generating sympathy. You’re going to get 
everybody sucked into your sympathy. Sympathy is between shit and syphilis in the dictionary.
(laughter)
But that’s what you sound like. Did you ever see puppies born? Kittens?
