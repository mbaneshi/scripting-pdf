Forum Day Four: Session Two

WES
And your solutions to problems, as rackets, are repetitive.
DONALD
I got another repetition. My mother never graduated from high school. She went to work
instead. She wanted us to go to university. It was a big thing in our family to go to university.
My mother really wanted all eleven of us to go to university, and I made my mother wrong by
dropping out. And so I get to be uneducated, to continue to make my mother wrong, and Dad
in there too. And so when she writes me letters... and tells me about my sister’s grades—like I
don’t give a shit about my sister—I wish she’d stop reminding me of her being about education,
because really she’s wrong. I really didn’t need to do that... So does that mean that in every prob-
lem that I have, I can see where I’m making someone wrong?
WES
Yeah.
DONALD
And if something happens, like if I lose my wallet, that’s not a problem and there’s no charge on
it, I could just go back to the store where I lost my wallet and get it back. So when something’s
there, there always has to be a lie for there to be stuckness...
WES
And whenever you lie, you lie for a purpose, to make someone or something wrong, to avoid the
domination of, to win, or to justify something: That’s why you lie. You lie to avoid the domina-
tion of something, someone, make someone wrong or make yourself right, win, avoid losing
and justify yourself and invalidating others. That’s why people lie. That’s the whole point of it.
DONALD
I caught myself lying on Wednesday, on Day One of this Forum, and I forget what process we
were sharing about, but I was saying that the airlines had messed up my fl ight, but what hap-
pened was more like a dance with the changing schedules.
WES
You were more committed to moving through the stops than you were to making something
wrong. If you were more committed to making something wrong, then that is what you would
have been engaged in, and you would have ended up with the problems that most people have.
DONALD
I was so committed to having it work that I called the offi  ce here in San Francisco to get the
address to send my bags here in case the fl ight got canceled again. I was committed to just have
it work. But then at the same time, I lied about it on the phone, complaining to someone that I
was stuck in Denver for three hours.

SPEAKING BEING
WES
Yeah, there’s nothing like a little sympathy along the way.
DONALD
You know the thing that I didn’t want to stand up and talk about was my weight because I
didn’t want to have eight hundred people come up and give me suggestions now.
(laughter)r
I think there’s like a stuckness that that creates.
WES (to the group)
Don’t give Donald suggestions.
DONALD
Okay, thanks, Wes. That’s it.
WES
Very good. Thank you.
(Donald sits to applause as Illiana stands)
What you want to be doing is looking at your problems and the payoff s to them.
ILLIANA
I’m trying to fi gure it out.
WES
Bad deal. Wrong deal.
ILLIANA
Okay. Just a second. My racket is that I want attention.
WES
What problem allows you to run the racket?
ILLIANA
Asking for attention.
WES
Is that the problem? Asking for attention?
ILLIANA
I have many diff erent problems on that basis.
“Way of Being” and the “Nature of Being for
Human Beings”
The following is an excerpt from the Pre-Course Reading Assign-
ment #5 from the Being a Leader Course (http://beingaleader.net)
as of fall 2015. In the manner in which this pedagogical document
opens up a way to distinguish the diff erence between “way of
being” for human beings, and the “fundamental and essential
nature of Being for human beings,” the authors find a further
development of Erhard’s work in The Forum (circa 1989) that both
continues to resonate with Heidegger’s thinking while experiment-
ing with new languagings of primordial metaphors.
What is Meant by “Way of Being”
In speaking about another person’s way of being you or I might
say, “She’s in a good mood,” or “That made him sad,” or “She’s
always cheerful,” or “He is an extrovert.”  We also sometimes simi-
larly think about our own way of being.
Our way of being is some combination of our mental state,
emotional state, bodily state, and our thoughts and thought pro-
cesses, and memories.  Or saying the same thing in more experi-
ential terms, our way of being is some combination of our attitude
or state of mind, and our feelings or emotions, plus our body
sensations, and our thoughts and memories.  For short, our way of
being is what is going on with us internally in a given moment or in
y
a given situation.
Note that the temporality of our way of being is what is going
on with us in a given moment or in
t
a given situation.  Even if a
certain way of being could be said to be our general or characteris-
tic way of being, none of us is always only the way we generally or
characteristically are.
Once you have checked out in your own experience what we
have said so far about way of being (and you should certainly do
that), what we have said becomes pretty obvious.  But, there are
two facts about our way of being that are at first perhaps not so
obvious:
