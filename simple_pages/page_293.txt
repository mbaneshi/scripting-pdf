Forum Day Three: Session Four

KEVIN
Sure.
ERHARD
Thanks.
KEVIN
Where was I? I was going to share my breakthrough.
ERHARD
You were going to share your “guess” breakthrough.
KEVIN
Now I’m not even sure what a breakthrough is. In any case, I feel like something happened. I 
don’t know.
WES
I don’t want to hear that. You’re either going to say there was a breakthrough, or you’re going to 
say there wasn’t a breakthrough. But there’s no guessing. There’s no maybe. There’s no place to 
look.
KEVIN
I had a breakthrough because something new and diff erent was happening to me that I hadn’t 
experienced before. 
WES
No, you had a breakthrough because you say so.
ERHARD
Kevin, breakthrough is a declaration phenomenon. Do you know the meaning of assertion? The 
commonplace meaning of assertion?
KEVIN
Yes. 
ERHARD.
Breakthrough is not an assertion. 
KEVIN
Okay.
ERHARD
It’s a declaration.
