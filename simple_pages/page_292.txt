SPEAKING BEING
KEVIN
I felt like I discovered something I didn’t know before.
WES (pointing to his mouth)
This is where the breakthrough happens. Right here.
ERHARD (coming forward)
Wait a second, this is something we need to handle here. Kevin, did you know that you are 
stingy? 
KEVIN
Well, that’s kind of a surprise.
ERHARD
I want you to wake up to that. You are stingy, my friend. You think you’re precise and careful, 
but you’re actually stingy. You mistake precision and care—which are laudable—for being 
stingy. You’re ungenerous. Not big. It does not enroll people into your view. It alienates people. 
They don’t fuck with you because you’re too careful and precise. But they don’t like you. It’s 
unattractive and it disempowers you. You’ve probably got something to give, but nobody will 
get it from you. People won’t “get” from stingy people. I don’t require that you discuss that with 
me.
KEVIN
I don’t mind discussing it with you, I just can’t really fi nd in my mind where I’m stingy because 
I don’t think that other people feel that I’m stingy. I’ve got other problems, but I’m searching to 
fi nd where I’m stingy and I don’t see it. 
ERHARD
And that’s what I want you to do. I want you to stay in the question tonight about being stingy. 
Are you married?
KEVIN
Yes.
ERHARD
Ask your wife.
(laughter)
I don’t mean stingy with money. I mean stingy with forwarding the action, stingy with 
contributing aliveness, stingy with empowerment. Ask your wife, or ask the people that work 
for you. Okay, please go on. I don’t mean to cut you off  on that, I just think that it’s more useful 
for you to take a look at it overnight, and if you’re wanting to discuss it further I am willing to 
do that tomorrow. Is that all right with you?
