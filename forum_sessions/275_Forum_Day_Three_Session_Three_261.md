experience at the moment, some people at this point are high. Some people are angry. Some
people are sad. Some people are ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the big deal?‚Äù
Wes had those in each category raise their hands. On the video each time Wes asked for hands, very
few went up until the last one: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the big deal?‚Äù
WES
It doesn‚Äôt mean anything. You can almost be assured that by the time dinner is over you‚Äôll be in
a diff erent experience anyway. It doesn‚Äôt mean anything.
ERHARD
Who in here knew that it was empty and meaningless? For a long time knew it?
(several participants raise their hands)
You have it like an answer, which is diff erent from how we are saying it here. It‚Äôs not a solution
to a problem, so you smart-asses didn‚Äôt get it.
WES
Let yourself be where you are. The other assignment: see if you have any questions about the
seminar program.
ERHARD
Up till now we‚Äôve talked about dog shit. Now we‚Äôre going to talk about the truth. The truth
about the truth is that it doesn‚Äôt mean anything. It‚Äôs just the truth. People do occasionally
stumble into the truth. Sometimes they fall over the truth. But they invariably suck the power
out of it, the truth-value out of it and turn it into an empty shell. And they do that by trying to
make the truth useful. The truth is useless. I mean that the truth does not justify anything. If
you stumble across the truth, or had a fl ash of insight, and you use it to explain something, if it
was true, it‚Äôs now not true, because you‚Äôve taken the truth out of the context in which it exists,
which context is useless, and put it into a context in which it cannot exist as the truth, which is
‚Äúuse.‚Äù The truth is useless. It gives no prescriptions. None. It‚Äôs never the basis for a rule, never
the basis for a prescription. The truth is useless. So anything you‚Äôre doing based on the truth is
based on bullshit. You don‚Äôt use the truth; the truth uses you. If you want to have a relationship
with the truth, be a place for the truth to go to work. Don‚Äôt try to use it, because when you try
to use it in any way, it loses its truth-value. If you want some evidence for that, look around the
world, and the places where you‚Äôll fi nd the greatest destruction, the most evil‚Äîthose things
were done in the name of the truth. Don‚Äôt fuck with the truth. Let it be. Let it use you. Let it be
and let it use you. Don‚Äôt try to use it. Because if you got lucky and you stumbled over the truth
and then tried to use it, you sucked all the truth-value that it had; all the power it had as the
truth is gone.*
If you stumble across the truth, or had a flash
of insight, and you use it to explain something,
if it was true, it‚Äôs now not true, because you‚Äôve
taken the truth out of the context in which it
exists, which context is useless, and put it into
a context in which it cannot exist as the truth,
which is ‚Äúuse.‚Äù

SPEAKING BEING
WES
Later you will have an opportunity to ask about the seminar, or about the visitor evening
tomorrow.
KIPP
How many of you have invited people to come tomorrow night at 9 pm? Use the dinner break
to invite those people.
WES
There are plenty of people there that you could complete with, that you could get off  it with.
Bonus category. Use the dinner break for that.
The Forum broke for dinner at 8:00 pm.

SPEAKING BEING
The Forgetting of Being, Part Five of Eight: Physis
To gain insight into the elusive nature of transformation, we are tracing the history
of Being, as unearthed by Heidegger in his reading of the Pre-Socratic Greek
philosophers. When Heidegger speaks of the Pre-Socratics, he oft en says simply ‚Äúthe
Greeks‚Äù; however, as we will show, the level of insight achieved by these thinkers
was not likely shared by the hoi polloi, the Greek population as a whole.
One of the tasks required by Heidegger‚Äôs project was to distinguish the original
meanings of words which, for the Greeks, said Being. Discerning these meanings
was an extraordinary challenge. According to Heidegger, the great thinking of these
philosophers was non-conceptual thinking, and therefore radically diff erent from
our current practice of reasoning, that is, comparing and contrasting propositions
that each state some relationship between a subject and its predicate. Subjects and
predicates are always and already generalized abstractions drawn from the particu-
larities of lived experience.
‚Äú
Concept and system alike are alien to Greek thinking. [...] The
interpretation of Greek thinking that is guided by modern
conceptual thinking not only remains inappropriate for Greek
thinking; it also keeps us from hearing the appeal of the prob-
lematic of Greek thinking, and thus from being held to a con-
stantly more urgent summons to go on questioning. (WCT 213)
T
Keep in mind that when we talk about a new way of thinking, we are introducing a
topic that cannot be brought to mind in our current way of thinking. So whatever
you thought when you read that phrase isn‚Äôt it.
Of the words used by the Pre-Socratics, none is more challenging than physis
(pronounced foo‚Äô-sis). What was said in this word, for the Greeks, was what Heideg-
ger calls the power that emerges. The original force of the word has been lost to us;
and it is the judgment of the scholar Charles E. Scott that if we can think physis as
the Greeks did, we will ‚Äúfind ourselves in an original dimension of our history,‚Äù one
that has been lost almost since its inception (A Companion to Heidegger‚Äôs Introduc-
(
tion to Metaphysics 26).
But to translate the Greek terms successfully, Heidegger insists, we must first
translate ourselves to the source of what comes to language in their saying. Since in
each pre-Socratic fragment the background from which it speaks is spoken as well,
we must ‚Äúseek the opportunity which will let us cross over to that source first of all
SESSION THREE INTERVAL
outside the fragment itself; it must be an opportunity which will let us experience
f
what ta onta [beings], thought in Greek, says‚Äù (EGT 28, emphasis added).
T
This book proposes that the transformational experience made available in The
Forum provides that opportunity. We show in this book that The Forum experience is
consistent in significant ways with the experience in language that Heidegger aimed
to evoke in his thinking. Further, since Heidegger is analogizing his understanding of
Being with the experience of the Pre-Socratics, we invoke the principle of transitive
equality and propose that The Forum, through its intentional dialogic transactions,
provides the opportunity called for in the passage above‚Äîit allows us to experience,
outside the Greek fragments themselves, the meaning of physis and ta onta.
Blossoming Emergence
Heidegger summarizes the complexity of physis here:
‚Äú
Now what does the word physis say? It says what emerges from
s
itself (for example, the emergence, the blossoming, of a rose),
the unfolding that opens itself up, the coming-into-appearance
in such unfolding, and holding itself and persisting in appear-
ance‚Äîin short, the emerging-abiding sway. . . . Physis is the
event of standing forth,
h arising from the concealed and thus en-
abling the concealed to take its stand for the first time. (IM 15-16)
M
This short but dense passage suggests the dynamic of physis‚Äîemerging, unfolding,
standing forth‚Äîas well as its complications. The word at once designates a process
(blossoming), the entity that emerges in that process (the rose), and finally the
phenomenon that comprises both the emergence and the rose itself, which is
named here the emerging-abiding sway. Note further that as the rose (the being)
emerges into unconcealment (the world), it brings with it the concealed from which it
has emerged‚Äîthe sway, the Being of the emergent being‚Äîand thereby brings what
has been concealed to stand ‚Äúfor the first time‚Äù in the world of meaning.
The word sway is a translation of Heidegger‚Äôs German word Walten. This is sway
in the sense of holding sway, by exercising rule or dominance over some realm.
But the term inevitably sounds overtones of persistent, back-and-forth vacillation,
a quality appropriate to any discussion of Being. In his writing about the Greeks,
Heidegger uses both physis and sway as designations for the realm of Being, and
sometimes he seems to be using them interchangeably. More oft en, however, the
terms serve to distinguish Being in two diff erent contexts, or stages. Of course, Being
cannot have a context, or anything at all like stages; but to talk about a topic that
cannot be talked about, one must tell some lies.
