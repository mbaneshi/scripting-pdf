SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (to laughter, making a gesture with his hands indicating the sex act)
I actually acknowledged that when Jake and I fi rst began to speak, that there’s a lot of accom-
plishment in this room. I didn’t call you an asshole because I didn’t know you were accom-
plished. I knew you were accomplished and I called you an asshole. Like Jake said: There’s a lot 
of satisfaction in what he does and there’s the possibility of a lot more satisfaction in what he 
does. That is what the asshole was about. It was not meant to denigrate you. It was said in full 
knowledge of your accomplishment. It was way more insulting than you thought, but it was 
not meant to denigrate. It was said in full knowledge that you’re accomplished and there’s a lot 
more there could be. 
JAKE
This has been a great experience. I stole a lot of the microphone—talking is another racket. I’ve 
got every racket in this room. And I think everybody else in this room have all the rackets...
ERHARD
Yeah: because they’re not your rackets. The racket is not yours. You are the rackets. The racket 
owns you; you don’t own the racket.
JAKE
I came in with a chip on my shoulder too. You invited us to speak there at the beginning. I 
thought I would ask a question that would really throw this guy about guests for the evening 
session, and the money. This experience was a genuine experience and I owe you an apology 
for that.
ERHARD
The apology is: You made this work for you. 
JAKE
I did.
ERHARD
That makes us even.
(applause)
KIPP
Okay, we’re about to go on a break. Standing in the empty and meaninglessness of life, see if a 
conversation for possibility, for participating in life... 
ERHARD
Let’s not give them an assignment at this point. Just stay with the empty and meaningless, we’ll 
talk about the rest of it when you get back.
