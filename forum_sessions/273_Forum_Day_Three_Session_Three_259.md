Forum Day Three: Session Three 259
MOLLY
What I got about my relationship with God? Well, my racket is that everyone abandoned me,
including God. You have to buy love. And I was told you had to serve God to make God happy
so he‚Äôd love you.
ERHARD (to the group)
Somehow, way back in history when all this God stuff  got started, God got turned into a story. I
invite you to consider the possibility that the story somehow served the transmission process in
those primitive times. This notion rings very hollow for me. Nevertheless, for people like you
and me to be living those stories is disgusting and sacrilegious. To reduce an infi nite possibility
into some crap story... That‚Äôs the end of my sermon.
MOLLY
I‚Äôve spent a lot of years serving.
ERHARD
The only time serving is nurturing is when you‚Äôre serving to serve, not serving in-order-to.
MOLLY
What I saw was that everybody was getting served except me, and I was getting exhausted.
ERHARD
I don‚Äôt know that being stuck with God is a good thing. Free to might be a more appropriate
relationship to God than have to.
(to Molly)
But that‚Äôs your business. My business is dog shit.
MOLLY
Apparently mine is too.
(laughter)
So when I saw that I had taken on this job to make God happy...
ERHARD (laughing)
Isn‚Äôt that ridiculous? This is a very good discussion. Go ahead.
MOLLY
And when I saw how ridiculous it was and how tired I was getting...
ERHARD
I got tired making God happy. It‚Äôs a new book. Look, you understand that Molly‚Äôs probably
produced more freedom in people‚Äôs relationship with God in the last fi fteen minutes than she
has in her whole life? She‚Äôs giving some room to be by sharing. She did it by sharing herself,
not her fucking platitudes, not her beliefs.
God
Here, Erhard is assuring that the ‚Äútrap‚Äù that The Forum sets for
participants‚Äîthe trap of the current paradigm, in which Forum
participants must find themselves hopelessly ensnared before
they can access the liberation of transformation‚Äîis experienced
as inescapable. Even God, for many still the most sacred of values,
must finally fall victim to the demands of standing-reserve. As
perceived through the metaphysical-technological lens of Western
thought, God is inevitably burdened with the entailments of
that paradigm. First, ‚ÄúHe‚Äù becomes an unattainable ideality (the
Creator who, in Heidegger‚Äôs view, is an extension of the Platonic
notion of ideal form); and, at the same time, ‚ÄúHe‚Äù is placed in
standing-reserve, along with everything else in the technological
clearing, and thus can be loved and worshiped only in-order-to‚Äî
that is, for salvation, forgiveness, eternal reward, and so forth. ‚ñ†

SPEAKING BEING
MOLLY
I saw that I wanted to end hunger to make God happy. And I saw that God was suffi  cient. I
mean, God was just doing fi ne.
(laughter and applause)
And it was a tremendous relief. I didn‚Äôt have to make God happy. I could do what I did just for
the joy of it.
ERHARD
Good.
WES
Got it. Congratulations.
Molly sat down.
WES
Here‚Äôs what I got from Molly: God‚Äôs happy. What‚Äôs your problem?
(laughter)
We‚Äôre going to dinner. That doesn‚Äôt change empty and meaningless. Let me point out the places
people are at at this point in The Forum. For some the possibility is very clear. Some don‚Äôt
know exactly what is happening. Some are very sure they‚Äôre not in tune with what‚Äôs happening.
Recognize places you are in.
ERHARD
He means possibility like an opening, like freedom, not like an answer... You want to get that
real clear in here, because I know you‚Äôve been hearing possibility like an answer. We do not
mean possibility as an answer, but a clearing in which life can happen. You can‚Äôt dance with
answers. You dance with freedom. You can‚Äôt paint knowing how to paint, knowing the answers.
You‚Äôve got to have an openness, room.
WES
So you‚Äôre in diff erent places with regard to the conversation. I invite you to go to dinner in a
group.
ERHARD (regarding the approaching dinner break)
You notice you‚Äôre a little less frenzied about dinner? Like dinner might be just dinner, rather
than a chance to get away.
WES
At dinner, have a conversation about where you are in The Forum. Not your opinions, ideas,
and notions: something about where you are and what you see in your life. Continue to stand
in this conversation. You don‚Äôt need to go anywhere. Let it unfold for you. With regard to your
