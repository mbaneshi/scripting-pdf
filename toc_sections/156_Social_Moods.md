SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
You made yourself into ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not smart enough to sweep.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt true; It wasn‚Äôt false: Because
that‚Äôs not something that‚Äôs true or false. It‚Äôs just something you became.
MIKE
Okay.
ERHARD
What‚Äôs the payoff  in becoming that?
MIKE
I didn‚Äôt have to try any harder, so I gave up.
ERHARD
One of the payoff s was, you avoided the responsibility of having to produce the result. You
avoided the domination of the responsibility for producing. Your brothers and sisters were dom-
inated by the need to produce. You avoided that domination.
MIKE
Correct.
ERHARD
Good. When did you fi rst have this conversation about being stupid?
MIKE
Eight or nine years old.
ERHARD
What happened that that became a conversation?
MIKE
Another time I was sweeping, I missed a spot.
ERHARD
And you became stupid at some point. You‚Äôve got as much sense as anybody does. You started
being stupid when you were eight or nine years old as a way of dealing with what was going on
with your dad. It‚Äôs a way of being you took on. What other payoff s are there?
MIKE
I didn‚Äôt have to fi ght my dad back in fi ghting that I was stupid.

ERHARD
You avoided the domination of your father by giving in.
MIKE
Right.
ERHARD
How much energy did your father put into fi xing you?
MIKE
He kept pointing out all the wrong things I did.
ERHARD
So you dominated your dad by getting him attached to your stupidity, right? Like Brer Rabbit.
That was his relationship to you, trying to deal with your stupidity.
MIKE
When he was trying to correct me.
ERHARD
What other payoff s did you get out of being stupid? Did you get to be right? Did your father get
to be wrong?
MIKE
I got to be right about being dumb.
ERHARD
Did you identify strongly with your father?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
So you made what you identifi ed with right.
MIKE
Correct.
ERHARD
What did it cost you to have a racket called being stupid?
MIKE
I stopped talking with my dad.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
So there was a loss of relationship?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
A certain loss of love.
MIKE
Loss of my self.
ERHARD
You lost self-expression. You cut off  that avenue of self-expression called intelligence.
MIKE
Okay.
ERHARD
What about happiness?
MIKE
I was sad that I couldn‚Äôt make my dad happy.
ERHARD
Got it.
MIKE
I still don‚Äôt understand why the whole crowd was laughing at the beginning.
ERHARD
I don‚Äôt know. Why were they laughing at the beginning?
KIPP
They laughed when he stood up and said he didn‚Äôt know what his racket was.
ERHARD
Mike, you‚Äôve been in here for a little while right? People thought I was insulting when I called
them assholes. That was like a ‚Äúdamned with faint praise,‚Äù not an insult. Asshole is a fairly high
level. People are really stupid. Are you tuned in?
