Forum Day Four: Session Three 475
SHERYL
Yes.
ERHARD
That’s the point.
ERHARD
You and I dwell in, you and I come from, you and I are that the source of action is something
inside of people. Is that clear? Like I said before, this is a corollary, a harmonic, an “also.” I’m
going to tell you what I said before because it’s an “also”: That there’s a world out there that is a
certain way and that my job is to get the representation of the world in here...
(pointing both hands at his head)
...which is accurate because I act out of the representation in here on what’s out there. And if
my representation is accurate I will be eff ective in acting with what’s out there. Is that clear?
You don’t think that; you don’t need to: You are that. You are that there’s a world out there, like
an is world: The world is like this. And it isn’t like that. And my job is to get the representation
in here or here,
(pointing to his head and then his heart)
or wherever you think representations are, and my job is to get it out in the world out there
accurately. And some people have more wisdom and more knowledge and more insight than
others. And there are those of us who are arrogant enough to think that we have a special
perspective on the world that allows us to see it rightly: “Those other fools who have just got
it wrong because they’ve got the wrong perspective. Now I’ve got it right, you see?” At any
rate, it’s all the same thing. It’s all that my actions are a product of what I know, or of my
experience, but something inside of me, or the qualities I have. You know, smart, talented,
whatever it is; or stupid, clumsy. You see, clumsy is a quality inside people, isn’t it? They walk
around with it. It’s ready to put to use whenever they need it. That’s the way you and I are
that it is. You and I are that it is like that. Is everybody clear about that now? And then the
corollary: There’s a world out there that is a certain way—what I call an is world—can you
hear “is world”?—an is world rather than a made-up world. There’s an is world; it is a certain
way—and my job is to get a representation in here that’s accurate because I act out of what’s
in here. If what’s in here is accurate then I’ll be eff ective with what’s out there. Does anybody
not get that?
(pausing)
So now we’re going to do a demonstration to look at the source of action, and we’re going to
fi nd out that the source of action is not in here. So I say that the source of action is not in here,
that you don’t have any qualities in you at all. All you’ve got is entrails. Guts. Goop. That’s
what’s inside. Now that’s aff ronting, isn’t it? That’s aff ronting to who you are, because you
are that there’s something inside called qualities and experience and talent and know-how
and intelligence: because that’s the standard interpretation which you are. So I’m saying this
present and so becomes the highest being pres-
ent. [. . .] Ultimately, presencing as such is not
distinguished from what is present: it is taken
merely as the most universal or the highest of
present beings, thereby becoming one among
such beings. The essence of presencing, and
with it the distinction between presencing and
what is present, remains forgotten. The oblivion
of Being is oblivion of the distinction between
Being and beings. (EGT 50)
But Heidegger hastens to add:
However, oblivion of the distinction is by no
means the consequence of a forgetfulness
of thinking. Oblivion of Being belongs to the
self-veiling essence of Being. [. . .] This means
that the history of Being begins with the
oblivion of Being, since Being—together with
its essence, its distinction from beings—keeps
to itself. The distinction collapses. It remains
forgotten. (EGT 50)
“
Here, some light is shed into the clearing of our question: why does
the experience of transformation that is made available in The Forum
occur as perpetually elusive?
What gradually became forgotten was Being’s other aspect:
its nature as emerging, its presencing and withdrawal, the not-
Being which is always the other side of Being. Beings became
understood as permanent presence; lost was the recognition
that the maintenance of the originary power of Being depended
upon the persistence of the struggle, so that the event is
continuously regenerated. Unconcealment is not a once-and-for-all
accomplishment:

SPEAKING BEING
counter—commonsensical, counter—“what everybody knows” thing: I’m saying “no, that’s
not the source of action.” We’re going to do a demonstration to see if we can actually get some
insight into the true source of action. What we need is somebody who’s clumsy.
Erhard called on a participant named Ellen, who then mounted the platform.
ERHARD
Thank you. You’ve got to be a little brave to be clumsy, because clumsy is not in.
ELLEN
That’s my racket.
ERHARD
We’re going to play catch in order to demonstrate clumsy, okay?
Erhard and Ellen stood at opposite ends of the platform. Erhard began to toss her a tennis ball. She
caught it several times.
ERHARD
I’m going to make it a little bit harder, because you’re less clumsy than you thought. And they
need to see “clumsy,” so I’m going to bounce the ball in front of you.
Erhard bounced the ball in front of her, and after a few times, she failed to catch the ball to laughter
from the group.
(continuing)
Wait, wait, wait. Missing the ball is not “clumsy.” That’s just missing the ball. The way you deal
with the ball, that’s where clumsy is... Now we’re going to stop playing catch. We’re going to
play a new game called “Which way is the ball spinning?” So you’re going to tell me which way
the ball is spinning, and it doesn’t make any diff erence whether you catch the ball this time or
not.
Erhard threw the ball repeatedly. Ellen caught it some of the time and missed it some. Each time she
reported which way the ball had been spinning, and then tossed it back each time.
(continuing)
So you did that demonstration perfectly. Thank you, you’re wonderful.
Ellen returned to her seat, and Erhard addressed the group.
(continuing)
I started to throw the ball in places that were uncomfortable for her. She also started to use
her body, and to step back to make it easier to catch, instead of stepping forward, which is an
inappropriate reaction but a natural one for someone to whom the ball appears uncatchable.
standing-forth; it alone also preserves beings
in their constancy. Where struggle ceases, be-
ings indeed do not disappear, but world turns
away. . . . Beings now become just something
one comes across; they are findings. [. . .] To be
sure, beings are still given. The motley mass of
beings is given more noisily and broadly than
ever before; but Being has deserted them. (IM
68-69)
“
Language is the house of Being, so language is the site of the
struggle. Being deserts beings when their Saying becomes only
talking, a speaking “in which no world is worlding any more. . .
That which originally holds sway, physis, now degenerates into a
prototype for reproduction and copying” (IM 68-69).
Here Heidegger distinguishes two ways in which appearing
may be understood, which we examined in “The Drift ” sidebar in
Session Two of Day Four, and which we repeat here in an attempt
to open up the space newly: “First, appearing denotes the self-
gathering event of bringing-itself-to-stand and thus standing in
gatheredness. But then, appearing also means: as something
that is already standing there, to proff er a foreground, a surface,
a look as an off ering to be looked at” (IM 203, emphasis added).
Appearing, in its first and “authentic” sense, “rips space open. . .
it first conquers space; as standing there, it creates space for
itself.” Appearing in the second sense “merely steps forth from an
already prepared space, and it is viewed by a looking-at within the
already fixed dimensions of this space” (IM 203-204). Appearing
in the second sense may be characterized as dogma, or received
wisdom, or relating to the self or others as possessing “qualities,”
such as being “stingy” or being “big.” In Werner Erhard’s work, this
distinction is also developed in the term sharing: to share one’s self
in communication is to conquer the space—to create context as
one speaks, and in such a way that shift s the way the world occurs,
with which our actions are correlated.
But here is the tricky part of this distinction: appearing that
rips space open is always ripping space open. Otherwise it would
