SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Sure. So it makes the conversation a bit hard for you to hear. But now that we’ve said that let’s
do what you asked to have done and take a deeper look.
SUZANNE
Yes.
ERHARD
So, did it make sense—was it valid for you—what I said that you and I and everybody else,
as little girls or boys, had experiences in which it’s entirely logically, so powerfully logical, so
predictable that we’re going to conclude that there’s something wrong, that we could all accept
that at some point in our childhood we did conclude that there’s something wrong here? Or was
that the logic you were questioning?
SUZANNE
I’m not going to add to that statement. That’s a period. There’s something wrong here. But in
addendum you said “there’s something wrong here and the achievement is there.” That premise
is correct.
ERHARD
Okay good, I’m just trying to fi nd out where the sticking point is.
SUZANNE
I agree with that premise.
ERHARD
So then I said that it’s not a mere conclusion, I said that you become that there is something
wrong. You are that there is something wrong. You know, you’re a four-year-old, a fi ve-year-
old, and become that there’s something wrong and it becomes the shaping ground of being for
everything you built. See, you built a Suzanne, and I built a Werner, and he built whoever he is.
And I did it over years. I had a certain aspect of me built by the time I was fi ve. I had another
aspect of myself built by the time I was nine. By the time I was seventeen I was pretty much
built. Everything I’ve done since I was seventeen has been additive. I’ve gotten a little better, or
a lot better at those things I was good at, or the things I could be good at. In any case, around
that age, seventeen or twenty, they’ve built their persona, they’ve built an identity, they’ve built
a self. Okay, I said that that self that I built was built in response to the ground of being called
there is something wrong here.
SUZANNE
For this moment I will accept that and think about it.
ERHARD
Okay. Let me just give you one thing. That’s an assertion. And an assertion deserves evidence,
because an assertion is a promise that I’ve got evidence. So I’m going to give you my evidence.
Forum Day Three: Session Four
299
My evidence is that your best and my best moments, my talents, the “what I’m good at,” the
“what I can be counted on”—including getting married, a good moment; having children,
raising children, a good moment; doing well in my job, a good moment: I’m talking about
the stuff ... I use to generate achievement. The exercise of that does not leave me full, whole,
complete, full of joy. It’s gratifying. God knows that whenever I have an accomplishment, I feel
great: a couple of moments, a couple of hours, a couple of days, a couple of weeks, maybe even
a year. But at some point I’m back to: that wasn’t enough.
SUZANNE
So where is the satisfaction?
ERHARD
The level of satisfaction is that there’s no full satisfaction. There’s no being complete with life.
One is always incomplete. It’s the conversation we had earlier about someday. See, someday,
someday I’m going to contribute enough, achieve enough, to have made it. No. Because
every accomplishment makes the context—there’s something wrong here—bigger, more
stronger, more valid, all that below the level of awareness. See up at the level of awareness I’m
developing myself and being a decent human being and making some sort of contribution,
and taking care of myself and taking care of the people around me. That’s all content, that’s all
foreground. The context, the background, which is reinforced by every achievement, is “there
is something wrong here.” What that leads to is never being satisfi ed. Ever. Never being full of
joy. Never. Never being complete never being whole. Life is always incomplete. And life is lived
as a struggle to be complete, to fi nally be satisfi ed. So that’s my evidence. It doesn’t prove what I
said, because you can’t prove an assertion. But it does validate it.
SUZANNE
So it’s best to assume that in anything we do we have that, we don’t get satisfi ed. There’s more. I
should assume that there should be more.
ERHARD
I’m not saying you should assume that, I’m saying we live like that. You and I and the other
eight hundred people sitting in this room and the other half a million people that I’ve
worked with.
SUZANNE
So that follows the logic that life is meaningless and empty, and therefore if life is meaningless
and empty, it is zero. Zero.
ERHARD
I don’t want to make the conclusion you made. Yes, what we are saying here is entirely
harmonic with that life is meaningless and empty. You see it got to be pretty clear that
everybody’s soap opera was bullshit, meaningless and empty, now I want to get it clear that the
rest of it is bullshit: the good parts. I want you to see where they come from. So that you get that
the whole thing is meaningless and empty. It’s not that I want it to be that way. It is that way.

SPEAKING BEING
SUZANNE
Yes. I get you.
ERHARD
Thank you very much.
(returning to The Forum leader who had shared about living life in order not to be embarrassed)
What did you say to get us started down this conversation with Suzanne? Is there anybody left
that doesn’t get that as you built the content called accomplishment and contribution, you are
reinforcing the context for that contribution, which context is “there’s something wrong.” Is
that clear for everybody?
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 8)
So I wouldn’t be so foolish as to ask how to get out of this predicament.
ERHARD
Yeah, because you don’t.
PARTICIPANT (Forum Leader 8)
I’m too smart I guess.
ERHARD
You see: What do you do about being dead?
(laughter)
Nothing. See it’s not a bad thing to know that you’re dead when you’re dead. You lie down.
You know that there are some dead people in the room? There are actually some dead people
in here–walking around bolt upright, dead though. There are people in here who have killed
themselves. They didn’t kill their bodies, they killed their selves. Their bodies walk around but
they are dead. There are dead people in here. You might even fi nd out that you were dead. That
would be good news because then you could lie down and relax.
(laughter)
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 9)
So one of the surprises for me in this Forum is that yesterday I saw that my racket is that I’m a
victim...
ERHARD
This is very surprising to hear from a guy like this. Very accomplished, very able guy.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 9)
And I’ve always disliked victims. So other than, so tonight for dinner, after the series of
meetings I ended up that there was nobody to go to dinner with, and the violins begin to come
Forum Day Three: Session Four
301
out. And true to what you said yesterday it occurred to me that this was me running my victim
racket. I laughed at myself for a moment. And then I went to fi nd some people to go have
dinner with.
ERHARD
See, hold on a second. He’s a little bit ahead of us. I almost wish he didn’t say that because now
he’s leaked out the truth, and you’ll latch on to that real fast. That’ll be the new prison bars.
When you get that it’s empty and meaningless you see things you’ve never seen before. As long
as you’re stuck with your soap opera you can’t see those things. For instance, if who you are is
that people are unable, you can’t see the opportunities to develop their ability. And you can’t
see their ability. As soon as you get that that’s your racket, as soon as you get that whole soap
opera that you’ve got to do everything your self because there’s nobody around able enough to
do it, you begin to see things you didn’t see before. Now, I shouldn’t have told you that, you see,
because you’ll spend the whole night trying to fi gure out how to get out of the trap. And you’ll
come in here tomorrow all stuck in the trap again. We’ll have to spend the whole day getting
you out of the trap. And then we’ll have to do an extra day of The Forum with you all. Go ahead.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 9)
So I’m actually not going to ask the question now. But what I have gotten, and just to share,
one is that some people’s coaching for me recently is to take myself a little less seriously and I
can hear the room to be that way now. Secondly, is I’ve been able to share myself with people,
Werner, not like something happened.
ERHARD
To speak himself. Not in-order-to.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 9)
I can see as a graduate, staff  member, and Forum leader candidate, that that’s probably
something for all of us to take on, the sharing in-order-to business.
ERHARD
Good. Thank you.
(applause)
ALEX
What about a child who’s been told everything’s right?
ERHARD
That’s called Skinner’s “glass box,” and Skinner already demonstrated that it doesn’t work. Did
you get my answer?
ALEX
Yes.
“
For instance, if who you are is that people
are unable, you can’t see the opportunities
to develop their ability. And you can’t
see their ability. As soon as you get that
that’s your racket, as soon as you get
that whole soap opera that you’ve got to
do everything your self because there’s
nobody around able enough to do it, you
begin to see things you didn’t see before.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
The other answer is that you don’t actually get that from what happens, you’re already always
that as a human being. In other words, you are “there is something wrong here” waiting to
happen. See listen, if we had the time, and we don’t—that’s another program—I would get up
enough people in here whose experience was almost always what you and I would call positive.
The athletic kids, the successful kids, the right kind of families. And you would fi nd out that
they had somehow fucked that up. It’s amazing. Hard to believe. There are people in here like
those kids we grew up with that we thought had it all. People like that in here. And if they stood
up and shared with you, they would tell you that it was bad.
ALEX
Yeah.
ERHARD
So there’s no way to escape it. Even if you’re told “you’re wonderful,” “you can have anything
you want,” “life is great.” Now, that is preferable over being told that you’re shit. No question
about that.
ALEX
That is my question. Is that preferable?
ERHARD
Oh sure. It’s kind of like carrying less baggage. You’re still going to carry the baggage. You’re
still going to get into the trap. You can’t keep your kids out of the trap.
ALEX
The kid is told “You can do anything you want to,” or the parent gets that child in as much
diffi  culty as to tell the child they’re worthless. Is it in the same elevator shaft, or is it diff erent?
ERHARD
That’s correct. I’ve looked at it as far as I can see it, and yes. But it’s too long of a conversation to
have right now.
LUCY
Two things. One I found this conversation the most powerful for me personally. The experiences
that I heard are very applicable to me.
ERHARD
One will hear oneself in other’s sharing.
LUCY
I think I understand why I don’t get a sense of fulfi llment out of the many things that I...
Forum Day Three: Session Four
303
ERHARD
Sure because you’re an accomplished person.
LUCY
I am trying to avoid something, that feeling that something is wrong. But the next question that
comes to mind is what is the strategy to fi x that? And you said you don’t fi x it.
ERHARD
No you don’t.
LUCY
But I don’t agree with that.
ERHARD
It’s not that you don’t agree with that. You are addicted to fi xing it.
LUCY
That’s true.
ERHARD
You have to have an answer.
LUCY
Not an answer, but to fi nd a way to fi x it, and then fi x it.
ERHARD
Yeah. You and Suzanne ought to get together. These are two achievement nuts. You can’t fi x it.
LUCY
Why not?
ERHARD
Well, you tell me how to fi x being dead and I’ll tell you how to fi x it.
LUCY
Well a lot of things are one’s frame of mind and how you think things...
ERHARD
That’s not true. A lot of things are explained using the terminology of the frame through which
you look at things. Like positive thinking. Good stuff . What kind of a person would need to
think positively?
LUCY
Somebody who’s kind of negative.
304
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Yeah. Every time you think positively, that is the content. The context is negative, that you are
a negative person. Life is negative. No kidding. I’ve done that whole achievement thing for
quite a while. Made a lot of money doing that. Lot of money. That whole business about being
successful and achieving, and positive thinking. You name it I did it. And it works. The problem
is that it’s never enough. Never fulfi lled, never whole. What you’re asking me is how to get out
of the trap and the answer is that the attempt to get out of the trap is what keeps you in the trap.
I want you to think about this tonight. This is hard to get. Because getting out is supposed to get
you out. In this case getting out keeps you in. This is a very strange kind of prison. The bars are
not made of iron. They are made out of the attempt to get out of the prison. So Lucy, tonight, I
want you to see if you can come to accept that you’re going to have to live the rest of your life in
this prison.
LUCY
I have another question. The concept... life is empty and...
ERHARD
I don’t talk in concepts. Distinctions.
LUCY
I’m trying to relate how we can apply it to our lives.
ERHARD
You cannot apply it. Worthless, useless information.
LUCY
Then what’s the purpose in knowing that? Or accepting that?
ERHARD
Because it’s the truth.
LUCY
But how can knowing that or accepting that create personal power for us?
ERHARD
So wonderful. Hold on one second, I’ll be right back.
(to the group)
Lucy and I are going to demonstrate terminally that you are addicted to the answer, that you are
addicted to getting out, to getting the answer. That no matter how many times I’m going to tell
you that the attempt to get out is the bars of the prison, you’re going to spend the rest of your
life trying to get out. She’s going to demonstrate the very thing I’m talking about; she’s going to
demonstrate that she’s going to spend the rest of her life trying to get out. And nothing I tell her
is going to stop her. There are no answers. You don’t get out. It’s not going to work out. It’s not
