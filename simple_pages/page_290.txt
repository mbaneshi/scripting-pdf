SPEAKING BEING
that you say so, you do get nutty about it instead of having fun. So yeah, your twenty-six things: 
wonderful as long as they belong to you.
FRED
I just had the thought standing up here, that if I have so many things going on then I can avoid 
domination. Because I could always say “I’m too busy. I’ve got this meeting to go to so I can’t go 
to this other meeting.”
ERHARD
Lots of people too busy to do anything. Who in here is too busy to do anything? “I don’t get to 
accomplish anything because I’m too busy.” 
FRED
I gave up the twenty-six items and I saw that there’s no satisfaction in them. I’m driven to them, 
and there’s no sense of empowerment. So I’m actually looking at the wonder of complacency. 
That it might be just wonderful to go home and watch TV, have a beer and forget about my 
twenty-six items. There might be more authenticity in relaxing, watching TV with a beer than 
scrambling after my twenty-six items. 
ERHARD
Yeah, and neither one of them is going to get you anyplace.

And you’re actually going to do what you’re going to do anyhow, not what you contemplate 
doing. You haven’t got much choice about it. In fact, none. You can only do what you do; you 
can’t do what you don’t do. As soon as I fi nd someone who has done what they didn’t do, we’re 
going to stop doing The Forum because it’ll be bullshit. So far, looking through half a million 
people, we haven’t found anybody who did what they didn’t do. Everyone’s only done what 
they did.
(to another participant sitting)
Get that? You ever do anything you didn’t do? You only do what you do, right? 
PARTICIPANT
I do what I want to do.
ERHARD
You do what you want to do?
PARTICIPANT
Always.
ERHARD
Always?
ERHARD (continuing)
