Forum Day Four: Session Three 527
Kipp proceeded to review the logistics and procedure of the evening, including a play-by-play
recounting of what will happen, including having an opportunity to share during the evening
session, right at the beginning, when The Forum Leader presents the opportunity to share.
KIPP (continuing)
...and I invite you to not hold back, to create for yourself and the people that you have there,
having possibility in your life and in their lives... Now, I‚Äôm going to tell you everything you
need to know to share The Forum eff ectively and have your friends and family do The Forum.
It‚Äôs very simple and it‚Äôs very straightforward. So if you‚Äôre committed to sharing The Forum
and having people at your Forum Evening Session and having them register, the fi rst thing
is this: Do not sell The Forum. Simply be straight with the people in your lives. Say whatever
The Forum is for you. Whether you think it‚Äôs great or whether you‚Äôre not sure, whether you‚Äôre
confused, or if you think it was stupid, or whether you are totally enthusiastic with a thousand
breakthroughs. Whatever it truly is for you, authentically share that. Don‚Äôt sell The Forum.
Because what people listen to is not what you say. People listen to who you are being. The
second thing is, it serves the people who you are bringing for them to know there will be an
opportunity for them to register, so they should bring their schedules... and they should bring
money with them. Be straight with people. That‚Äôs what works. The last thing is this: When you
walk out of here and share The Forum, that is, share your self, you will be speaking into the
listening of the world. You already know what that listening is. When you share yourself, people
will think it‚Äôs a racket, it‚Äôs a cult... When you speak, people will have those thoughts. Everybody
clear? People will have those thoughts.
(Kipp grabs a tissue and holds it up; laughter)
Don‚Äôt get stuck with their thoughts. Don‚Äôt get stuck with your own. What there is to do is
simple. Okay?
Kipp grabbed the dictionary from a table on the platform, and he asked a participant to stand up on
the stage with him.
KIPP (addressing the participant)
When sharing The Forum with anyone, what‚Äôs the worst thing they could say to you?
ED
‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre stupid and weird.‚Äù
KIPP
So this dictionary represents ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre stupid and weird.‚Äù Resist it.
Kipp light-heartedly attacks Ed over and over with the dictionary repeating ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre stupid
and weird‚Äù with each attack, and Ed defl ects each attack with upraised hands.
KIPP (to the group)
For the most part that‚Äôs what you call communication.

(laughter)
Here is what to do when people say that stuff  to you.
(to Ed)
This time take the dictionary.
(as Kipp attacks once more)
‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre stupid and weird.‚Äù
(Ed takes the dictionary away)
That‚Äôs your job. So when people say that stuff , your job is to be with them. Chocolate: choose.
When you get a whole big pile of dictionaries, we turn around and put them down, and say,
what else you got? Peacocks are these gorgeous birds. Do you know what peacocks eat? They
eat poison off  the ground. If you want to make a diff erence in people‚Äôs lives, you‚Äôve got to be
willing to eat their poison. Thank you Ed.
(Ed sits to applause)
And, you‚Äôre going to get stuck with some dictionaries. You‚Äôre going to notice in the middle of
a conversation with somebody, all of a sudden, you‚Äôll be resisting what they are saying. You
notice that in the middle of a conversation, you can say, ‚ÄúI got hooked. Here‚Äôs what I want to
say.‚Äù I invite you not to stop. You can make a real contribution to the people in your lives this
weekend. Another thing: Whatever emergencies come up for you, whatever can normally stop
you in life, don‚Äôt get stopped. Be at your Forum Evening Session, and complete The Forum for
yourself.
The fourth day of The Forum ended.

in order to speak a language which communicates Being, one must speak from an
ontological location, a clearing, which provides access to Being.
The second question asks: how does the dialogic rhetorical structure of The
Forum achieve ontological transformation?
The Forum as an instance of ontological rhetoric‚Äîthat is, rhetoric which
communicates strategically so as to produce a shift in its audience‚Äôs way of Being.
What are the central functional characteristics of ontological rhetoric, as they
have been developed in this book? Fundamental to ontological rhetoric is the
communication of an unsaid element of language. That is, both Heidegger and
d
Erhard hold that Being is a region or horizon which pervades and contextualizes
language, but which cannot itself be articulated. Nevertheless, while Being must
remain unspoken, it can nevertheless be brought to presence by means of a certain
kind of speaking; Heidegger proposed that a dialogue which is conducted in a
certain way can function to bring Being to presence for dialogic partners. Therefore,
The Forum is an attempt to design and enact a dialogue which brings Being to
presence as an unspoken element of a spoken conversation.
In order for Being to be brought to presence, an ontological shift must occur, a
t
transformation in the way human beings conceive themselves. According to Heidegger,
the presence of Being requires a clearing; in our current way of thinking and being,
however, the clearing which human beings are is obscured by the normative self-
structure which we call identity, or the ‚Äúthey‚Äù self and its current technological
way of Being. Therefore, much of The Forum is devoted to the deconstruction of
identity and its in-order-to, so that participants can begin to see themselves as a
different ontological entity: a clearing for Being from which it becomes possible to
appropriate one‚Äôs inauthenticity. Furthermore, from this event new possibilities
for Being arise, and as they are languaged, the world as it occurs transforms and
takes us along with it. This process of ontological deconstruction and invention is
posited in The Forum as a process that occurs entirely in language: The Forum is
a dialogic enactment of Heidegger‚Äôs thesis that ‚Äúlanguage is the house of Being.‚Äù
It creates the conditions for ontological transformation by engaging participants
in the speaking of a new language, a language grounded in certain ontological
assumptions (Erhard‚Äôs distinctions, the figures of speech and thought which
comprise his technology of transformation). During the four days of this 1989 Forum,
as participants engage in the dialogue and speak its language, they gradually come
to dwell in the ontological assumptions in which that language of distinctions is
grounded, ontological assumptions which have become available as an unsaid
element of the dialogue, and which produce the ontological shift which is The
Forum‚Äôs goal.
