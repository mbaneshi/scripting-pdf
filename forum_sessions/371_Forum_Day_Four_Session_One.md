Forum Day Four: Session One

(laughter)
Don’t go around telling people life is empty and meaningless. Live your life from it. Don’t tell
people that. So what there is to get is that life is empty and meaningless and that that doesn’t
have any meaning. That is to say: the fact that life is empty and meaningless is empty and
meaningless. It’s just empty and meaningless.
JOYCE
I get that.
ERHARD
Okay, that’s all there is to get for the moment. I didn’t say you have to feel good.
Erhard continued working one by one with the people who had stood because they did not get that
life is empty and meaningless.
ERHARD  (to another participant)
What is your problem?
SALLY
I’m having a hard time with life being empty and meaningless that life is empty and
meaningless.
ERHARD
Let me make it easy for you. Life is empty and meaningless: Did you get that part?
SALLY
Yes.
ERHARD
What does that mean? What is the signifi cance of that statement?
SALLY
That it’s empty and meaningless, but I’m sitting here thinking, “Fuck it! Who cares?”
ERHARD
No, you just made it mean something. You didn’t get it because you made it mean something.
You said, “well if it’s empty and meaningless then...” See, once you said “then,” you didn’t get
it; you ruined it. Is that clear what I just said?
SALLY
Yeah, then it becomes something. Then it means something.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
What it means is, “Then fuck it!” So you’ve got to get, not only that it’s empty and meaningless,
but also that it’s empty and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless.
SALLY
Well, I want to do something with it...
ERHARD
I understand.
SALLY
But there’s nothing to do.
ERHARD
That’s right. There’s nothing to do. Anything you do ruins it. You want to make a prescription
out of it, Sally. You want it to tell you what to do. And like I said yesterday, the truth never
gives any prescription. And if you get any prescription out of the truth, you suck the truth value
out of it. It becomes devoid of any truth value. All you can do with this is get it. It’s not worth
anything; it’s worth nothing; it’s worthless: Because you can’t use it. It doesn’t help you to win;
it doesn’t help you to avoid losing; it doesn’t help you to be right... see, if only it would tell you
what to do with your life, then you would be happy. See, you would all be happy if we put on a
presentation here, skillfully enough so that you actually believed that you knew what you were
supposed to do with your life. So listen up. If we had a real scam ... and Wes and Kipp and I are
smart enough to put one together—make a note—it’s maybe worth doing.
(laughter)
But I want you to listen. What would people say if you did The Forum and it left you knowing
clearly what you were supposed to do with your life? People would really love that, wouldn’t
they?
SALLY
It would be a lot easier to sign up.
ERHARD
Yeah, it would be a lot easier to sign up, and we could charge more.
(laughter)
I want you to see how silly you are. If The Forum... You’d really have to believe it, wouldn’t
you? Otherwise it would be bullshit. Suppose after The Forum was all over, you had no doubt—
none—it was crystal clear to you that you had found out what you were supposed to do with
your life, really supposed to do. You would be very happy. Very happy. If you knew exactly
what you were supposed to do, what you’re really supposed to do, you’d be real happy, because
you’d have the answer. Julie?
Nothing: Beyond Nihilism
In An Introduction to Metaphysics, Heidegger points out that if
the fundamental question of metaphysics were to be put simply
as “Why are there beings?” then we would be starting from an
assumption of the being’s is-ness, its givenness as a being. But,
says Heidegger, with the addition of a second clause—“Why are
there beings at all instead of nothing?”—the givenness of the
being is thrown into question, and the being itself is held out “into
the possibility of not-being,” and thus begins “to waver” (IM 31).
Until we have confronted this possibility of non-Being, and have
thus opened ourselves to the other side of Being, we have not
appropriated our true nature: “Da-sein means: being held out into
the nothing” (“WM” in BW 103).
W
The event of nihilation is an essential element of Being:
“Being nihilates—as Being” (“LH” in BW 261). However, this
W
statement should not be heard as justifying charges that
Heidegger’s thinking is nihilism:
But where is the real nihilism at work? Where
one clings to current beings and believes it is
enough to take beings, as before, just as the
beings that they are. But with this, one rejects
the question of Being and treats Being as a
nothing (nihil), which in a certain way it even
“is,” insofar as it essentially unfolds. Merely to
chase aft er beings in the midst of the oblivion
of Being—that is nihilism. . . . In contrast, to
go expressly up to the limit of Nothing in the
question about Being, and to take Nothing into
the question of Being—this is the first and only
fruitful step toward the true overcoming of
nihilism. (IM 226
