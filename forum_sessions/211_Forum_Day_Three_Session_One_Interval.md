Forum Day Three: Session One Interval
197
For Heidegger . . . the deepest meaning of a text is ‘concealed’ within it, for what a
text has to say is ‘unspoken’ in it.” This is why Heidegger’s interpretations appear
“outrageous” and “scandalous,” says Caputo: Heidegger hears a “primal address,”
“the power of the first word” (The Mystical Element in Heidegger’s Thought 170).
It is also useful, given the emphasis that Heidegger’s later thinking placed on
the generative nature of the language of poetry, to consider this passage from his
analysis of the Anaximander fragment, considered “the oldest fragment of Western
thinking”: “Thinking of Being is the original way of poetizing. . . . Because it poetizes
as it thinks, the translation which wishes to let the oldest fragment of thinking itself
speak necessarily appears violent” (EGT 19).
Thus Heidegger may be seen in his exploration of Greek thinking to be weaving
a linguistic and poetic tapestry, threaded throughout with ambiguity, but a tapestry
to which his entire thought is devoted: the language of Being, which is already
always in language. If language is “the house of Being,” the question of Being is
necessarily implicit in every question and yet at the same time always beyond
language: “Being remains unthought” (“LH” in BW 242).
His etymological discursions should therefore be considered in the same way
as his phenomenological proposals regarding Dasein’s existential components: we
should try them on, to consider whether, in the end, they allow us to see something
we had not heretofore seen. As Polt points out, Heidegger’s etymologies, while
idiosyncratic, nevertheless succeed in shedding a new light on the tradition:
“Translating logos as ‘reason’ may not be wrong, but it certainly does less to make us
think than does Heidegger’s rendition of it as ‘collecting collectedness’” (Heidegger:
An Introduction 135).

SPEAKING BEING
The Forum resumed at 12:55 pm. Wes was on the platform, and called for participants to share about
having called their parents or others in their lives to “get complete.”
PRESTON
I think I’ve had what’s called a breakthrough. I will try to contextualize it using the language I
am learning here.
WES
Why don’t you just share it?
PRESTON
I always feel better after a disclaimer. I was in New Jersey two weeks ago and Werner was there.
On the blackboard was written: “I am prepared to be the man I haven’t been, and I won’t be the
man I was.” And what came to me as I was settling up with my parents is that I chose to honor
the integrity of the process.
WES
What’s happening in The Forum could be called coaching. That’s the conversation The Forum
leaders are committed to. Very few people in life are coachable. Children are uncoachable.
Because every time you say anything to them they say, “I know.” And very few of us ever grow
out of that. Making oneself coachable is an act of generosity.
PRESTON
It was an act of trust. I got that as soon as the fl oor is raised by one of us, it aff ects all of us.
There’s a redundancy of overlap that makes for perfect survival. I felt the mechanism of the
fl oor. My racket is manipulation: When it comes to relationships with women, fi rst I fascinate,
then I entice sexually, and then I become emotionally unavailable. But I’m able to be with
that now. The boss racket I run is manipulation. The way I am in the world is manipulation.
And the way that it is, is that you can have anything in the world as long as it isn’t touched by
manipulation. The manipulation that I’ve crafted into a high art turns out to be the only thing
that can sabotage what really exists, which is, you can have it, just don’t tell a story, have it, go
about the steps to have it. I completed with my parents, who are both gone. I see that I’ve got
doubts to meet every situation, but I’ve also begun listening. I want to acknowledge you all for
the privilege.
WES
So you want to hear in people’s speaking: The Forum. That’s the whole Forum. So now he’s
going into the bonus land. He got the whole Forum. You don’t even have to remember what he
said. What you want to see is The Forum working in people’s speaking, and allow yourself to be
used by it. Joyce?
JOYCE
Yesterday, I was clear that I was complete with my father, who had passed away. Then I
looked at my mother, and saw that she is perfect the way she is, and that I was complete with
