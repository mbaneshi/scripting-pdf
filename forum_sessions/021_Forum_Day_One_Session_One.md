Forum Day One: Session One
7
PRELUDE
More than 700 people were assembled in the ballroom of the Hyatt Regency Hotel in San
Francisco on the morning of December 27th, 1989. This was the first day of The Forum, and the
occasion was unique in several ways. The first was that this Forum was to be led by Werner
Erhard himself. Although he had created the technology of language that constituted The
Forum, since 1973, to accommodate growing demand for the program across the United States
and in Europe, the course had increasingly been led by members of a growing body of est
Trainers, and later Forum leaders, a group of men and women trained by Erhard. As of 1989
there were forty-three Forum leaders, ten women and thirty-three men.
A second unique aspect of this four-day event was that it was an exceptionally large Forum
composed of various groups in addition to the 502 regular participants (the usual number
ranged from 100 to 250). Forty Forum leaders were also present as part of their training; during
breaks in the procedure, they met with Erhard for debriefing sessions that the senior author
attended as part of a special program for Forum graduates called Openings, a group of approx-
imately 100 participants who were permitted to observe without actively participating. Also
in the room were a number of invited observers who occupied a visitors‚Äô gallery and whose
number varied during the course of The Forum. Last, a large contingent of staff and assistants
(volunteers) performed logistical duties throughout the four days.
Due to the efforts of the assistants, the ballroom set-up remained consistent across all
sessions of each of the four days. Regular participants and Forum leaders were seated in rows,
theater-style, before a raised platform which stretched across most of the width of the room,
and included a runway section extending well into the center of the audience area. Arranged
on the platform were three chalkboards, two bar-height director‚Äôs chairs, a music stand, and
a large table which held a water pitcher and glasses, tissues, and writing materials. Openings
participants and other observers were seated on risers at the rear of the room. Also at the rear
of the room was an enclosed translators‚Äô booth: among the participants in Openings were
twenty-five observers from Japan, seminar leaders and staff members in the Tokyo office of
Werner Erhard and Associates. They listened to the proceedings in simultaneous translation
through earphones connected to the translators‚Äô booth. Finally, three television cameras were
placed strategically around the room to record the event, and several television monitors were
placed so that most participants could watch the proceedings on video if they chose.
THE FORUM BEGINS
At 9:00 am, unannounced, Werner Erhard walked onto the platform. His manner was relaxed
and casual. He wore dark tan slacks, a white shirt open at the collar, and an olive sweater
vest. He greeted the participants in a friendly way, welcomed guests, and asked for questions
while late arrivals were completing their paperwork. He asked if there was anything about the
television cameras that needed clearing up, and he explained the presence of the Openings
participants and the observers seated in the Gallery. Someone asked about the people wearing
earphones, and he explained about the translators and participants from Japan. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good
question,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúQuestions like that . . . what about, what if?‚Äù
Participants who raised their hands were asked to stand and wait until they were given a
microphone; an assistant was stationed on each aisle to deliver one. After Erhard responded

SPEAKING BEING
Talking about Being
One of the similarities between the work of Werner Erhard and
Martin Heidegger is that both are designing a language for a
specific purpose: the evocation of Being. Since the debut of The
Forum in 1985, Erhard has regularly incorporated Heideggerian
terminology into his vocabulary, and has quoted Heidegger
extensively in his courses. It is the primary thesis of this book that
Erhard‚Äôs work is aligned in significant ways with the philosophy of
Martin Heidegger. Even the est Training, the beginnings of which
t
predate Erhard‚Äôs encounter with Heidegger (circa 1980), already
was aligned in significant ways with Heidegger‚Äôs thinking. This
alignment allowed Erhard to creatively incorporate Heideggerian
language in the delivery of what would become The Forum.
Heidegger‚Äôs language, on first encounter, is notoriously
difficult; he regularly invented new German terms for his ideas,
and translators have struggled to capture his meanings. Erhard
likewise uses words in unconventional ways, and calls his work
a ‚Äútechnology of language‚Äù in recognition of that fact. It is the
experience of the authors that a comparative inquiry into the two
bodies of work illuminates the thinking of both men, and helps
to clarify the linguistic complexity of Heidegger‚Äôs writing. In this
book, we intend gradually to unconceal (a Heideggerian term
l
Erhard has used) that clarity (IM 116).
This is not to say that either body of thought ever reaches the
kind of logical understandability that we generally expect in what
we read and hear. ‚ÄúIf you walk out of here understanding,‚Äù Erhard
tells The Forum participants at one point, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the booby prize.‚Äù
Both Heidegger and Erhard are attempting to communicate
something that, on that familiar level, cannot be communicated
or grasped. This is new territory for communication, and requires
both a new language (or, as Erhard says, new ‚Äúlanguaging‚Äù) and a
new way of listening.
We request, therefore, that the reader join us in embracing
the atmosphere of questionability that must surround this entire
to several questions about the various colors of name tags worn by people in the room, one
participant raised her hand. Erhard called upon her to stand, and she asked about Erhard‚Äôs use
of language.
ERHARD
You need a language that gives you access to the kind of detail that you need to be a brain sur-
geon... The language you and I are going to use in here is also a specifi c language. It‚Äôs designed
to let you get at something you can‚Äôt get at without that language. Surgeons generally confi ne
that kind of speaking to the operating room, and so do I. I don‚Äôt use that language when I‚Äôm out
to dinner. For the most part it‚Äôs unseemly to use special language when you‚Äôre with people who
don‚Äôt share in that language.
Erhard asked for more questions. After he called on someone, he explained the reasons for
standing up and for calling on multiple people (‚Äúto allow time to get microphones to them‚Äù). She
asked about logistics. Erhard said it would happen later. She sat down.
BLAKE (after receiving a microphone from an assistant)
I don‚Äôt know whether The Forum started yet, but I wanted to get through my apprehension of
speaking before the group.
ERHARD
I suggest that those of you who have a fear of speaking take the same opportunity as Blake did.
In The Forum no one is required to stand up and speak, though it is in your interest to do so,
especially if you are reluctant to stand and speak.
Erhard also discussed the schedule of the course, pointing out that the daily ending time would be
sometime between 11:00 pm and 1:00 am, adding that
ERHARD
Nobody guarantees you that schedule. You want to be clear about that. We‚Äôre going to do this
as long as it takes to get it done.
In addition, he said, The Forum would not be complete until the completion of the evening session,
which would be held on the following Thursday evening‚Äîsimultaneously in several cities, since
many participants in this Forum had traveled to San Francisco for this event. Participants were
encouraged to bring guests to their respective evening sessions.
As the conversation proceeded into the second hour, it gradually became clear, without transition,
that the serious business of the course had begun. A participant named Ruth rose to say that she
was pessimistic about getting the results of The Forum. Erhard began his response by acknowledg-
ing the validity of her doubt.
