Forum Day Four: Session One

(laughter)
ERHARD
Okay good. Raphaela?
RAPHAELA
That’s my story, when we went through the fear process: I found myself angry because all these
people were acting the way they were and then I saw that I was going through this process of I
couldn’t be whatever it was I was going to be because I was angry with these people for making
these really fucking weird noises. Distracting me: “Come on, shut up and let me be who I am,”
you know.
(laughing)
ERHARD
Why are they laughing? Do you know?
RAPHAELA
It’s really silly.
ERHARD
And also there’s a certain recognition. People laugh when they recognize themselves in other
people. Like when you said the king has no clothes, everybody laughed, right? Because they
saw it all along but nobody had said it.
RAPHAELA
So right now I’m working on trying to understand the not having meaning in my life, because for
so long it’s been “there has to be a meaning,” “there has to be a purpose,” you know, you do things
in-order-to. And it’s really hard for me to get off  that because, my story is that’s what my parents
have taught me. And the real truth is that they raised me, they fed me, and they loved me, but I
get...
KIPP
The truth is you’re a human being, and that’s what you get with being human. That’s what
you get when you get here and the party’s over. You get the kind of being that gives everything
meaning. And what you’re doing is thrashing around inside the trap. Flailing around. Well if it
doesn’t mean anything, what does that mean?
RAPHAELA
Well, I now say... I hear that it doesn’t mean anything, so how do I get out of that trap, which is
a trap in itself?
At 9:45, Wes entered and joined Kipp in this interaction.

SPEAKING BEING
WES  (to Raphaela)
Did you ever see Chinese handcuff s? You stick your fi ngers in them.
RAPHAELA
No.
WES
So imagine this gadget where you put your index fi ngers on either side of it, and then you go to
pull your fi ngers out. You know what happens?
(to the group)
What happens?
(many answer together: “it tightens up”)
See, that’s your problem! You never stuck your fi ngers in a Chinese handcuff !
(laughter)
So you’re going to have to make this up. You stick your fi ngers in this thing. You pull on it and
then it tightens. Can you get that?
RAPHAELA
Yeah.
WES
And then you pull on it more and it tightens. And the harder you pull to get your fi ngers out,
the tighter it gets. Can you get that? That’s what’s happening right now. You are in a giant Chi-
nese handcuff . How do you like it? It’s called your life.
RAPHAELA
I don’t like it.
WES
Good. That’s the fi rst recognition. If that makes any diff erence.
RAPHAELA
I don’t like to be wrong and for me being in a Chinese handcuff  is being able to be right.
WES
Yeah, it’s not a matter of being wrong. It’s just a matter of it doesn’t work. Not for someone who
wants to live their life. Either way you’re going to die, so it’s just a conversation right now. But
someday you’ll be dead and they’ll put on your tombstone: “lived her life fully,” or they’ll put
there something like “tried to get out of the trap, and died...”
