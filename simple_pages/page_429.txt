Forum Day Four: Session Two 
415
WES
You’ve gotta have something be wrong.
DONALD
It’s fun to be stuck in “I’m fat and my mother...” There’s more juice in the being stuck than in
just going ahead and losing weight. What’s that about?
WES
It’s called “racket.” That’s what it’s about.
DONALD
Okay, so I’ve got a racket.
WES
You are a racket. And your whole “fat” story is part of your racket. All your problems about
“fat” are part of your racket, and all your solutions to those problems are part of the racket. And 
all your not-solutions to those problems are part of the racket...
DONALD
If it’s a racket then there’s some payoff  holding it in place.
WES
Absolutely.
DONALD
I thought it happened the other way around. The costs... I got the costs... There’s some payoff  in
holding onto my little problem here. So I’ve got some payoff ...
WES
You want to be looking at what Donald is looking at: your problems and their relationships to
your racket, and your payoff s and your costs. That’s what the conversation—that’s what makes 
the diff erence in the conversation; that’s what you want to be looking at. There should be an
opening into the problems that compose your life. Now—”That harmonizes with the rest of The
Forum?”—that’s what you want to be looking at.
DONALD
So I’ve got a racket called—I have, I’ve manufactured, I’ve created a racket called “I’m fat and
I want to lose weight,” right? This is a racket. I can see the costs. The costs are real clear: it’s 
health, it’s aliveness, vitality.
WES
No your racket is, “I want to lose weight but I can’t.”
