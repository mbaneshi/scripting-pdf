SPEAKING BEING
DONALD
Right, okay. That’s it.
WES
“And my mother’s the one who did it to me.” Was it your mother?
DONALD
Yeah. As a matter of fact.
(laughter)r
WES
You love to make your mother wrong! You really do. He can do it on a daily basis. He can live
now... Here’s how he solved the problem of how to make his mother wrong on a continual basis.
He has a problem with his weight. So every time he looks in the mirror his mother’s wrong.
Think about how accessible that is to him now. He doesn’t even need to call her up on the 
phone. It’s just: Look in the mirror. That’s the payoff . Making her wrong is the payoff . You love
it. People love to make people wrong. There’s nothing like it: It’s the spice of life. 
DONALD
Wes, I saw some people in New York a couple of weeks ago and they said, “Donald, you’ve
gained a lot of weight since moving to California.” I said “well, the relationship I moved out 
here for didn’t work out.”
WES
Oh, so you made that relationship wrong.
DONALD
Got it.
WES (to the group)
Donald is learning something. His mother was the teacher—no, his need to make his mother
wrong is the teacher. He can make people wrong by gaining weight. It works every time. And 
they did it to him. And they’re creeps, just like his mother, the original weight giver.
(laughter)r
By the way, your problems are like that. They repeat themselves. They’re repetitive in nature. So
that’s an insight.
DONALD
My mother...
