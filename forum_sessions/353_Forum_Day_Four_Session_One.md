(referring to the video form)
and in that action there was magnanimity. There was being big. And it’s extraordinarily attrac-
tive. I mean extraordinarily attractive, and I don’t mean it looks good, Kevin.
KEVIN
No. The nice thing about it is that I don’t even need it now.
ERHARD
Exactly.
KEVIN
Now that I got it I don’t need it.
ERHARD
Now, let’s get that one last thing straight for everybody. That’s right. Nobody pays any attention
to your opinion. Nobody pays any attention to your expression of what you agree or disagree
with. Particularly young people don’t pay much attention to it. They’re organized not to pay any
attention to it. They need not to pay any attention to it. They’re struggling to establish them-
selves. And they cannot get away from the message delivered by who you are. That makes a
diff erence for them no matter what their stance in the matter is. Okay, please go on.
KEVIN
Well this person I saw as me twenty or thirty years ago. I don’t even know how many charac-
teristics of this person I want to describe... but there was a lot of defi ance in the statement that
was made.
ERHARD
Defi ance?
KEVIN
Defi ance, defying you. And when I fi rst came here I still had some of that defi ance. I’m sure
that...
(laughing)
I know why they’re laughing.
ERHARD
And the smile on your face is an expression of being able to be with their laughing, which is a
lot more powerful than being insulted by it or wondering why they are laughing.
KEVIN
So I think I probably had a pretty good need to take you on. And I probably wouldn’t have
taken you on because I understand how stupid it is to take you on, even if I wanted to take you

on, because I’m playing on your fi eld and you’re going to win. There’s no question about that,
even if I’m as good as you are. By last night I didn’t have the need to take you on anymore. I
didn’t care if I took you on. And I didn’t care if I won. And I didn’t care if I lost if I took you on.
It didn’t make any diff erence. So that was really good. So, back to the young person I am trying
to get to. I don’t know why: There’s some reason I’m trying to get to this person and I don’t
understand what that is. Somebody came up to me last night after I fi nished and said that must
have really been hard to do. Last night was not hard to do. Today is hard to do.
ERHARD
Stingy is easy. Magnanimous is not easy.
KEVIN
So, to this person, I came in here and I’m a person who has spent their whole life—I’m 56 years
old—I spent my whole life, I don’t think, ever trying to look into my head, until just recently,
and so I’m new at this game. I’m not a head looker. I’ve been busy being successful and all that
and so I’m looking at this young person. Not a real young person. Just getting a little beyond
young, but really defi ant, really pissed off  about something. I wanted to say to that person “Hey
look boy, I’m the biggest case of all,” which I’m sure a lot of you are saying “No, I am.” But I
know I am the biggest case of all, that came into here thinking  “Boy, I’m going to have to put
up with a lot of bullshit,” but I think there must be something to this thing, and I’m clever
enough that I can get around the bullshit, and sort that out, do it my way and control it, and fi g-
ure out whether there was really anything good in this and I’ll extract out what I think is good
in this and I’ll let the bullshit slide by my ear. And the reason that I think I’m able to get some-
thing out of this: I’m lucky I guess. I came into this, well, the only way I can get something out
of this is if I just really say “okay, push those thoughts out of your mind, and get something out
of this. I’m gonna get something out of this. I’m going to get into this.” And I’ve really gotten
into it, and last night was a hell of a night, because I went to bed and it was a long time before I
went to sleep, thinking. My head was exploding going through all these things, my assignment
and everything else, and boy, did I make progress. I’m not sure... Something happened, I’ve
had so many breakthroughs...
Let’s get clear. It’s not progress, it’s dropping stuff .
KEVIN
I’ve dropped a load they must have heard...
(laughter)
At least four or fi ve fl oors down.
ERHARD
That’s generous Kevin. That’s generous. That’s generosity. Sharing “winning” is generosity.
KEVIN (continuing)
