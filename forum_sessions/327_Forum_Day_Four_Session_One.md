Forum Day Four: Session One

ELYSE
I started to feel sick yesterday, and I wondered what was wrong with me that I was sick, and
I’m not supposed to be sick. I could hardly sit in the room last night. During the break last
night we went out for dinner, and I thought “I better go lay down for a while, otherwise I’m not
going to be able to make it, I’m not going to be able to pay attention to what’s happening, I’m
not going to be able to do it.” And I couldn’t see what I couldn’t be with, and fi nally it struck
me. What I couldn’t be with is—because I’d been thinking: “what’s my racket?” I thought that
my racket was that I couldn’t be with how much people loved me because I was afraid that
people didn’t love me, and I saw that that wasn’t my racket at all. My racket is that I’ve had no
capacity to be with how much I love people and express that. I’ve said it like a concept, and I
have to do things in order to express my love for people rather than “be” my love for people.
And I still feel sick, and I have an incredible life and I can hardly be with that.
KIPP
Well, it makes you wrong.
MARGARET
Yes, absolutely. It’s amazing. I wake up every morning and I think, “this isn’t my life, this is
someone else’s life. Somebody’s going to fi nd out about me and they’re going to pull the rug,
and it’s not going to be there anymore, and it’s all going to be fucked.”
KIPP
Well, it already is.
(laughter)
See, if you recall the conversation we started having last night, the clearing that it is to be a
human being that you live in: “there’s something wrong.”
MARGARET
There is. Absolutely.
KIPP
Yeah. And it’s not conceptual. You are “there’s something wrong.” You’ve also made that mean
something. Not only is something wrong, it means something that there’s something wrong.
MARGARET
It shouldn’t be that way.
KIPP
What else?
The ‘scandal of philosophy’ is not that this
proof has yet to be given, but that such proofs
are expected and attempted again and again.
[. . .] If Dasein is understood correctly, it defies
such proofs, because, in its Being, it already
is what subsequent proofs deem necessary to
demonstrate for it. (BT 249
T
)
“
That is, one always knows the world from the position of already
being out there in it.
When Dasein directs itself toward something
and grasps it, it does not somehow first get
out of an inner sphere in which it has been
proximally encapsulated, but its primary
kind of Being is such that it is always ‘outside’
alongside entities which it encounters and
s
which belong to a world already discovered.
(BT 89, emphasis added
T
)
“
On the other hand, there is certainly a sense in which we are
inside:
[E]ven in this ‘being-outside’ alongside
the object, Dasein is still ‘inside,’ if we
understand this in the correct sense; that is
to say, it is itself ‘inside’ as a Being-in-the-
world which knows. And furthermore, the
perceiving of what is known is not a process
of returning with one’s booty to the ‘cabinet’
of consciousness aft er one has gone out and
grasped it; even in perceiving, retaining, and
preserving, the Dasein which knows remains
outside, and does so as Dasein. (BT 89
T
)
“
So the inside/outside dilemma is a false problem. Human beings
know their world through existing in it and coping with it.

SPEAKING BEING
MARGARET
Well I can see that it doesn’t mean anything and then I woke up this morning and I thought,
well then I shouldn’t be upset that I didn’t feel good, or that my throat hurts, or that my head
hurts.
KIPP
This is very good now. This is the giving meaning to no meaning. See “If it doesn’t mean any-
thing, therefore, in order to...”
MARGARET
Or if I really got it, I wouldn’t be sick.
KIPP
Right.
MARGARET
I don’t even know if I’m sick. Truth is, I don’t even know.
KIPP
Right. Well, for sure you’d be some other way than you are.
MARGARET
I’m kind of like backed into a corner. I can’t talk about it, so now I should feel a diff erent way
than I feel physically. Which is crazy.
KIPP
No it’s not crazy, it’s called normal. This is normal.
MARGARET
I got it.
KIPP
This is what everybody walks around in every day.
MARGARET
And I also see: I’ve designed my entire life to be protected from anyone fi nding out that that’s so
about me. I’ll produce great, unbelievable results; I’ll create great things around me so that people
won’t fi nd out. It’s so fucking elaborate! People won’t fi nd out about me that all I’m petrifi ed of is
that people don’t love me.
KIPP
You know, I think that we think it’s elaborate. We walk around every day with these signs on
telling everybody exactly the way it is with us.
Circumspection
Heidegger also points out that this antecedent understanding
of the world has a particular quality. The things with which we
concern ourselves in our everyday world are the things that we
use in the business of living. Encountered this way, they are the
material of a phenomenological knowing—a knowing that grows
l
out of Being (BT 95). This knowing may or may not be explicit in
T
our awareness:
How do the beings with which we dwell show
themselves to us primarily and for the most
part? Sitting here in the auditorium we do
not in fact apprehend walls—not unless we
are getting bored. Nevertheless, the walls
are already present before we think them as
objects. (BPP 163
P
)
“
Before they are objects for us, the walls are present as a part of
the equipmental context. In a knowing that arises from Being, I am
not immediately present to the things in my world in the role of
contemplator, one who seeks to understand and describe them.
Rather I encounter and use them in the business of living:
The nearest things that surround us we call
equipment. There is always already a manifold
of equipment: equipment for working, for
traveling, for measuring, and in general things
with which we have to do. (BPP 163
P
)
