SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
That’s what you get for thinking.
SUSAN
Well I called my husband last night, and he’s the one I thought had forced me to do it. 
KIPP 
Let’s get a little more rigorous. You had the thought...
SUSAN
Right. We were recently married in October. He participated in The Forum a couple of months 
ago. When he came back from it he was so excited and he was great. He was excited about 
our relationship—which was wonderful. But what really bothered me was that he said it was 
because of The Forum. And that bugged me. My husband told me the reason he married me 
was because of The Forum. That is a bunch of garbage; “You married me because you love me, 
and there’s nobody who is making you marry me.” I went to Forum Introductory meetings and 
didn’t like it because they wanted to work on me. 
KIPP
No, you didn’t like it because you’re a creep. 
SUSAN
Right. Yesterday I was sitting in here, and all these people have these major problems. I don’t 
see a major problem in my life. And then I said, “my gosh, that’s one right there.”
KIPP (to the group)
That’s big. Some of you haven’t gotten here yet. Slow group.
SUSAN
As I developed it in my mind, I realized I got to share this, and so I put my hand up. “Now what 
if he calls on me? I have to make sure I got this all planned out to say it right.” Then I realized: 
I’m terrifi ed.  
KIPP
That’s the point. The rest was fi ll. Keep going, please.
SUSAN
The thing that I came into The Forum to accomplish was to have the ability to fi nd the right 
position. I just moved up here, and I don’t have a job yet. I wanted to wait until after the 
holidays...
KIPP
Wait. What’s true is you don’t have a job yet.
