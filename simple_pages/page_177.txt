Forum Day Two: Session Three 
163
ERHARD
Okay that’s what happened and that’s what you’re sad about. You had a bond with your father,
and just her presence broke that bond. What did you decide?
JANE
That I had to break the bond between them, her and me? Tell her how I feel. And tell her how I 
felt that she came.
ERHARD
That’s not a strange way for a little girl to feel, now is it? 
JANE
No.
ERHARD
But for a mature woman, that’s clearly not what happened, is it?
JANE
I don’t understand.
ERHARD
Looking from your point of view now, did your father’s marriage break the bond between you
and your dad?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
Can you get off  it with your stepmom about breaking the bond between you and your dad?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
So maybe you could say to your stepmom that when I was a little girl, I didn’t even realize it un-
til I saw it today, but there’s been something in the relationship between you and I. “When I was
a little girl and you came into my life, it felt like you had broken my bond with my father, but 
now I see that that isn’t true. So that’s not between you and me any more. I can be fully related
to you.” How does that feel?
JANE
But I’m still sad. I don’t know what it’s about.
