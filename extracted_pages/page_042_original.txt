SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (pausing)
You’ve got a story called pressure. You’ve got a story and then there’s what happened.
BILL
I just want to say that I was disillusioned by the salesmanship involved in getting me into the
program...
ERHARD (interrupting)
What is this salesmanship?
BILL
Let me fi nish my sentence!
ERHARD
I’m not interested in your fi nishing your sentence when it’s bullshit.
BILL
Bullshit fl ows both ways.
(laughter)
ERHARD
What is this salesmanship you’re talking about? You wouldn’t have been called any more if 
you’d said no. You said “Call me some more.”
(turning to the group)
If you think you were pressured, I want you to stop lying about it and tell the truth about what 
happened or get out of here. 
BILL 
Why don’t you look at me? These people aren’t interested in being entertained by you on my 
eccentricities.
ERHARD
Bill, I’m more likely to know what they’re interested in than you. Are you able to make a choice 
about being here now that you’ve got a choice? 
BILL (stammering) 
Some of what you’ve done is off ensive to me. I might get something. I don’t know.
ERHARD
Would you make that choice for me?
