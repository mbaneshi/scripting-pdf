Forum Day Three: Session Three 219
ERHARD
You’re a human being. There’s always going to be something up for you. Your life is always 
going to be a soap opera. And it’s always going to be a joke. And every once and a while you’ll 
come back to me and get it again.
TONY
I just want to know one thing.
ERHARD
If we get this one thing it’s going to change everything, right? It’s not going to be the way it is, 
it’ll be some other way if you get this. If you get this one thing answered, just this one thing.
TONY
Where does God fi t into all this? 
ERHARD
Remember I said I didn’t discuss God with people who don’t know their ass from a hole in the 
ground.
TONY
Yeah, believe me, there’s a hole in the ground right over there. This is really big for me.
ERHARD
What?
TONY
Having God in my life, and that God makes a diff erence in other people’s lives.
ERHARD
That’s fi ne. Yeah, but you want to make that diff erent than a fart.
TONY
Sure I do.
ERHARD
No, that’s disgusting. If you got God in your life, you’ve got God in your life. That’s all.
TONY
But if you have God in your life then you have purpose in your life.
ERHARD
Really? It’s not going to end with you being put in the ground and dirt being thrown in your 
face?
While these passages are from Heidegger’s early work, and the 
distinction appropriation became central in his later thinking, we 
propose that the unspoken Same can be heard in both cases. This 
intensely reflexive movement of thinking, called forth repeatedly 
throughout the four days of The Forum and culminating in Session 
Two of Day Four, is central to the achievement of its transformational 
outcome. It is also deeply embedded in Heidegger’s distinction 
appropriation, a term which suggests the taking-ownership of 
something that is already at some level one’s own. ■
