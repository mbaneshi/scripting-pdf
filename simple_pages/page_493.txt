Forum Day Four: Session Three 479
ERHARD
Now, you think that the ball is uncatchable or isn’t uncatchable. I’m telling you that his 
actions are not correlated to an “is uncatchable.” His actions are correlated with an “occurs as 
uncatchable.” Occurs. You get the diff erence?
JERRY
I get the second, what was the fi rst...?
ERHARD (throwing the ball to a participant in another part of the room from Jerry)
Let me ask you something: Was that ball uncatchable for you?
JERRY
Yes.
ERHARD
No, because there’s a possibility of your catching the ball.

you wouldn’t have put your hand up like that, you would have acted “clumsy.” So your actions, 
and her actions, and my actions, and his actions are all a correlate of the ball as an occurring, 
not the ball as an is. That ball is going a certain rate of speed and it is within a certain number 
of inches from your body.

around you—people, trees, dogs, the sky—do not merely exist, but 
are at every moment coming into existence. Imagine that when you 
look at a tree, you aren’t observing a thing that is just there, but 
an event. The tree is occurring. Instead of just a tree, like a thing, 
you are in the presence of a happening: treeing. The happening is 
ongoing, as the tree withdraws from the world and emerges—its 
emergence and withdrawal so correlated in time that they are 
perceived only as a quality of aliveness. You sense the withdrawal,
