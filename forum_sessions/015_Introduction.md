Introduction
In 1971, the television debut of All in the Family tickled an American public who
y
was also celebrating the successful moon landing, and safe return home, of two
Apollo space missions. In the same year, much smaller audiences took note of Igor
Stravinsky‚Äôs death and the birth of Calvin Broadus Jr. (aka Snoop Dogg/Lion); a
marketing phenomenon was born in Seattle with the opening of the first Star-
bucks; Idi Amin ousted Milton Obote to become the dictator of Uganda; and in the
new academic field of composition and rhetoric, a movement to elevate the status
of process began to stir. Meanwhile, in October of that year in a meeting room of
San Francisco‚Äôs less-than-swank Jack Tar Hotel, Werner Erhard assembled some
two hundred participants for the debut of the est Training. Given this timing for
the emergence of the est Training, media at the time characterized it as a part of
t
the human potential movement, but scholar Jonathan Moreno has more recently
called est ‚Äúthe most important cultural event after the human potential movement
itself seemed exhausted‚Äù (Impromptu Man 247).
Infamous for its rigorous ground rules and confrontational methods‚Äî
elements Erhard says were necessary in the liberated, let-it-all-hang-out, ‚Äúnew
age‚Äù ethos of the time‚Äîthe est Training (Latin for
t
it is, and an acronym for Erhard
Seminars Training) grew in popularity throughout the 1970s because of the im-
pressive benefits participants reported having received, including better relation-
ships and a greater sense of ‚Äúaliveness.‚Äù Trainees experienced being ‚Äúat cause‚Äù
in the matter of their lives, and having a new sense that their lives could make a
difference in the world. They felt ‚Äúfree to be.‚Äù This new sense of responsibility and
freedom allowed for breakthroughs in communicating with others, and enabled
them to produce results, both personal and professional, that they would previ-
ously have seen as unlikely.
At the source of this educational enterprise was an experience Erhard had
undergone earlier that year, although he later said it was ‚Äúnot in itself so much an
experience, as a shift in the context in which he held all process, including experi-
ence‚Äù (Bartley 168). In some traditions, such an event might be referred to as an
individual‚Äôs having undergone enlightenment; Erhard has called it a transformation.
He was, at this point in his life, a highly successful sales manager and trainer for a
large publishing company. Further, he had devoted much of the previous decade to
the rigorous exploration of various systems of enlightenment and personal devel-
opment, from Zen (the essential one, he says) to the Dale Carnegie course and Mind
Dynamics. But one morning in 1971, as he was driving across the Golden Gate Bridge
en route to his office, he suddenly realized that he knew nothing. As he related the
incident to his biographer, William Bartley:
All the things I had ever heard, and read, and all those hours
of practice, suddenly fell into place. It was so stupidly,
blindingly simple that I could not believe it. I saw that there
were no hidden meanings, that everything was just the
way that it is, and that I was already all right. . . . I realized
that I was not my emotions or thoughts. I was not my
ideas, my intellect, my perceptions, my beliefs. . . . I was
simply the space, the creator, the source of all that stuff. I
experienced Self as Self in a direct, unmediated way. I didn‚Äôt
just experience Self; I became Self. Suddenly I held all the
information, the content, in my life in a new way, from a new
mode, a new context. . . .  I am I am. (Bartley 167‚Äì168)
In other words, an experience of being. The insight Erhard derived from that ex-
perience subsequently became what thousands of est trainees would spend two
t
weekends and several hundred dollars to ‚Äúget‚Äù for themselves.
Discussing his work later, Erhard addressed the challenge he had confronted in
attempting to communicate what seemed essentially incommunicable: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt
do this in the ordinary sense of communication: I can‚Äôt have it and give it to you. But
I can communicate in a way so that you get an opportunity to realize that you have
it yourself already. Essentially, this is what the est Training was developed to do. It
t
provides a setting in which this kind of sharing takes place‚Äù (Bartley 169).
From the outset, the language of est was central to both its pedagogical process
and its public image. A fundamental tenet of the est Training, as well as its succes-
t
sor program, The Forum, has been that transformation lives in language, and that
participants keep the program‚Äôs results available in their lives by communicating
those results with others. At the same time, Erhard‚Äôs enterprise has consistently
eschewed traditional advertising. The only way people have become aware of his
work has been through hearing about it from their friends, family, or associates.
The resulting symbiotic relationship‚Äîthe program survives only when participants
communicate about it with family and friends, and it is through communicating
about it that participants keep the benefits alive in their experience‚Äîhas served the
work well through four decades. By 1985, when the est Training was discontinued
t
and replaced by The Forum, word-of-mouth had brought a half-million people to see
for themselves what this transformation was all about. As of 2019, another 2 million

people have graduated from The Forum, either the four-day Forum of Erhard‚Äôs time
through 1991, or the current iteration of the course, the three-day Landmark
Forum¬†(www.landmarkworldwide.com).1
Erhard‚Äôs influence on the culture has made itself felt in another way as well.
During the 1970s, when it sometimes seemed that every fifth person in San Francis-
co was an est graduate, you could generally detect that element of the population
t
by their use of the program‚Äôs language, which in casual use began to be heard as
jargon. Erhard‚Äôs use of this terminology, however, was highly purposive, and many
of those words and phrases made their way into the public sphere, some to last-
ing effect. An example has been the shift in the popular understanding of the term
sharing. Before est, people shared a cookie or a bench in the park; what was shared
was divided, and in the process one‚Äôs own share was inevitably diminished. But
in the est Training,
g participants shared their experience, and through sharing, that
experience was augmented. To share, in the world of est, was to communicate in
such a way that one‚Äôs self and not merely one‚Äôs story was made available, leaving the
f
other touched rather than merely informed. This meaning of the word, we assert, is
now common in our culture. Likewise, the term coaching, borrowed by Erhard from
the sports arena in the early eighties to identify the style of his pedagogy, has since
become ubiquitous in the field of management, human resources, and executive
coaching. And the ubiquitous Mastercard catchphrase, ‚ÄúMaster the possibilities,‚Äù
was born in the mind of an est graduate for whom the term
t
possibility had acquired
a new level of meaning; however, through overuse in the media, this new level of
meaning has diminished.
The move to discontinue the Training in 1985 and replace it with The Forum
arose from Erhard‚Äôs perception of a shift in the culture‚Äôs way of responding to the
Training; he wanted to design a course that was responsive to that shift. At this
point, while Erhard‚Äôs success during those years had been greeted by considerable
media curiosity, scholarly interest was moderate. Several studies of the est Training
t
attempted to measure its effects using a psychological model; while he considered
such efforts valuable, Erhard has asserted that this approach is inappropriate for
analysis of his work. His work, he says, is not psychological but ontological: his
concern is the being of human beings (‚ÄúHeart of the Matter‚Äù 1984). He has also
consistently emphasized that the focus of his work is the development of the lan-
guage in which it is articulated. Yet no significant scholarly work dealing either with
Erhard‚Äôs language use, or with the nature of an ontological methodology, has been
published, even in the academic fields most likely to be deeply concerned with
such matters‚Äîrhetoric and writing studies, business management, philosophy, and
communication studies. This book aims to begin to correct that omission.
Before proceeding, we offer this statement of authorial stance: The authors
have engaged extensively, both as participants and as scholars, in numerous pro-
grams designed by Werner Erhard. The senior author took the est Training for the
t
first time in 1973, and we have each participated a number of times in The Forum,
both during Erhard‚Äôs tenure in the organization and following his departure. Our
doctoral dissertations (University of Southern California, 1990; University of Arizona,
2008) consisted of rhetorical and philosophical analyses of The Forum. Based upon
this considerable study and experience, our assessment of Erhard‚Äôs work is un-
equivocal: we have found this work to be pedagogically effective and intellectually
significant in all of its historical iterations. Our intention in this book is to stimulate
its serious consideration by the academic community, as well as by others in the
culture at large.
It is also important to note that our approach as participant observers has
its limits. To carry out the design of the book, we have precluded a number of
approaches that readers may wish to see addressed, and we beg those readers to
indulge us. Before any significant and critical treatments could be viable, or even
possible, from a number of disciplines‚Äîincluding philosophy, communication stud-
ies, rhetorical criticism, and so on‚Äîthe phenomenon must be first made available.
We present this book as a way into the phenomenon in question, and consequently,
we invite members from a range of academic disciplines to enter the conversation
we are seeking to initiate.
Evolution
This is an historical document. It presents an account of one moment‚Äîalbeit a sig-
nificant one‚Äîin an ongoing project for the development of human being. The first
iteration of this project, the est Training, was designed to communicate to people
t
living in the cultural environment of the 1970s. As Erhard saw it, considerable logis-
tical rigor was required for the course to achieve its purpose, and thus the format
included demands for which est soon became notorious, including lengthy sessions
t
1 Landmark describes The Landmark Forum as a personal and professional development program,
based on the discipline of applied ontology and phenomenology. Erhard created the work in the
early 1970s and continued its development until in 1991 Landmark took over its ongoing devel-
opment as expressed in The Landmark Forum and other Landmark programs. As of the writing of
this book, the material and structure of The Forum have continued to be developed during three
decades since the 1989 Forum presented in this book. The Landmark Forum of today (circa 2019)
is less time (three days and an evening and each day ends by 10:00 pm), it incorporates the use of
PowerPoint displays and videos that enhance the participants‚Äô experience of and access to what is
being presented, and there is no use of profanity on the part of the program leaders.
