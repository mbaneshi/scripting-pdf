Forum Day Four: Session Two
393
So, here are problems. Whatever problem you got occurs here, in languaging. What is the name
of the box that problems come in?
PARTICIPANT
Declaration.
WES
No. Ultimately, yes, okay? But you’re a little too advanced for us. I want to know the specifi c
kind of declaration that problems occur in.
(referring to participants with yellow name tags, who are there taking The Forum for the fi rst time)
I want some yellows to answer this. I don’t want anybody “remembering” this.
A participant named Paul stood, the participant who, like Jake, had his “foot nailed to the fl oor”
concerning inauthenticity in a dialogue with Erhard in Session Two of Day One.
PAUL
You talked about being a problem. We talked about it being an obstacle before. What fi rst occurs
to me as the name of the box that problems come in is the problem box.
WES
No. Well, yes, but not useful.
PAUL
But what is the problem is really what the problem is and the problem is trying to label it. I
would think that it’s an obstacle and all the other things people would say it is.
WES
It’s not a box that shows itself to you. You remember we did that discussion? You remember that
“danger interaction”? The thing we did yesterday?
PAUL
How could I forget?
WES
Remember, we had a lot of stuff  go on the board. Then I proposed the possibility that there was
a frame around all of it, that all of it was variations of, like a meme, of “Life is dangerous for
human beings.” We’re looking for some statement like that. What is the statement that...
PAUL
You are the problem. You become the problem. Within that framework that’s...

SPEAKING BEING
WES
Yeah. Okay. That’s not how problems occur. Problems don’t occur for people “I am the problem.”
PAUL
Okay.
WES
When my car is broken, the car is the problem. And there’s a way my conversation occurs, my
relationship to all of that.
PAUL
Okay.
WES
You can just keep looking. You got it started well, though.
PAUL
Um, so you’re saying that the box in which problem occurs has a name to it...
WES
A statement in which it occurs has a particular name to it. The conversation occurs in “hu-
man being.” It’s the already always conversation. You know, you’re born into languaging, and
languaging gives you your life, reality, and problems: Once a problem comes your way, there’s
an already always way it occurs for you. That’s the box: the already always way it occurs for you.
You have nothing to do with it. You didn’t choose it...
PAUL
It’s the rainstorm.
WES
It’s the rainstorm. We want to get a sense of the already always way it occurs for you. This is one
of those “too simple for complicated minds...”
PAUL (laughs)
Okay, then maybe the problem is your racket.
WES
No, that’s an explanation of it maybe. We’re looking for the statement.
PAUL
The statement that contains the problem...
