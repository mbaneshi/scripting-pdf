Forum Day Four: Session One

ERHARD
And if you don’t get called on, you don’t get called on.
KEVIN
You’re right.
ERHARD
And that’s the way that it is. And you could make a great big drama out of that. “Wes doesn’t
like me. Kipp doesn’t like me even more. Nobody likes me. They’re trying to torture me. I really
got something to say that’s important. I gotta get up here, nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
nah nah.” Very good Kevin. Go on.
KEVIN
I was like that. Is it okay if I say something to somebody else in the group?
ERHARD
Not usually. But in your case we’ll make an exception. Go ahead.
(laughter)
I appreciate your asking.
KEVIN
Well I’d like to talk to someone in the group but I’m not quite sure how to handle it, but I’ll
count on you to stop me if I get out of line. I heard myself, as I told you before, I had every-
body’s racket so maybe I’m a good person to talk to everybody because I’ve got everybody’s
racket. But maybe everybody here has everybody’s racket... But there was a young person last
night that really got to me because I saw myself in that young person, maybe twenty, thirty
years ago, and I really wish I could talk to that young person but I don’t think I’ll be able to talk
to that young person because I got a feeling that that young person probably isn’t listening to
me right now.
WES
Actually I think they are. I think everybody is. I don’t believe what you... I don’t accept what
you’re saying. So let me tell you what you are saying: The future needs to be just like the past;
nobody can learn from anything. Everybody has to go through the same mistakes. It’s bullshit.
Something’s happening in the room in the conversation where the person twenty years young-
er than you, Kevin, is getting you. And the benefi t of the twenty years you screwed your life up.
KEVIN
I’m sorry, but I think that’s completely wrong, because I think that person’s sitting there
thinking “I can’t possibly learn anything from this old fart,” and...

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
They do say that but it doesn’t make any diff erence anyhow.
(applause)
And let me tell you what they learn from you, Kevin. Young people don’t learn from our
preaching. They learn from who we are. You know, you can’t miss your magnanimity. You
cannot miss it; it can’t be missed.
KEVIN
My magnanimity?
ERHARD
Yes, your magnanimity.
KEVIN
I’ll have to work on that a little later. If I can get that together with my stinginess, that’s gonna
take a lot of work.
ERHARD
Remember one thing. Stinginess is not a quality inside you. It’s a product of your actions. And
magnanimity is the same thing. You give yourself being big when you get off  it. When you’re
being moved in here by other people’s sharing, you can’t help it. I suppose you might be able
to do it, but it would be very diffi  cult to be in here and not be moved by people. And what
moves us is not their story. That may entertain us but it isn’t what moves us. What moves us
is their magnanimity. Magnanimity arises in action, like the act of getting off  it. That’s real
magnanimity. We don’t have a good way of talking about it because I have to say “you have to
be big,” and it sounds like some quality inside. There are no qualities inside people. Qualities
arise in action. And yes, yesterday you were being stingy, and you’re a bit thrown to being
stingy, and what you said last night gave you a possibility beyond being stingy. You know, you
bit the bullet. You spoke straight. And anytime somebody bites the bullet and talks straight
a possibility beyond their inauthenticity arises. And you gave yourself a new possibility last
night. You want to listen up because I’m putting this in words that you might fi nd a bit hard
to, you know, a bit hard to deal with.
KEVIN
I’m dealing with them.
ERHARD
Okay very good. So, last night in speaking straight and speaking yourself and being authentic
about your inauthenticity, you created a possibility beyond your inauthenticity, and today you
acted in that possibility...
And what moves us is not their story. That may
entertain us but it isn’t what moves us. What
moves us is their magnanimity. Magnanimity
arises in action, like the act of getting off  it.
