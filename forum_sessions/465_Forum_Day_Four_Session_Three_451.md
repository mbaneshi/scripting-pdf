Forum Day Four: Session Three 451
MAC
That is what we plan to do. And other issues have come up. For example, I told my wife, “You
know, we have a lot of tension around getting lost here in the Bay Area.” And we’ve gotten lost
a lot! You know, getting lost is like a way of life for us! So who I’m going to be the next time we
get lost, is lost. I’m going to let myself be lost and enjoy some new lost area!
(applause)
It’s genuine. It’s how I’m going to live! I’m amazed at the diff erence this is in my life! And how
did I get here? I’ve resisted this for something like ten years. I belong to a men’s group. Six of us.
Very intimate. Met twice a month. Five were involved with your program. I was not. I fought it.
I didn’t need it and I thought it was a bunch of shit. Okay? About six months ago my son called
me. He said “Dad, you know what? I just experienced something. I was at a Forum and I think
you ought to go.” I paused and listened to him. I was still resisting. And then he went and did
other programs and kept saying simply, “Dad, I think you ought to go.” And now I am going to
call him to thank him for the wonderful gift he has given me.
(long applause with many people standing)

Thank you very much. What occurred to me when you were standing, acknowledging Mac,
you know, what brings tears to your eyes is being in the presence of your own magnifi cence.
As Mac spoke, what he opened up for you is being in the presence of your magnifi cence. He
was astounding as he is in his speaking and his generosity, but what’s present in the room is
who you are. And by the way, if you’re not that way right now—some of you are at the other
level of the roller coaster and you think you should be where the other people are standing and
cheering for Mac—don’t get sucked into that. Wherever you are is where you are.
WES
The other thing you want to get is how shitty you were before The Forum.
(laughter)
It might be useful for you to confront what you were like for those people who shared The Forum
with you, and who you were like for others in your life. Regardless of whether they shared with
you skillfully or not, they were committed to something. And that’s a lot more than most people
are up to. And you couldn’t help but be in the presence of the work when Mac shared. This is a big
person, and you remember he and I had that conversation about the ending time the other day.
Same person. And this is who Mac is now. I had to confront the same thing when I did The Forum.
I’m inviting you to confront it: who you have been for other people and who you can be. And as
you step out of The Forum into your life... you know, I know that Mac will share The Forum with
people, and he’ll do it as well as he does, and he’ll learn and he’ll do it better—sounds pretty good
right now—and no matter how great Mac will be, there will be people unwilling to get what he’s
really committed to, who will turn it into something. And the question will be whether Mac will
stop being committed to whatever he’s committed to in sharing The Forum, or will he continue on
in the face of that.

SPEAKING BEING
Kipp asked participants to raise hands to indicate how many guests (who had invited the current
participants to take The Forum) were coming at 9 pm, so that enough chairs could be set up to
accommodate them.
MAUREEN
When you said, “Chocolate: choose!” I started to cry, because I have this big trauma drama that
has taken me forever to get over, that if I told it to you, I could make you cry, and I could write a
whole soap opera about my childhood, I mean it is so good, right? And it always felt like I never
had a choice, and I worked through that stuff , and I could never like really be with it, and it was
like when you said “chocolate: choose!” I had that choice to choose it, and I didn’t, I resisted it, I
made people wrong, and ran my rackets on them, did a lot of crazy stuff , and I just sat back there
and cried because I got that you said that for me. You gave me a gift. Thank you for giving me that.
KIPP
You’re welcome. Good work!
(applause)
The gift, the satisfaction, is in the creating of the distinctions. There was something inherently
satisfying in the creating of the distinction, which gave her freedom. Like The Karate Kid,
washing cars, waxing cars: wax on, wax off . Wax on, wax off  didn’t seem like freedom to the
karate kid until he got out on the court and played, and he was left in the presence of karate.
Coaching doesn’t look like what you think it should.
JORIE
I just came back from dinner and I was talking to my brother—he is also in The Forum—and
I have been struggling with The Forum. I was grieving over the relationship with my parents,
because I realized I didn’t really know them, with their stories and my stories. And my brother
helped me. He said, at the same time I was grieving, instead of having to grieve, those times I
was, I could have accepted the possibility that now I can be friends with them and just accept
them, and fi nd out who they are instead of grieving about who they were, and being sad about
all the stories that they have. And also, this is my fi rst time to share. This is just the beginning,
like everybody said, and I cannot tell you how much freedom it has given me. Talking about
choice and decision, in every part of my life, and especially my job. I just wanted to share that.
KIPP
Sharing it empowers you. The more you share it and make it real for yourself, the more it’s you.
Fabulous. Thank you very much.
(applause)

People who know me: I’m a very signifi cant guy. Very serious. I saw a racket of mine and how
it ties in during the choice exercise I wanted to share with everybody. What I do with people is
I make them authority fi gures. I don’t care who they are. Started off  with my fi rst wife. I made
her the boss: She was a couple years older than me. That was easy. Then I made my second wife
