Forum Day Four: Session Three 497
(applause)
ERHARD (to another participant)
You got it before. And now some gas has been introduced and now you don’t get it, is that it?
(laughter)
MELINDA
I’ll keep it short, okay? I have a friend, his son is brain-damaged. His brain works fi ne except 
for the part that controls his muscles. He can’t walk. If somebody throws him the ball, it’s 
uncatchable. 
ERHARD
Sure. If I cut your arms off  and throw you the ball, it’s uncatchable.
(laughter)
Don’t bring up this stupidity: It’s going to make you look silly. I’m not talking about some kind 
of magic that if you were a rock and the ball occurred as catchable that you would reach up and 
catch the ball.
MELINDA
I’m trying to see where this occurrence is.
ERHARD
It’s not in your muscles. Stick around. You’re asking the next question. Look, do you think with your 
brain? You know that if we opened up your head and stuck a pencil in your brain you wouldn’t feel it? 
MELINDA
I’ll accept that.
ERHARD
That’s the case. You don’t see with your brain. You see through your brain, maybe. It mediates 
seeing. You don’t see with your eyes either. You know those things you didn’t see and now you 
see? The eyes are a tube through which seeing comes, but not with what you see. And that’s the 
case with the guy with brain damage.
MELINDA
You said it’s an ontological event, but how could an ontological event occur...
ERHARD
Because the ontological event expresses itself through a physical tube. That’s trivial.
MELINDA
That’s what I don’t get: That an ontological event could occur by cutting off  someone’s arms.
