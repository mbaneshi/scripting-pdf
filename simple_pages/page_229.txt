Forum Day Three: Session Three 215
Erhard sat on the edge of the platform as he interacted with Tony, watching him intently. 
TONY
Empowering others is what I want to do in life. 
ERHARD
And when you do it, you do it, and when you don’t, you don’t. And that’s the whole story.
TONY
I just want to keep doing it.
ERHARD (raising his voice and standing up to approach Tony)
You will if you do and you won’t if you don’t. And if you make it the Holy Grail you’ll make it 
into a fucking joke.
TONY (laughing)
Okay...
ERHARD
You get it?
TONY
Okay, so I won’t make it the Holy Grail.
ERHARD (sitting down again)
Yes you will. See, you just turned not making it into another making it. “I won’t make it! That’s 
the way I’ll make it, by not making it. That’s my new making it, that’s what’s going to get me 
over the wall.”
TONY
I’m not ever thinking about the wall, I just want to do...
ERHARD
So what? You want, so what? 
 
TONY
Okay.
ERHARD
The stars don’t move for “you want.”
