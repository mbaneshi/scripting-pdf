SPEAKING BEING
WES
You’re going to do it your way. Now you’re not the only one in this room that’s going to do it his 
way or her way. That’s human being. And that’s the absurdity of human being. Because you’ve 
done it all your way and it took you to where you are now—no, sorry—it took you to where you 
were before The Forum. So if you tell the truth now about where you were before The Forum, 
you’ll see the eff ectiveness of doing life your way. The planet is full of people doing life their 
way. 
KEVIN
But I’ve done it more so than anybody else in this room.
WES
Always. 
KEVIN
No, I’m dead sure of that. See I have evidence. There’s only a few people here who wouldn’t 
allow themselves to be taped. And I’ve already talked to the other people. I didn’t seek them out 
after that stupid incident here. And I’m getting blocked here.
WES
You’re doing great. You’re actually getting off  it. If I hear you right: you’re willing to tell one on 
yourself, right?
KEVIN
Yeah.
WES
A person who resists a coaching conversation never gets coached. That’s 
got its...
KEVIN
You’re a great coach but, excuse me, I’ll... I’ll only take from you whatever I’m going to take. 
Everything comes through some sort of fi lter, and I only take whatever I think is okay for me, 
and the rest of it I think, for the most part you’re on the ball, but where you’re a little screwed 
up there, I’m not going to accept that. 
WES
Right, of course. I’m not saying “believe everything.” That’s not the other side of what I’m 
saying. But it’s not going along with it. We’re talking about a coaching conversation. 
KEVIN
It’s all right. I won’t let myself. I’m afraid to put myself in the hands of somebody else 
completely. Trust somebody completely.
