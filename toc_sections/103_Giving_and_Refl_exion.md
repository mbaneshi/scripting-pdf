Forum Day Two: Session One
89
The day began at 9:00 am, with Julie, The Forum Supervisor, leading the participants through the
process of fi lling out the Graduate Records form. Before the forms were collected, she asked the
participants to stop writing, and Kipp mounted the platform (T-shaped, with stairs at the end of the
center runway) and led a conversation about the Six-Day Course.* Following this hour-long conversa-
tion, Wes replaced Kipp on the platform to invite participants to share what they encountered when
doing the assignment given at the end of Day One.
WES
Good morning. We’re going to begin with sharing. Would someone repeat the three assignments
Werner gave you last night?
MAC (a participant in a wheelchair)
You’re one of the leaders of this Forum. This program has been going on for seventeen years
with hundreds of thousands of people, which means you have had many hundreds of Forums.
To keep us here to one o’clock means for me that after doing my homework I wasn’t able to
get to bed until a quarter till three. I request that you organize yourselves, as we must organize
ourselves, so that we can leave here by eleven instead of one o’clock.
WES
I got your suggestion.
MAC
But are you going to do anything about it?
WES
The Forum will probably end between eleven and one am.

DAY TWO
FORUM DAY TWO:
SESSION ONE
*
NOTE: The Six-Day Course originally was included as part of what was called the Ten-Day
Teen Training, first delivered in June 1973. In addition to the four-day est Training, six days
were devoted to various physical challenges such as riding zip-lines and repelling cliff s.
The Six-Day Course that Kipp discussed here at the beginning of Day Two of The Forum was
first delivered in March 1977 for adult graduates of the est Training, and continued to be de-
livered through the transition to The Forum in 1985, up until June 1991 when the last Six-Day
was held.
Some elements of the course were included (though significantly revised) in what became
the Landmark Advanced Course, first delivered in 1991. This course still (as of 2019) serves as the
second of four parts of Landmark’s Curriculum for Living, the other two parts of which are
The Landmark Forum in Action ten-session seminar series and The Landmark Self-Expression
and Leadership Program.

SPEAKING BEING
MAC
So you’re not going to do anything about it.
WES
No, we’re not going to follow your suggestion.
MAC
Well at least I got it off  my chest.
WES
There’s something at stake here which is much more important than an hour or so of sleep.
MAC
For some of us, sleep is important to function.
WES
Yeah, yeah, it’ll get worse.
(laughter)
Who can repeat the assignments?
(some raising their hands)
Who cannot repeat them?
(others raising their hands)
Now, who can repeat the assignment and share about it?
SIENNA
Share your experience with someone in The Forum. Bring areas to work on, inauthenticities.
And look at areas of your life where looking good uses you.
WES
Look at the possibility that looking good has used your life. Which one do you want to share
about?
SIENNA
I want to share about looking good, and the way I look good goes back to the already always
listening. I have a presence that is an act about knowing, about knowing it all.
WES
Without this distinction you are dealing with, we tend to put our knowledge and our informa-
tion in a box, and we don’t see that we use that box for something, we make the box itself right,
NOTE: See the beginning of Session Three of Day Four,
where Mac comes forward to share what he had gotten out
of the course.

and we don’t see how we use the box to be right, which makes us very ineff ective, by the way.
Whatever power knowing has, whatever power information has, the power becomes displaced
by the motivation behind the gathering of it.
SIENNA
What I do then is spend a lot of time judging whether they are acting as if they know, or acting
as if I know, even when I don’t know, which makes it very upsetting for me yesterday and this
morning, that there’s a piece of me that knows that what’s critical for me, you know Werner
said to focus on where you were upset or confused. And I’m attracted to that area in the circle
that I don’t know that I don’t know. And when I’m in my act of having to know, it is so critical
to my success that I’m willing to say that I know when I don’t. And then I miss the opportunity
to create solutions when I’m in my act “I already know.”
WES
Brilliant. She’s creating “creativity,” and she knows she can’t step into that domain, because the
very thing that keeps her from stepping into that domain is this thing, that she’s “got to know.”
t
But if you’re going to create something, you can’t know what you’re going to create. That’s
the area of creativity: you can’t step into it unless you’re willing to give up what you previ-
ously knew. This is a major issue people have a breakthrough with in the creativity seminar.
(to Sienna)
That’s great.
SIENNA
There’s another thing about the act and inauthenticity, which I have become very sophisticated
in. I decided at some point about people who are assholes, who stand up and challenge author-
ity, and I decided all that stuff  was inappropriate. And yet one of my inauthenticities is that I
walk around knowing that I know a lot more than anyone else. But if I said that, that would
mean being an asshole: and so I’ve cloaked it. But it’s worse because it’s indirect. And then I
walk around worried that people will fi nd out what I don’t want them to fi nd out about me. It’s
silly because it’s probably written all over me.
WES
They won’t acknowledge it because the unspoken agreement with your friends is that you won’t
call them on their inauthenticity and they won’t call you on yours. That’s what it means to have
a friend. You’ll let that slip by. The other agreement is that your friends are willing to listen to
your racket. Today you’ll fi nd out about your racket.
(to the group)
She is sharing an aspect of her racket. It’s a technical term. I don’t know if we mentioned it
yesterday, but here’s how to listen to people sharing in here. You should listen to the partici-
pants’ shares like that’s you in some way speaking. Even if the person sharing is female and
you’re male. The Forum is not about men and women as men and women as much as it is
92
SPEAKING BEING
about human beings. And I’m inviting you, like a possibility, to see your humanness in anybody
speaking, and let something open up for you. So who can see an aspect of themselves in what
she just shared?
(many people raising their hands)
SIENNA
I’m also, when I’m in this place of knowing and acting that way, and not being willing to say I
know more than you do, that I’m very insulated about sharing with people, like yesterday, like I
didn’t want to talk. And I felt very separated from everyone. I didn’t want to see as far as seeing
that my already listenings were similar to other people’s in the room, but I didn’t want to see that it
wasn’t even them and me. I always felt like those things were always kind of special, like the cho-
sen few and not just being human, like everybody. And that separates me, in a way that means that
I don’t share when I’m confused, and people don’t really know what’s going on with me. It’s like
I’m missing all that. I’m both missing something about being related to people, and I also see how
I’m stuck there, and that it is important, unless I want to stay here being stuck. I can’t have both.
WES
Thanks. Very useful. Look around the room. You should notice that in a Forum of about 500
people, there are probably around 20 or 25 hands up. Hands down. Here’s something you want
to get off  of real quick. It’s called participating in The Forum. It’s called sharing in The Forum.
The fi rst thing you should know is The Forum isn’t real. This is not real life. Now, we’re going to
sit here for four days, kind of in this artifi cial environment. What’s the point? The point is what
goes on after in your life. This is coaching for your life. But you’ve got to begin it here. And the
way you begin it here is to start participating, start sharing. It’s okay if you kind of mess it up a
little in here, you see, this isn’t real. But there’s something at stake in here. You have to confront
what’s at stake for you in here. She just shared something that few people ever see about them-
selves, that their life is about knowing something so as to look good. And the few people who
get that ever, get that it’s killing their life. So here’s a woman who shared something that’s going
to open up her life. That’s what’s happening in The Forum. Are you willing to participate? Okay,
who’s willing to participate?
(calling on fi ve people who stand)
PHOEBE
I was sure that with all these people putting their hands up I wouldn’t get picked. But I got picked.
WES
Yes.
PHOEBE
It was safe to do what everyone else was doing. Also, part of my act for looking good is to be
very appropriate.
Being-in-the-World: Being-With
Werner Erhard emerged into public attention during a period char-
acterized by some as a decade of Narcissism, a period when the cul-
ture’s emphasis on self-understanding and personal empowerment
led to the emergence of what has been called the “Me” generation.
As a result, Erhard’s work was sometimes tarred with that brush.
For the authors of this book, however, a significant element
of The Forum experience has been the atmosphere of aff inity and
connection with others that inevitably emerges among partic-
ipants as the course moves toward its conclusion. Certainly,
individual empowerment is a significant element of the transfor-
mation that The Forum makes available. But this empowerment is
consistently accompanied by an experience of profound related-
ness to others, which then encourages a commitment to commu-
nity contribution. To use a metaphor oft en employed by Erhard,
the individual empowerment and the sense of connection are as
symbiotic in their emergence as the front and back of a hand.
In Being and Time, Martin Heidegger locates the source of that
connection in the nature of Dasein’s Being-in-the-world.
As noted previously, Dasein, as the clearing for Being-in-
the-world, frees other beings to be the beings they are (see the
sidebar “Being-in-the-World: Being-in” in Session One of Day One,
