Forum Day Two: Session Three

ERHARD
Okay that’s what happened and that’s what you’re sad about. You had a bond with your father,
and just her presence broke that bond. What did you decide?
JANE
That I had to break the bond between them, her and me? Tell her how I feel. And tell her how I
felt that she came.
ERHARD
That’s not a strange way for a little girl to feel, now is it?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
But for a mature woman, that’s clearly not what happened, is it?
JANE
I don’t understand.
ERHARD
Looking from your point of view now, did your father’s marriage break the bond between you
and your dad?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
Can you get off  it with your stepmom about breaking the bond between you and your dad?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
So maybe you could say to your stepmom that when I was a little girl, I didn’t even realize it un-
til I saw it today, but there’s been something in the relationship between you and I. “When I was
a little girl and you came into my life, it felt like you had broken my bond with my father, but
now I see that that isn’t true. So that’s not between you and me any more. I can be fully related
to you.” How does that feel?
JANE
But I’m still sad. I don’t know what it’s about.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Whatever that’s about will come up before we’re through. You know you’ve got to be a big per-
son to have the kind of conversation we just had?
Erhard had been very gentle during this entire interaction, standing very close to Jane. Kipp then
proceeded to do the seminar program enrollment.
ERHARD (to the group)
For the dinner break there are two assignments. Observe and inquire into the real nature of
your relating to other people. What’s really going on with you when you’re relating to other
people? As you’re being with people, what’s really going on with you? And two, after dinner, I
invite you to have a conversation about the seminar program.
The Forum adjourned for a dinner break.
