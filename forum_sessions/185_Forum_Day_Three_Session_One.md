DAY THREE
Day three of The Forum began at 9:00 am, with The Forum leader, Kipp, on the platform asking
participants to share about the assignment from the previous evening: to share their experience of
The Forum with someone in their lives.
KIPP
When you talk about what happened, people are left, and you’re left, with whatever description
gives you. We’re going to call that domain of speaking “up in the stands.” Does talking to the
person next to us about what’s down on the court impact the game? Now I’m asking you to get
on the court and share from being on the court. Here’s how it starts: “Who were you with?”
“You said what?” “What did they say?”
Wearing a dark gray sweater-vest with black slacks, Erhard appeared in the back of the room,
watching the interaction.
BETTY
I phoned my brother last night, and I told him, in the beginning of him harassing me to make a
decision of being here, that I wasn’t sure of... that I blamed him...
KIPP
You said you blamed him?
BETTY
I said I blamed him. This is the conversation that we had. “I blamed you Bob for me being here
because I didn’t want to be here. It’s your fault and I hate you for it.”
KIPP (to the group)
You’re right there with her because she’s not talking about sharing, she’s sharing. You’re right
there on the phone with her. Then what did you tell him?
BETTY
I told him that I was sorry for how I felt, that I had no right to feel that way, that I was the one
who was wrong and selfi sh.
KIPP
And he said?
BETTY
He said that he loved me, and that the reason that he wanted me here was because it would be
good for me. And I told him that I didn’t want to see it from his point of view; to see it from my
point of view, and it took me to get through yesterday to realize that. I got through that point.
I realized it. I’m here. It’s great for me. And I told him that I appreciated him for making that
decision for harassing me.

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
Whether it’s convincing you or harassing you, neither ever happened. In the sense of what
happened, your brother spoke to you.
BETTY
In a sense it didn’t and in another sense it did.
KIPP
It’s called describing it. He spoke to you.
(to the group)
What she just shared with you just about never happens after two days of anything in your life.
This isn’t a new situation; this is, however, many years between her and her brother and two
days. It’s hard to be present to that; it’s hard to see because it seems like two years.
BETTY
I hated being here the fi rst two days.
KIPP
No you didn’t... You had those thoughts. Did you have anything to do with any of those
thoughts?
BETTY
No.
KIPP
No. It was like the rain.
BETTY
It was like the rain.
KIPP
Stop identifying with the rain.
ERHARD (entering the conversation)
He’s making a slightly diff erent point, and it would be useful for everybody to get it. That’s not
you thinking. The stuff  going on in your head is not yours. It doesn’t belong to you. You didn’t
invent it, or generate it. It’s thoughts you’re having. I want you to be able to think that what’s
going on when you’re thinking is not you thinking. You’re having thoughts. It thinks. I’m having
the thoughts it thinks. In the book, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat—there was such
a man—he actually thought his wife was a hat. And you mistake it thinking for you thinking.
Not you personally. People mistake it thinking for them thinking just like the guy who mistook
his wife for a hat. You have to do some thinking to get that. It thinks, and you have the thoughts
that it thinks. You want to stop being so entangled in your thinking. You want to be able to
IN-ORDER-TO
Here Erhard is characterizing the current clearing for Being as
calculative—as technological—wherein everything is placed in
reserve, standing by, ready to be used—everything including our
selves (please see the series of sidebars on technology during the
third and final session of Day Four). Since we have not recognized
the technological clearing as a paradigm, a particular way of being
which we have been sent, we see it as simply the way things—
including our selves—are. The in-order-to of standing-reserve, not
