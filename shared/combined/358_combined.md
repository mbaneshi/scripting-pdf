SPEAKING BEING
BRADLEY
Me.
ERHARD
Did you get that?
BRADLEY
No, I’m still attaching meaning to it.
ERHARD
I’m not asking whether you are attaching meaning or not attaching meaning. You’re always
going to attach meaning.
BRADLEY
I will?
ERHARD
You are a machine that attaches meaning. As long as you’re functioning you will attach mean-
ing. However, it’s possible to attach meaning in the context that it’s empty and meaningless. It’s
possible to get that it’s empty and meaningless and attach meaning to it. See, this is not a con-
versation for convincing you of something. This is a conversation for leaving you dwelling in
the truth. Dwelling in the truth, you can’t use the truth. So the question is, did you get—and by
“get” I mean: “dwelling in” that it’s empty and meaningless? By “get” I mean: Are you “coming
from” that it’s empty and meaningless? Not: Are you attaching meaning to things?
BRADLEY
Yes.
ERHARD
Then you are welcome to sit down.
(addressing Jacob, standing)
You didn’t get it, right? You got it partly and partly you didn’t get it?
JACOB
Well I understand that, um, that a lot of times we try to take things for more than their face
value, which is what happened, and add a stupid story to it and try to give it meaning. But I was
wondering about your wording. When you say that it’s empty, is that where potential comes
from, or possibility?
ERHARD
Is that where what?
primordial metaphor (see the sidebar “Primordial Metaphor”
in the Second Session of Day Four)—or, in this case, the radical
undermining of meaning, since to bring Being (originative
meaning) to language we must also bring nothing to language,
and not merely ontically: the ontological saying of the nothing is
primal rhetoric.
The second sense of “rhetoric” is closer to the Aristotelian
tradition: that is, Heidegger, and especially Erhard, use the
language of nothing strategically, exploiting its paradoxical
y
possibilities to reorient the audience by revealing to that audience
its true relation to nothing and thus to Being. ■
Forum Day Four: Session One
345
JACOB
Is that where possibility comes from, being empty?
ERHARD
It may or may not, but, in my answering you in the context in which you are asking me, that
isn’t going to make any diff erence for you, because you’re asking me in order to understand.
If you do this exercise... the way we know you did the exercise is because possibility arises.
Now I didn’t ask that question yet, we’re going to ask that question in a little while because we
need to get this other thing fl at fi rst. What we want to get fl at is not did you fi gure this out, and
does it fi t with everything you know. But rather, did you get that life is empty and meaningless
and it’s empty and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless? It has no inherent meaning,
no inherent signifi cance. Life is like a rainstorm. It does not rain in order to water the little
fl owers. It just fucking rains and life is like that. Life is just like it is. Life is just that way. It’s
not that way for a reason. It’s just that way. It’s just the way it is, and it’s just devoid of meaning
and signifi cance, except to the degree that you bring some meaning and signifi cance to it. And
the meaning and signifi cance that people bring to it does what you saw in here over the last
three days. So that’s what there is to get. What there is to get is that life is empty and meaning-
less and it’s empty and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless. That is to say, it’s not only
empty and meaningless but you can’t make something out of that without getting into trouble.
Is that clear?
JACOB
Yeah. But...
ERHARD
You’re going to screw it up trying to make up a conclusion out of it.
JACOB
Yeah I am.
ERHARD
Don’t do that. Stop that.
JACOB
Okay.
(applause)
ERHARD
It’s very important what Jacob just illustrated for you. I heard you say it goes in and out and in
and out and in and out. It goes in and out and in and out because you try to make a conclusion.
I told you the truth has no use. It’s use-less. Worth-less. What is “worth”? Worth is what makes
Life is like a rainstorm. It does not rain in order
to water the little flowers. It just fucking rains
and life is like that. Life is just like it is. Life is
just that way. It’s not that way for a reason.
It’s just that way. It’s just the way it is, and it’s
just devoid of meaning and significance, except
to the degree that you bring some meaning
and significance to it. And the meaning and
significance that people bring to it does what
you saw in here over the last three days.
“
346
SPEAKING BEING
you right. That’s the only thing that’s worth anything. Something that makes you right; that’s
worth something. Something that makes somebody or something else wrong; that’s worth
something. Something with which you can dominate; that’s worth something. Something with
which you can avoid domination; that’s worth something. Something you can justify yourself
with or invalidate others; that’s worth something.
(loudly)
The truth isn’t worth anything. It’s worthless because you can’t use it. And the instant you try to
draw a conclusion from it, you make a “therefore”; you put a “therefore” behind the truth and
it sucks all the truth out of it. It’s no longer true; it is now more bullshit. You stumble across the
truth, you happen to bump into it, leave it alone. By leave it alone I don’t mean walk away from
it, or ignore it, I mean: let it be. Is that clear? You want to take that page out of Jacob’s book,
and it will move things forward here more rapidly. And we won’t still be here Monday morn-
ing.
(Jacob sits as Erhard addresses another standing participant)
You did not get that it’s empty and meaningless?
DENNIS
I want to believe that I’m getting it, but I’m not getting it.
ERHARD
What is it that you’re not getting?
DENNIS
That life is empty and meaningless.
ERHARD
Okay. What is the meaning of life?
DENNIS
I don’t know. That’s what I’m here for.
WES
I’m now going to tell you. You want to know the meaning of life? Let me tell you the meaning
of life, and then you’ll know the meaning of life and you’ll see the diff erence it makes in your
life.
Wes got a dictionary from the table and read from it the defi nition of “life”: “The property or quality
that distinguishes living organisms from dead organisms...etc.”
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day Four: Session One
347
ERHARD
It’s all clear now, isn’t it? It’s all clear now. Absolutely. That cleared it all up, now didn’t it? Go
on Wes.
(after much laughter, Wes continues to read several defi nitions of “life”)
It’s all clear now isn’t it?
DENNIS
No it’s not...
ERHARD
Listen up. You’ve got a hidden standard for getting it. Did you hear what I said? You’ve got a
hidden standard for getting it. It’s kind of like, when I hear the angels trumpet then I’ll know
I got it. So you want to get that standard up on the mat in order to be able to get it. What’s the
standard? How are you going to know when you got it?
DENNIS
I guess when I hear my bells ring.
KIPP
He wants the bells. We’ll give him the bells.
ERHARD
Listen, now. This is it.
KIPP
We’re going to demonstrate something so that every time you give signifi cance to your life, you
can see what life really means.
Kipp opened a dictionary and balanced it on his head. Then he held a chalkboard eraser in each
hand and walked around the room through the group, very solemnly clapping the two erasers to-
gether and dispensing eraser dust like the incense in a church processional. He approached Dennis
and clapped the erasers directly in front of him, as if dispensing a blessing. The room broke out into
extended applause and laughter.
ERHARD (to the group)
You understand he was illustrating you all; you’re just covert about it. That’s what you look like
when you stand in the truth. Is that silly enough? Think you’ll remember that? When you’re
pontifi cating, you want to remember that’s what you look like.
(to Dennis)
See: You’re wanting to make some signifi cance out of getting it.
348
SPEAKING BEING
DENNIS
That’s correct.
ERHARD
And getting it is to get that there is no signifi cance. So there can’t be any signifi cance in getting
it. You want to know where you’ve got your foot nailed to the fl oor? When you were younger
somebody told you some bullshit about what it was to get it. What were you told when you were
young about what it was to be enlightened, to get it?
DENNIS
I was brought up believing that one should be successful and make things happen for yourself,
to be in control.
ERHARD
Yeah, and you know that was the product of the culture in which you were brought up, and
family in which you were brought up, and the time of history in which you were brought up.
And you know, there are cultures in which success is looked down upon, in which you have to
hide your success. You know that, right?
DENNIS
Sure.
ERHARD
Sure. So what’s the signifi cance of that? I mean, which is right? Which is the right way to
go? Is the right way to go and devote your life to success, or to devote your life to something
else? Which is the right way to go? Do you see that the question is insane? You go the way you
go. The question whether it is right or wrong is irrelevant, stupid, is stupefying. Look at how
stupid it made you. That was not an insult. It was just a report. Look at the stupidity that you’ve
revealed in your own lives. You know, the “at the heart of it” stupidity. Yeah there’s nothing
wrong with being oriented around and regarding being successful or accomplishment highly.
DENNIS
Yeah but, I feel like... I don’t consider myself overly successful, but somewhat successful, like
you said...
ERHARD
Here’s how successful you are. I’ve seen your bank account: You’re as successful as you are.
That’s how successful you are and it’ll probably remain like that. No matter how much you
accomplish, you will only be as successful as you are, and you will not be as successful as you
aren’t. And that’s the way it’s going to be for the rest of your life. Right? It’s like “who’s buried
in Grant’s tomb?”
Forum Day Four: Session One
349
DENNIS
Sure I can buy that.
ERHARD
Grant is buried in Grant’s tomb, and that’s about how complex this whole thing is. Things are
the way they are and things are not the way that they are not, and they are always like that and
they don’t change.
DENNIS
See, I have a hard time... I want to believe, Werner...
ERHARD
I appreciate that...
DENNIS
...but it’s like, I came here with some conceptions that... “Okay, I am here, because I feel fi ne.
I am successful. There are certain things wrong I would like to fi x.” Sitting here, wanting to
believe, but I’m hearing, “let it be.”
ERHARD
I never said “let it be.” That’s somebody else’s horseshit. I never said “let it be,” because you
can’t do anything but let it be--and pretend that you’re doing something else. What I said is
“what is, is, and what isn’t, isn’t.” That’s mine. That’s pretty goddamned safe. I’ll take on any-
body who wants to attack me on that one.
DENNIS
No, I’m not trying to attack you...
ERHARD
No, no, I know you’re not trying to attack me. I did not mean to imply that, and I’m sorry if it
sounded like I did.
DENNIS
No, I’m just trying...
ERHARD
You’re trying to hear bells. All you’re going to hear is simplicity.
DENNIS
Yeah, I guess I came here thinking that four days and three hours on the fi fth day is going to
make a diff erence in my life. I just can’t go home and quit and say the rest will be history. You
have to go back to your life.
350
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Nobody said “quit.” Okay go on.
DENNIS
Right, I know. When I try to make sense out of believing there is no meaning...
ERHARD
No, I don’t want you to believe that there’s no meaning; that would make you crazy.
DENNIS
Yeah, if I went home and said that life doesn’t make any sense, it doesn’t mean anything...
ERHARD
I didn’t say it doesn’t make any sense. I said it’s empty and meaningless, and it’s empty and
meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless. That’s all I’ve said. And if you went home and
said it’s empty and meaningless and it’s empty and meaningless that it’s empty and meaning-
less, you would get into trouble. See, just like I would get into trouble if I said that to people
who didn’t pay me $625. And I don’t say it to people who don’t pay me $625, and then I don’t
say it until the third day. Don’t tell people life is empty and meaningless, because they can’t
hear you. They can’t hear that because it’s all the way down at the bottom. Where are they?
They’re all the way up at the top. They’re fl oating on all that soap opera and drama, all those
rackets and all that act. They can’t see down through the murk that it’s empty and meaning-
less. What you’ve been through is designed to take you down one layer at a time, until you can
get far enough down so that you can see that all the way down it’s empty and meaningless.
And it’s very, very diffi  cult to get down there because you can’t use that. And that’s kind of
what you’re complaining about. It didn’t leave you feeling wonderful. It didn’t leave you free
and easy and wonderful, and it never does until you get there. The secret is perfectly hidden.
That’s why almost nobody gets it. It’s why it took three days, four days of hammering to get you
close to getting it. And you may not get it. But I want you to know something: That’s all there is
to get here. What there is to get for your $625, and the four days and three hours crushing your
backside, is that life is empty and meaningless, and that it’s empty and meaningless that it’s
empty and meaningless. And that the soap opera you’ve made out of your life is a very bad joke.
It’s a bad joke. You’ve made everything signifi cant and meaningful and it’s caused you to suff er.
And not only the bad things, but you suff er the good things, because the good things don’t
leave you fulfi lled and whole and complete. They don’t leave you full of joy and satisfi ed. So
you not only suff er the bad things, you suff er the good things as well. Your life is nothing but
suff ering. And the source of suff ering is a lie. There’s only one source of suff ering. The source
of suff ering is a lie. Stop lying and you’ll stop suff ering. And the fundamental lie is that it all
means something, that it’s going to work out, that you’re going to make it someday, that you’re
going to get there, that someday the fairy prince is going to come along, or the fairy princess is
going to come along, or someday the right job, or someday the right life, or someday the right
body. That’s the lie that keeps the suff ering in place. When you get to empty and meaningless
you get that there’s no more suff ering. All there is, is possibility. Freedom. Openness. But you
Your life is nothing but suff ering. And the
source of suff ering is a lie. There’s only one
source of suff ering. The source of suff ering is a
lie. Stop lying and you’ll stop suff ering. And the
fundamental lie is that it all means something,
that it’s going to work out, that you’re going
to make it someday, that you’re going to get
there, that someday the fairy prince is going
to come along, or the fairy princess is going
to come along, or someday the right job, or
someday the right life, or someday the right
body. That’s the lie that keeps the suff ering
in place.

can’t get to empty and meaningless in-order-to. And every time you turn it into an in-order-to,
you lose that it’s empty and meaningless, because the truth is sucked out of it, and it becomes a
mere platitude.
DENNIS
I just want to end with saying that I will leave here with the thought that life is empty and
meaningless and that opens up a possibility.
ERHARD
I don’t want you to leave with “it opens up a possibility.” That ruins it.
DENNIS
Is that an in-order-to?
ERHARD
Yeah. See, you’re a real in-order-to guy. That’s not bad. That’s not an insult. That’s highly valued
in this culture. We place a lot of value in this culture in in-order-to.
DENNIS
Thank you.
ERHARD
Yep. Very good. Thank you.
(applause)
(turning to another participant)
What is your story?
JOYCE
My story is that I get it and I reject it.
ERHARD
Okay. Don’t do that. What are you crying about? Do you know? Yeah, you know, what are you
crying about?
JOYCE
Because I came to make a change in my life and I don’t see it happening.
ERHARD
Yes. I understand. So, you wanted to make a change in your life because there’s a little suff er-
ing there, yes? Yeah. The way to perpetuate the suff ering is to try to change your life. You stop
changing your life, the suff ering will go away. Is that clear?
352
SPEAKING BEING
JOYCE
Yes. It’s clear.
ERHARD
So, don’t do that anymore. Cut that out. Stop rejecting it. Stop trying to get better. Stop trying to
change your life. What is it you want out of life, that’s so goddamned important that you want
to change your life? What is it that’s bothering you because it’s missing?
JOYCE
I want to like myself. I don’t like myself.
ERHARD
Okay. Now. Start not liking yourself. Do that right now. Don’t like yourself right now.
(Joyce laughing)
What are you smiling about? I thought you said you didn’t like yourself.
(laughter)
Don’t like yourself some more. This is pretty good. Now don’t like yourself even more. You
notice everything changed. Now like yourself. Like yourself.
JOYCE
It’s not diff erent.
ERHARD
It’s no fucking diff erent is it?
(laughter)
Liking yourself and not liking yourself are the same thing: It’s all bullshit.
(raising his voice to a pitch)
What is this goddamned fantasy about liking yourself? What in the fuck is that? That’s crazy!
That’s like walking around saying “Don’t look! Don’t look! Oh my God there’s a man back there
following me with a knife with blood dripping down.” Bullshit people made up: liking your-
self/not liking yourself. You know what not liking yourself is? It’s a conversation you have with
yourself. Bullshit people made up, this “liking yourself/not liking yourself.” You know what
not liking yourself is? It’s a conversation you have with yourself.
JOYCE
It’s a conversation I constantly have with myself.
ERHARD
Yeah, but stop it then. This is craziness. What is the signifi cance of liking yourself or not liking
yourself? Does it change a hair on your head?
Forum Day Four: Session One
353
JOYCE
It doesn’t change anything externally.
ERHARD
It doesn’t change anything. It doesn’t change any little thing. It changes absolutely nothing. It’s
a bullshit conversation. It’s like talking about “Which way is left?”
(to Joyce)
Which way is left?
(she points to her left)
No, that’s right.
JOYCE
No, it’s not right.
ERHARD
It is so right!
JOYCE
To you.
ERHARD
But do you see how nonsensical this conversation is between you and me now?
JOYCE
Yes.
ERHARD
Liking yourself and not liking yourself is just as nonsensical. You got conned into some bullshit
conversation.
JOYCE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Did you ever hear people on drugs talking? They’re like, nutty. Like myself/don’t like myself is
the same crap. “Whoa. Sha? Go man! Jack Damn!” What does all that shit mean?
(laughter)
It’s all drama, drama. You ever been to the movies?
354
SPEAKING BEING
JOYCE
Yeah.
ERHARD
People are acting up there. It’s not for real. This is your act, not liking yourself. It’s your act.
JOYCE
I get that. I get that I put on an act.
ERHARD
There’s nothing to like or not like. What does that mean: like or don’t like? You are the way you
are. That’s the whole story, isn’t it?
JOYCE
Yeah.
ERHARD
And you’re always going to be the way you are. And you’re going to be the way you are when
you are the way you are. Today you are the way you are today. Tomorrow you’ll be like the way
you’ll be tomorrow. And the day after that you’ll be like you are the day after that. And that’s
going to be true for the rest of your life. What is this conversation like or don’t like yourself?
What does this mean? This is insane this conversation I like, I don’t like. And you ought to be
able to begin to see the insanity of it. It’s like really insane. What is it about, for God’s sake?
What is the point? The point is drama, like soap opera. You know, you use life to make a soap
opera: that’s disgusting. Life is empty and meaningless. It’s just like that.
JOYCE
I see that. It doesn’t make any diff erence whether I like myself or not. But I’m stuck. I want to
like myself.
ERHARD
But no. Let me ask you something. Listen up you all! What happens when you raise the issue of
liking yourself? What has to go with the issue of liking yourself? Must. What is it that has to be
there in order for you to like yourself? There’s only one thing that has got to be there for you to
have the issue of liking yourself.
JOYCE
What would have to go with it?
ERHARD
Yeah. What is it that has to be there in order for you to like yourself? There’s only one thing
that’s got to be there.
Forum Day Four: Session One
355
JOYCE
Not liking yourself?
ERHARD
Yeah. Obvious, huh? You can’t have liking yourself without not liking yourself. Get rid of both
of them. It’s a bullshit conversation. There’s nothing in there. It’s pure drama.
JOYCE
It’s arguing with yourself.
ERHARD
It’s like arguing if you’re blue or green. Are you blue or green?
JOYCE
I’m neither.
ERHARD
Absolutely. It’s like, are you likable or unlikable? It’s like asking you if you’re blue or green.
It’s the same kind of question. Are you blue or green? It’s nonsense. It’s garbage, and if you
ask garbage questions you get garbage answers. Every time someone likes theirself, what gets
reinforced?
JOYCE
I don’t know.
ERHARD
Not liking theirself. Don’t you see that you can’t have a lot of liking yourself and just a little
bit of not liking yourself? They got to be exactly even, because you can’t build liking yourself
except in contrast to not liking yourself.
JOYCE
You’re saying to throw both of them away.
ERHARD
Yeah. This is a garbage question liking yourself/not liking yourself. Cut that out. Hold some-
body’s hand; look up at the sky; go make something happen: But don’t waste your time with the
question of liking yourself or not liking yourself. That’s your racket.
JOYCE  (weeping)
One of my rackets...
356
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Right: and a signifi cant racket for you. What you have to get to is that it’s empty and meaning-
less. Underneath your racket is all empty and meaningless. If I take away liking yourself and
not liking yourself, what are you left with? Nothing. There’s where we want to leave you: with
nothing. Is that clearer?
JOYCE
Yeah, but I don’t want to be left with nothing.
ERHARD
I know, because there’s a payoff  in not liking yourself. You’re getting something out of it. You’re
a racketeer. You’re in it for the payoff .
JOYCE
Yes, I am.
ERHARD
Yeah. You like the payoff , be my guest.
JOYCE
No I don’t like it.
ERHARD
Then cut it out. And if you can’t cut it out, where you need to get to is that underneath the
racket is empty and meaningless. You have to see that your racket’s a joke. You’re not going to
get rid of your racket, ever. You get rid of one, you’ll fi nd another one under that. It’s endless.
It’s rackets all the way down, I told you. It’s like peeling an onion. You take off  one racket, you
get another racket. You take off  another racket, you get another racket. You know what’s at the
center of an onion? Nothing. When you pull the last layer off , what’s left? Nothing. Sorry for the
cheap metaphor. Life is empty and meaningless and it doesn’t mean anything that life is empty
and meaningless. Did you get it? I didn’t say “did you feel good?” I said “did you get it?”
JOYCE
Life is empty and meaningless that life is empty and meaningless means nothing.
ERHARD
No. It’s life is empty and meaningless and that doesn’t mean anything. Don’t give any meaning
to that. See, you’re trying to make that mean something. Like, “Well, then I shouldn’t have to
bother!” No. It doesn’t mean anything; you can’t make meaning out of it, otherwise you destroy
it. And as soon as you do make it mean something you take the truth power out of it; you take
the truth value out of it. Then it becomes some stupid platitude that you bother people with.
“Don’t you know that life is empty and meaningless?” People don’t want to hear that shit.
Forum Day Four: Session One
357
(laughter)
Don’t go around telling people life is empty and meaningless. Live your life from it. Don’t tell
people that. So what there is to get is that life is empty and meaningless and that that doesn’t
have any meaning. That is to say: the fact that life is empty and meaningless is empty and
meaningless. It’s just empty and meaningless.
JOYCE
I get that.
ERHARD
Okay, that’s all there is to get for the moment. I didn’t say you have to feel good.
Erhard continued working one by one with the people who had stood because they did not get that
life is empty and meaningless.
ERHARD  (to another participant)
What is your problem?
SALLY
I’m having a hard time with life being empty and meaningless that life is empty and
meaningless.
ERHARD
Let me make it easy for you. Life is empty and meaningless: Did you get that part?
SALLY
Yes.
ERHARD
What does that mean? What is the signifi cance of that statement?
SALLY
That it’s empty and meaningless, but I’m sitting here thinking, “Fuck it! Who cares?”
ERHARD
No, you just made it mean something. You didn’t get it because you made it mean something.
You said, “well if it’s empty and meaningless then...” See, once you said “then,” you didn’t get
it; you ruined it. Is that clear what I just said?
SALLY
Yeah, then it becomes something. Then it means something.

سپس شما از نشستن استقبال می کنید. (خطاب به یعقوب ، ایستاده)
شما آن را دریافت نکردید ، درست است؟ شما آن را تا حدودی و جزئی دریافت نکردید؟ ژاکت
خوب من این را می فهمم ، هوم ، که بسیاری از اوقات سعی می کنیم چیزهایی را برای چهره آنها بکشیم
ارزش ، این همان اتفاقی است که افتاده است ، و یک داستان احمقانه به آن اضافه می کنید و سعی می کنید آن را معنی دهید. اما من بودم
تعجب در مورد جمله خود. وقتی می گویید خالی است ، این است که در جایی که پتانسیل وجود دارد
از ، یا احتمال؟ درز
آیا این جایی است؟ استعاره اولیه (به نوار کناری "استعاره اولیه" مراجعه کنید
در جلسه دوم روز چهارم) - در این حالت ، رادیکال
تضعیف معنا ، از آنجا که وجود دارد (مبداء
معنی) به زبان ما نیز باید چیزی به زبان بیاوریم ،
و نه صرفاً به صورت داخلی: گفته هستی شناختی هیچ چیز نیست
بلاغت اولیه. حس دوم "بلاغت" به ارسطویی نزدیکتر است
سنت: یعنی هایدگر و به ویژه Erhard از آن استفاده کنید
زبان هیچ چیز استراتژیک ، سوءاستفاده از پارادوکسیکال آن
حرف
امکاناتی برای تغییر مکان مخاطبان با آشکار کردن آن مخاطب
رابطه واقعی آن با هیچ چیز و از این رو بودن. ■

ژاکت
آیا این امکان وجود دارد ، خالی بودن؟ درز
ممکن است باشد یا نه ، اما ، در پاسخ من به شما در زمینه ای که از من می پرسید ، که
نمی خواهد هیچ مشکلی برای شما ایجاد کند ، زیرا از من می خواهید که درک کنم. اگر این تمرین را انجام دهید ... روشی که می دانیم تمرین را انجام داده اید به این دلیل است که احتمال بوجود می آید. اکنون من هنوز این سؤال را نپرداختم ، ما می خواهیم این سؤال را در مدتی بپرسیم زیرا ما
باید این چیز دیگر را در ابتدا بدست آورید. آنچه ما می خواهیم FL را بدست آوریم این نیست که آیا این را از بین بردید ، و
آیا با هر آنچه می دانید این کار است. بلکه آیا این زندگی را خالی و بی معنی است
و خالی و بی معنی است که خالی و بی معنی است؟ معنای ذاتی ندارد ،
هیچ کنسرو قابل توجه ذاتی نیست. زندگی مانند طوفان باران است. به منظور آب دادن کمی باران نمی بارد
Fl Owers. این فقط باران های لعنتی و زندگی مانند آن است. زندگی دقیقاً مانند آن است. زندگی دقیقاً به همین ترتیب است. این است
نه به همین دلیل. این درست است این فقط به همان شکلی است که وجود دارد ، و فقط عاری از معنی است
و نشانه گذاری ، به جز در حدی که معنایی و معناداری به آن می آورید. وت
معنی و معنی دار که مردم به آن می آورند آنچه را که شما در اینجا دیدید در آخرین مورد انجام می دهد
سه روز بنابراین این همان چیزی است که می توان دریافت کرد. آنچه برای بدست آوردن وجود دارد این است که زندگی خالی و معنی دارد-
کمتر و خالی و بی معنی است که خالی و بی معنی است. این بدان معنی است که ، نه تنها
خالی و بی معنی است اما شما نمی توانید چیزی را از آن خارج کنید بدون اینکه دچار مشکل شوید. آیا این واضح است؟ ژاکت
بله اما ... erhard
شما می خواهید آن را امتحان کنید و سعی در نتیجه گیری از آن دارید. ژاکت
بله من هستم درز
این کار را نکنید این کار را متوقف کنید. ژاکت
خوب (تشویق)
درز
این بسیار مهم است که یعقوب فقط برای شما نشان داده است. من شنیدم که می گویید داخل و خارج می شود و داخل
و خارج و داخل و خارج وارد و خارج می شود و داخل و خارج می شود زیرا سعی می کنید نتیجه بگیرید. من به شما گفتم حقیقت فایده ای ندارد. این کمتر است ارزش کمتر "ارزش" چیست؟ ارزش چیزی است که ایجاد می کند
زندگی مانند طوفان باران است. به ترتیب باران نمی بارد
برای آب دادن به گلهای کوچک. فقط باران های لعنتی
و زندگی اینگونه است. زندگی دقیقاً مانند آن است. زندگی است
درست از این راه این به یک دلیل نیست. این درست است این فقط به همان شکلی است که هست ، و
فقط عاری از معنی و اهمیت است ، به جز
تا حدی که معنایی به ارمغان می آورید
و اهمیت آن و معنی و
اهمیتی که مردم به آن می آورند چه کاری انجام می دهد
شما طی سه روز گذشته اینجا را دیدید. "

وجود
شما درست است این تنها چیزی است که ارزش هر چیزی را دارد. چیزی که شما را درست می کند ؛ یعنی
ارزش چیزی چیزی که باعث می شود کسی یا چیز دیگری اشتباه کند. این ارزش دارد
چیزی چیزی که با آن می توانید بر آن مسلط شوید. این ارزش چیزی دارد چیزی با
که می توانید از سلطه خودداری کنید. این ارزش چیزی دارد چیزی که می توانید خود را توجیه کنید
با دیگران یا بی اعتبار کردن ؛ این ارزش چیزی دارد (با صدای بلند)
حقیقت ارزش چیزی ندارد. این بی ارزش است زیرا شما نمی توانید از آن استفاده کنید. و لحظه ای که سعی می کنید
نتیجه گیری از آن ، شما یک "بنابراین" می کنید. شما یک "بنابراین" را در پشت حقیقت قرار داده اید و
این همه حقیقت را از آن می خورد. این دیگر درست نیست ؛ اکنون این گلوله تر است. شما در سراسر
حقیقت ، شما اتفاق می افتد که به آن دست و پنجه نرم می کنید ، آن را تنها بگذارید. تنها با رها کردن آن منظورم از راه دور نیست
منظورم این است که ، یا آن را نادیده بگیرید. آیا این واضح است؟ شما می خواهید آن صفحه را از کتاب یعقوب خارج کنید ،
و این همه چیز را با سرعت بیشتری به جلو سوق می دهد. و ما هنوز دوشنبه صبح اینجا نخواهیم بود-
در (Jacob در حالی که Erhard خطاب به یکی دیگر از شرکت کنندگان ایستاده است)
شما دریافت نکردید که خالی و بی معنی است؟ دنیس
من می خواهم باور کنم که من آن را دریافت می کنم ، اما من آن را دریافت نمی کنم. درز
چه چیزی است که شما نمی گیرید؟ دنیس
که زندگی خالی و بی معنی است. درز
خوب معنی زندگی چیست؟ دنیس
من نمی دانم این همان چیزی است که من برای اینجا هستم. وهمی
من الان می خواهم به شما بگویم. شما می خواهید معنی زندگی را بدانید؟ بگذارید معنی را برای شما تعریف کنم
از زندگی ، و سپس معنای زندگی را می دانید و تفاوت هایی را که در شما ایجاد می کند مشاهده خواهید کرد
زندگی وس فرهنگ لغت را از جدول گرفت و از آن خواسته "زندگی" را خواند: "خاصیت یا کیفیت
این موجودات زنده را از موجودات مرده و غیره متمایز می کند. "
erhard (ادامه)
روز چهارم: جلسه یک
347
درز
اکنون همه واضح است ، اینطور نیست؟ اکنون همه واضح است کاملا این همه چیز را پاک کرد ، حالا اینطور نیست؟ رفتن
در وس (پس از خنده زیاد ، وس همچنان به خواندن چندین مورد "زندگی" ادامه می دهد)
اکنون همه واضح است که اینطور نیست؟ دنیس
نه این نیست ... erhard
گوش کن شما یک استاندارد پنهان برای دریافت آن دارید. آیا آنچه را که گفتم شنیدی؟ شما یک
استاندارد پنهان برای دریافت آن. این نوع مانند است ، وقتی من صدای فرشتگان را می شنوم ، می دانم
من آن را دریافت کردم بنابراین می خواهید آن استاندارد را روی تشک بگیرید تا بتوانید آن را بدست آورید. چیست
استاندارد؟ چگونه می خواهید بدانید که وقتی آن را گرفتید؟ دنیس
حدس می زنم وقتی زنگ هایم را می شنوم. کله
او زنگ ها را می خواهد. ما زنگ ها را به او خواهیم داد. درز
اکنون گوش دهید. این است کله
ما می خواهیم چیزی را نشان دهیم به طوری
می تواند ببیند زندگی واقعاً به چه معناست. کیپ یک فرهنگ لغت باز کرد و آن را روی سر خود متعادل کرد. سپس او یک پاک کن تخته سیاه را در هر یک نگه داشت
دست و دور اتاق از طریق گروه قدم زد ، و به طور جدی دو پاک کننده را به هم می چسباند
گرد و غبار پاک کن مانند بخور دادن در یک محاصره کلیسا. او به دنیس نزدیک شد
و پاک کننده ها را مستقیماً در مقابل او قرار داد ، گویی که یک نعمت را توزیع می کند. اتاق وارد شد
تشویق و خنده طولانی. erhard (به گروه)
شما می فهمید که او همه شما را نشان می داد. شما فقط در مورد آن پنهان هستید. این همان چیزی است که شما به نظر می رسید
وقتی در حقیقت ایستاده اید. آیا این به اندازه کافی احمقانه است؟ فکر می کنید آن را به یاد خواهید آورد؟ وقتی تو هستی
پونتیفی ، شما می خواهید به یاد داشته باشید که این چیزی است که به نظر می رسید. (به دنیس)
مشاهده کنید: شما می خواهید از دریافت آن برخی از کنسروهای مهم را بیرون بیاورید. 348
وجود
دنیس
این درست است درز
و این است که به این نتیجه برسید که هیچ کنسرو قابل توجهی وجود ندارد. بنابراین نمی توان هیچ گونه مهمی در گرفتن وجود داشت
آن شما می خواهید بدانید که پای خود را از کجا میخ زده اید؟ وقتی جوان تر بودی
کسی در مورد آنچه که برای به دست آوردن آن بود به شما گفتند. وقتی به شما گفته شد
جوان در مورد آنچه که باید روشنگری شود ، برای به دست آوردن آن؟ دنیس
من اعتقاد داشتم که باید موفق باشید و اتفاقاتی را برای خودتان انجام دهید ،
کنترل شود درز
بله ، و می دانید که این محصول فرهنگی بود که در آن پرورش داده اید ، و
خانواده ای که در آن پرورش داده اید ، و زمان تاریخ که در آن پرورش یافته اید. و می دانید ، فرهنگ هایی وجود دارند که موفقیت در آن مورد بررسی قرار می گیرد ، که در آن شما باید
موفقیت خود را پنهان کنید. شما این را می دانید ، درست است؟ دنیس
مطمئناً درز
مطمئناً بنابراین ، کانس قابل توجه آن چیست؟ منظورم این است که درست است؟ که راه درست برای
برو؟ راه درست برای رفتن و اختصاص زندگی خود به موفقیت است یا زندگی خود را به چیزی اختصاص دهید
دیگری؟ کدام راه صحیح است؟ آیا می بینید که این سوال مجنون است؟ شما راه خود را می روید
برو این سؤال که آیا درست یا غلط است بی ربط ، احمقانه است ، احمقانه است. نگاه کنید به چگونه
احمقانه باعث شد شما این توهین نبود. این فقط یک گزارش بود. به حماقت مورد نظر خود نگاه کنید
در زندگی خود فاش شده است. می دانید ، حماقت "در قلب آن". بله هیچ چیز وجود ندارد
اشتباه در جهت گیری و موفقیت در موفقیت یا موفقیت. دنیس
بله ، اما ، من احساس می کنم ... من خودم را بیش از حد موفق نمی دانم ، اما تا حدودی موفق ، مانند
تو گفتی ... erhard
در اینجا چقدر موفق هستید. من حساب بانکی شما را دیده ام: شما به اندازه خود موفق هستید. این چقدر موفق هستید و احتمالاً مانند آن باقی خواهد ماند. مهم نیست که چقدر شما
به موفقیت ، شما فقط به همان اندازه موفق خواهید بود و به اندازه خود موفق نخواهید شد
نیستند و این راهی است که تا آخر عمر شما خواهد بود. درست است؟ مثل "چه کسی دفن شده است
در مقبره گرانت؟ "
روز چهارم: جلسه یک
349
دنیس
مطمئناً من می توانم آن را بخرم. درز
گرانت در مقبره گرانت دفن می شود ، و این در مورد این است که این همه چیز پیچیده است. چیزها هستند
روشی که آنها هستند و همه چیز به شکلی نیست که نباشند ، و همیشه مانند آن و
آنها تغییر نمی کنند. دنیس
ببینید ، من کار سختی دارم ... می خواهم باور کنم ، ورنر ... erhard
من از آن قدردانی می کنم ... دنیس
... اما به نظر می رسد ، من با برخی از تصورات به اینجا آمده ام که ... "خوب ، من اینجا هستم ، زیرا احساس می کنم موفق هستم. من موفق هستم. موارد خاصی وجود دارد که می خواهم از آن استفاده کنم." در اینجا نشسته ، مایل به
باور کنید ، اما من می شنوم ، "بگذارید این باشد."
درز
من هرگز نگفتم "بگذار باشه." این نعل اسب شخص دیگری است. من هرگز نگفتم "بگذار باشه" چون تو
نمی توانید کاری انجام دهید اما اجازه دهید این باشد-و وانمود کنید که شما کار دیگری انجام می دهید. آنچه من گفتم این است
"چیست ، و آنچه نیست ، نیست." این مال من است این بسیار خوب است. من هر
جسمی که می خواهد به آن یکی حمله کند. دنیس
نه ، من سعی نمی کنم به شما حمله کنم ... erhard
نه ، نه ، من می دانم که شما سعی نمی کنید به من حمله کنید. منظور من این نبود که دلالت کنم ، و متاسفم اگر این کار باشد
به نظر می رسید مثل من دنیس
نه ، من فقط سعی می کنم ... erhard
شما سعی می کنید زنگ ها را بشنوید. تنها چیزی که می خواهید بشنوید سادگی است. دنیس
بله ، من حدس می زنم که من به اینجا آمده ام که فکر می کنم چهار روز و سه ساعت در روز فیم می گذرد
در زندگی من تفاوت ایجاد کنید. من فقط نمی توانم به خانه بروم و ترک کنم و می گویم بقیه تاریخ خواهد بود. شما
باید به زندگی خود برگردید. 350
وجود
درز
هیچ کس نگفت "ترک". خوب ادامه دهید دنیس
درست است ، من می دانم هنگامی که من سعی می کنم از اعتقاد به این که معنا پیدا کنم معنا پیدا کنم ... erhard
نه ، من نمی خواهم که شما باور کنید که هیچ معنایی وجود ندارد. این شما را دیوانه می کند. دنیس
بله ، اگر من به خانه می رفتم و گفتم که زندگی معنی ندارد ، به معنای چیزی نیست ... erhard
من نگفتم که این معنی ندارد. گفتم خالی و بی معنی است ، و خالی است و
بی معنی است که خالی و بی معنی است. این تنها چیزی است که من گفتم و اگر به خانه رفتید و
گفت این خالی و بی معنی است و خالی و بی معنی است که خالی و معنی دارد-
کمتر ، شما دچار مشکل می شوید. ببینید ، درست مثل اینکه اگر این را به مردم می گفتم دچار مشکل می شوم
چه کسی به من 625 دلار پرداخت نکرد. و من آن را به افرادی نمی گویم که به من 625 دلار پرداخت نمی کنند ، و من نمی کنم
آن را تا روز سوم بگویید. نگویید زندگی مردم خالی و بی معنی است ، زیرا آنها نمی توانند
شما را می شنوم آنها نمی توانند این را بشنوند زیرا این همه در پایین است. آنها کجا هستند؟ آنها همه راه در بالا هستند. آنها در تمام آن اپرا و درام صابون ، همه آن ها قرار دارند
راکت ها و تمام آن عمل. آنها نمی توانند از طریق مورس که خالی و معنی دارد- ببینند-
کمتر آنچه از طریق آن گذشتید به گونه ای طراحی شده است که شما را به طور همزمان یک لایه پایین بیاورید تا بتوانید
به اندازه کافی دور شوید تا ببینید که تمام راه پایین آن خالی و بی معنی است. و این یک فرقه بسیار متفاوت است که به آنجا بروید زیرا نمی توانید از آن استفاده کنید. و این نوع است
آنچه از آن شکایت می کنید این احساس فوق العاده ای به شما نداد. شما را آزاد نکرد
و آسان و فوق العاده ، و تا زمانی که به آنجا نرسید ، هرگز این کار را نمی کند. راز کاملاً پنهان است. به همین دلیل تقریباً هیچ کس آن را دریافت نمی کند. به همین دلیل سه روز ، چهار روز چکش زدن طول کشید تا شما را بدست آورد
نزدیک به گرفتن آن و ممکن است آن را دریافت نکنید. اما من می خواهم شما چیزی را بدانید: این همه وجود دارد
برای رسیدن به اینجا آنچه برای 625 دلار خود وجود دارد ، و چهار روز و سه ساعت خرد کردن شما
پشت ، این است که زندگی خالی و بی معنی است ، و این خالی و بی معنی است که این است
خالی و بی معنی. و اینکه اپرا صابون که از زندگی خود ساخته اید ، یک شوخی بسیار بد است. این یک شوخی بد است شما همه چیز را قابل توجه و معنی دار کرده اید و این باعث شده است که شما را از بین ببرید. و نه تنها چیزهای بد ، بلکه شما چیزهای خوب را نیز تحمل می کنید ، زیرا چیزهای خوب این کار را نمی کنند
شما را به صورت کامل و کامل و کامل رها کنید. آنها شما را پر از شادی و رضایت نمی دهند. اینقدر
شما نه تنها از چیزهای بد رنج می برید ، بلکه چیزهای خوبی را نیز تحمل می کنید. زندگی شما چیزی نیست جز
کافی است و منبع کافی دروغ است. فقط یک منبع کافی وجود دارد. منبع
از نظر کافی دروغ است. دروغ گفتن را متوقف کنید و از بین خواهید برد. و دروغ اساسی این است که همه
به معنای چیزی است ، که این کار را انجام می دهد ، که شما می خواهید روزی آن را بسازید ، که هستید
رفتن به آنجا ، که روزی شاهزاده پری در حال آمدن است ، یا شاهزاده خانم پری است
رفتن به همراه ، یا روزی کار مناسب ، یا روزی زندگی مناسب یا روزی حق
بدن این دروغی است که باعث می شود تا حد کافی در جای خود قرار بگیرد. وقتی به خالی و بی معنی رسیدید
شما می دانید که دیگر هیچ مشکلی وجود ندارد. همه چیز وجود دارد ، امکان وجود دارد. آزادی صراحت اما تو
زندگی شما چیزی نیست جز این که کافی است. و
منبع کافی دروغ است. فقط یکی وجود دارد
منبع کافی است. منشأ کار کافی است
دروغ دروغ گفتن را متوقف کنید و از بین خواهید برد. و
دروغ اساسی این است که همه به معنای چیزی است ،
که این کار را انجام می دهد ، شما می روید
برای اینکه روزی آن را بسازید ، می خواهید دریافت کنید
در آنجا ، آن روزی شاهزاده پری می رود
برای همراهی ، یا شاهزاده خانم پری می رود
برای همراهی ، یا روزی کار مناسب ، یا
روزی زندگی مناسب ، یا روزی حق
بدن این دروغی است که باعث حفظ آن می شود
در جای خود "
روز چهارم: جلسه یک
351
نمی توانید به صورت خالی و بی معنی در سفارش برسید. و هر بار که آن را به یک سفارش تبدیل می کنید ،
شما از دست می دهید که خالی و بی معنی است ، زیرا حقیقت از آن مکیده شده است ، و تبدیل می شود
Platitude دنیس
من فقط می خواهم با این فکر که زندگی خالی است و
بی معنی است و این امکان را باز می کند. درز
من نمی خواهم که شما با "این امکان را باز می کند." که آن را خراب می کند. دنیس
آیا این یک سفارش است؟ درز
بله ببینید ، شما یک مرد واقعی هستید. این بد نیست این توهین نیست این بسیار ارزشمند است
در این فرهنگ ما ارزش زیادی را در این فرهنگ به صورت مرتب قرار می دهیم. دنیس
ممنون درز
بله خیلی خوب ممنون (تشویق)
(روی آوردن به یک شرکت کننده دیگر)
داستان شما چیست؟ جویس
داستان من این است که من آن را دریافت می کنم و آن را رد می کنم. درز
خوب این کار را نکنید از چه چیزی گریه می کنی؟ آیا می دانید؟ بله ، می دانید ، شما چه هستید
گریه در مورد؟ جویس
از آنجا که من برای ایجاد تغییر در زندگی ام آمده ام و نمی بینم که این اتفاق بیفتد. درز
بله من می فهمم بنابراین ، شما می خواستید در زندگی خود تغییری ایجاد کنید زیرا کمی کافی است
در آنجا ، بله؟ بله راه تداوم این مسئله تلاش برای تغییر زندگی شما است. شما متوقف می شوید
با تغییر زندگی ، Exhing Eruing از بین می رود. آیا این واضح است؟ 352
وجود
جویس
بله واضح است درز
بنابراین ، دیگر این کار را نکنید. آن را قطع کنید از رد آن دست بردارید. تلاش برای بهتر شدن را متوقف کنید. دست از تلاش برای
زندگی خود را تغییر دهید. شما چه چیزی را از زندگی می خواهید ، این بسیار مهم است که شما می خواهید
زندگی خود را تغییر دهید؟ چه چیزی شما را آزار می دهد زیرا از دست رفته است؟ جویس
من می خواهم خودم را دوست داشته باشم. من خودم را دوست ندارم درز
خوب اکنون شروع به دوست داشتن خود نکنید. همین حالا این کار را انجام دهید الان خودتان را دوست ندارید. (جویس می خندد)
از چه چیزی لبخند می زنید؟ فکر کردم گفتی خودتان را دوست ندارید. (خنده)
خودتان را دوست ندارید. این خیلی خوب است اکنون خودتان را حتی بیشتر دوست ندارید. شما
توجه کنید همه چیز تغییر کرده است. حالا مثل خودت مثل خودت جویس
این تفاوت ندارد درز
این فرق لعنتی نیست؟ (خنده)
دوست داشتن خود و دوست نداشتن خود ، یک چیز است: این همه مزخرفات است. (بلند کردن صدای او به یک زمین)
این خیال خدادادی در مورد دوست داشتن خود چیست؟ این در فاک چیست؟ این دیوانه است! این مانند راه رفتن در اطراف است که می گوید: "نگاه نکن! نگاه نکن! خدای من یک مرد در آنجا است
به دنبال من با چاقو که خون به پایین می رود. " افراد زورگویی ساخته شده: دوست داشتن شما-
خود/خود را دوست نداشته باشید. شما می دانید که خود را دوست ندارید؟ این مکالمه ای است که شما با آن دارید
خودت افراد گلوله ای ساخته شده اند ، این "دوست داشتن خود را دوست ندارد/خودتان را دوست ندارید." شما می دانید چه
دوست ندارید خود را دوست ندارید؟ این مکالمه ای است که با خودتان دارید. جویس
این مکالمه ای است که من دائماً با خودم دارم. درز
بله ، اما آن را متوقف کنید. این دیوانگی است. چه چیزی مهم است که خود را دوست داشته باشید یا دوست نداشته باشید
خودت؟ آیا مو روی سر شما تغییر می کند؟ روز چهارم: جلسه یک
353
جویس
این چیزی را در خارج تغییر نمی دهد. درز
این چیزی را تغییر نمی دهد. این چیز کوچکی را تغییر نمی دهد. این مطلقاً هیچ چیز تغییر نمی کند. این است
یک گفتگوی مزخرف. مثل این است که در مورد "کدام راه باقی مانده است؟"
(به جویس)
کدام راه باقی مانده است؟ (او به سمت چپ خود اشاره می کند)
نه ، درست است جویس
نه ، درست نیست درز
خیلی درست است! جویس
به تو درز
اما آیا می بینید که این گفتگو بین شما و من چقدر مزخرف است؟ جویس
بله درز
دوست داشتن خود و دوست نداشتن خود به همان اندازه مزخرف است. شما به برخی از گلوله ها متصل شد
مکالمه جویس
بله درز
آیا تا به حال مردم را در مورد مواد مخدر صحبت کرده اید؟ آنها دوست دارند ، Nutty. مثل خودم/مثل خودم نیست
همان تله "اوه. شا؟ برو مرد! جک لعنتی!" این همه گه چیست؟ (خنده)
این همه درام ، درام است. شما تا به حال به فیلم ها رفته اید؟ 354
وجود
جویس
بله درز
مردم آنجا عمل می کنند. این برای واقعی نیست این عمل شماست ، خود را دوست ندارید. این عمل شماست جویس
من آن را دریافت می کنم من می دانم که من یک عمل را انجام داده ام. درز
چیزی نیست که دوست داشته باشد یا دوست نداشته باشد. این به چه معنی است: دوست دارید یا دوست ندارید؟ تو راهی هستی
هستند این کل داستان است ، اینطور نیست؟ جویس
بله درز
و شما همیشه به شکلی که هستید خواهید بود. و شما به همان شکلی خواهید بود که وقتی هستید
شما همانطور که هستید هستید. امروز شما همانطور که امروز هستید هستید. فردا شما مثل راه خواهید بود
شما فردا خواهید بود و روز بعد از آن شما مثل روز بعد خواهید بود. و این
برای بقیه عمر شما صادق خواهد بود. این گفتگو چگونه است یا خود را دوست ندارید؟ این به چه معنی است؟ این مکالمه ای است که من دوست دارم ، من دوست ندارم. و شما باید باشید
قادر به دیدن جنون آن است. واقعاً مجنون است این به خاطر خدا چیست؟ نکته چیست؟ نکته درام است ، مانند اپرا صابون. می دانید ، شما از زندگی برای ایجاد صابون استفاده می کنید
اپرا: این منزجر کننده است. زندگی خالی و بی معنی است. دقیقاً همینطور است جویس
من آن را می بینم آیا من خودم را دوست دارم یا نه ، هیچ مشکلی ایجاد نمی کند. اما من گیر کرده ام من می خواهم
مثل خودم درز
اما نه بگذارید از شما چیزی بپرسم. همه شما را گوش دهید! چه اتفاقی می افتد وقتی مسئله را مطرح می کنید
خودت را دوست داری؟ با مسئله دوست داشتن خود چه چیزی باید پیش برود؟ باید چه چیزی است که باید باشد
برای اینکه خودتان را دوست داشته باشید وجود دارد؟ فقط یک چیز وجود دارد که باید در آنجا باشد
مسئله دوست داشتن خود را داشته باشید. جویس
چه چیزی باید با آن پیش برود؟ درز
بله چه چیزی است که باید در آنجا باشد تا شما خود را دوست داشته باشید؟ فقط یک چیز وجود دارد
این باید آنجا باشد روز چهارم: جلسه یک
355
جویس
خودتان را دوست ندارید؟ درز
بله بدیهی است ، ها؟ شما نمی توانید خود را دوست داشته باشید بدون اینکه خودتان را دوست نداشته باشید. از هر دو خلاص شوید
از آنها این یک مکالمه گلوله است. هیچ چیز در آنجا نیست این درام خالص است جویس
این با خودتان بحث می کند. درز
اگر آبی یا سبز هستید ، بحث می کنید. آیا شما آبی هستید یا سبز؟ جویس
من نه درز
کاملا دوست دارید ، دوست دارید یا غیرممکن هستید؟ مثل این است که از شما بپرسید که آیا آبی یا سبز هستید. این همان نوع سوال است آیا شما آبی هستید یا سبز؟ مزخرف است این زباله است ، و اگر شما
سوالات زباله ای را که می توانید پاسخ زباله دریافت کنید ، بپرسید. هر وقت کسی خود را دوست دارد ، چه می شود
تقویت شده؟ جویس
من نمی دانم درز
خودشان را دوست ندارند. نمی بینید که نمی توانید دوست داشته باشید و فقط کمی دوست داشته باشید
کمی از خود را دوست ندارید؟ آنها دقیقاً یکنواخت بودند ، زیرا شما نمی توانید خودتان را دوست داشته باشید
به جز برخلاف اینکه خود را دوست نداشته باشید. جویس
شما می گویید که هر دو را دور بیندازید. درز
بله این یک سوال زباله است که خود را دوست دارد/خودتان را دوست ندارید. آن را قطع کنید نگه داشتن برخی
دست بدن ؛ به آسمان نگاه کن برو چیزی اتفاق بیفتد: اما وقت خود را با
سوال از دوست داشتن خود یا دوست نداشتن خود را. این راکت شماست جویس (گریه)
یکی از راکت های من ... 356
وجود
درز
سمت راست: و یک راکت قابل توجه برای شما. آنچه شما باید به آن برسید این است که خالی و معنی است-
کمتر در زیر راکت شما همه خالی و بی معنی است. اگر من خود را دوست داشته باشم و
خودتان را دوست ندارید ، با چه چیزی مانده اید؟ هیچی جایی است که ما می خواهیم شما را ترک کنیم: با
هیچی آیا این واضح تر است؟ جویس
بله ، اما من نمی خواهم با هیچ چیز باقی بمانم. درز
من می دانم ، زیرا بازپرداخت در دوست داشتن خود وجود ندارد. شما چیزی از آن خارج می شوید. شما
یک راکتر شما برای بازپرداخت در آن هستید. جویس
بله ، من هستم درز
بله شما بازپرداخت را دوست دارید ، میهمان من باشید. جویس
نه من آن را دوست ندارم. درز
سپس آن را برش دهید. و اگر نمی توانید آن را قطع کنید ، جایی که باید به آن رسیدید این است که زیر آن
راکت خالی و بی معنی است. باید ببینید که راکت شما یک شوخی است. شما نمی خواهید
همیشه از راکت خود خلاص شوید. شما از شر یک خلاص می شوید ، یکی دیگر از آنها را تحت آن قرار می دهید. بی پایان است من به شما گفتم. مثل لایه برداری پیاز است. شما یک راکت را بردارید ، شما
راکت دیگری بگیرید. شما راکت دیگری را می گیرید ، راکت دیگری می گیرید. شما می دانید چه چیزی در
مرکز پیاز؟ هیچی وقتی آخرین لایه را خاموش می کنید ، چه چیزی باقی مانده است؟ هیچی با عرض پوزش برای
استعاره ارزان زندگی خالی و بی معنی است و به معنای هر چیزی نیست که زندگی خالی باشد
و بی معنی آیا آن را دریافت کردید؟ من نگفتم "احساس خوبی کردی؟" گفتم "آیا آن را گرفتی؟"
جویس
زندگی خالی و بی معنی است که زندگی خالی و بی معنی است به معنای هیچ چیز نیست. درز
نه. این زندگی خالی و بی معنی است و این به معنای چیزی نیست. معنایی ندار
به آن ببینید ، شما سعی می کنید این چیزی را ایجاد کنید. مانند ، "خوب ، پس من مجبور نیستم
زحمت! " شماره این به معنای چیزی نیست ؛ شما نمی توانید از آن معنا پیدا کنید ، در غیر این صورت نابود می شوید
آن و به محض اینکه این کار را می کنید به معنای چیزی است که شما حقیقت را از آن خارج می کنید. شما می گیرید
ارزش حقیقت از آن است. سپس آن را به یک قضیه احمقانه تبدیل می کند که مردم را با آنها آزار می دهید. "آیا شما نمی دانید که زندگی خالی و بی معنی است؟" مردم نمی خواهند آن گه را بشنوند. روز چهارم: جلسه یک
357
(خنده)
به اطراف نگویید که زندگی مردم خالی و بی معنی است. زندگی خود را از آن زندگی کنید. نگو
مردم که بنابراین آنچه برای بدست آوردن این است که زندگی خالی و بی معنی است و اینطور نیست
معنایی دارند یعنی: این واقعیت که زندگی خالی و بی معنی است خالی است و
بی معنی این فقط خالی و بی معنی است. جویس
من آن را دریافت می کنم درز
خوب ، این همه چیز برای لحظه ای است. من نگفتم که شما باید احساس خوبی داشته باشید. Erhard به کار خود ادامه داد که یکی یکی با افرادی که ایستاده بودند به دلیل این که آنها این کار را نکردند
زندگی خالی و بی معنی است. erhard (به یک شرکت کننده دیگر)
مشکل شما چیست؟ سالی
من با زندگی خالی و بی معنی بودن زندگی سختی دارم که زندگی خالی است و
بی معنی درز
بگذارید این کار را برای شما آسان کنم. زندگی خالی و بی معنی است: آیا آن قسمت را گرفتید؟ سالی
بله درز
این به چه معنی است؟ کنسرو مهم آن بیانیه چیست؟ سالی
که خالی و بی معنی است ، اما من در اینجا نشسته ام و فکر می کنم ، "لعنت کنید! چه کسی اهمیت می دهد؟"
درز
نه ، شما فقط به معنای چیزی ساخته اید. شما آن را دریافت نکردید زیرا شما آن را به معنای چیزی ساخته اید. شما گفتید ، "خوب اگر خالی و بی معنی است ..." ببینید ، هنگامی که گفتید "پس" ، شما دریافت نکردید
آن شما آن را خراب کردید آیا این چیزی است که من فقط گفتم؟ سالی
بله ، پس به چیزی تبدیل می شود. پس به معنای چیزی است.
