SPEAKING BEING
KENNETH
I shared about losing my job, about poor Kenneth, about why I feel there’s a poor Kenneth 
there. I got relatively clear on that during the training why I have a poor Kenneth thing, what 
that’s doing to my life. I didn’t get to the tears that I’ve been experiencing here. That’s new. 
I didn’t have that in the training. I feel like my life the past two years has been going upside 
down and it’s scaring the shit out of me.
KIPP
No, what happened is, you got laid off , and your marriage is...
KENNETH
My marriage is about to terminate.
KIPP
It’s about to terminate. You sound like it’s a computer turning off . 
(laughter)
KENNETH
Really. Okay.
KIPP
And something about your house.
KENNETH
Right.
KIPP
Anything else?
KENNETH
I have a new relationship.
KIPP
Are you always this excited about that or is this a breakthrough?
(laughter)
KENNETH
That’s great, yeah. Pardon my schtick.
