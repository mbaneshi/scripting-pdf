SPEAKING BEING
not the reasons, nobody else and nothing else. And you have reasons. That’s what I mean by
people don’t know their ass from a hole in the ground. People don’t know what put them in that
chair. If you’re stuck with this idea that you were pressured, I want you out of here. I’m going
to say a lot of things in here and you’re only going to get them almost. I know that today you’re
going to get almost nothing I say, because you’re going to put it in the language in which you
dwell. Like “should.” I don’t dwell in the language of should. It’s patently obvious here. I’m
asking you who’s buried in Grant’s Tomb. This is not hard. You put yourself here.
A participant raised a question about a friend he wanted to do The Forum. He described the man.
PARTICIPANT
Would he feel pressured?
ERHARD
Yeah, because he’s an asshole.
PARTICIPANT (laughs)
Yeah, that’s true.
ERHARD
You see, you can’t pressure people who are straight. They give clear answers, like “no,” or
“don’t call me.” I invite people. I want to be clear what I mean by an invitation. An invitation
for me always carries with it the power to decline.
Erhard mounted the platform, and announced a break. However, he said, “in The Forum there are
no breaks,” so he gave the participants an assignment.
ERHARD
The assignment during the break is to sort out your “story” from “what happened.” Most people
live in the story and don’t live in the what happened. And there’s something disempowering
about living in the story instead of living in the what happened. The problem is that you are
thrown—that’s like already always—you are thrown to the story. You are addicted to the story.
“People don’t like me” and “being insulted” never happen. I’m going to demonstrate insulting.
I’m going to insult you: I insult you. For the fi rst time in your life you’ve now been insulted as a
what happened. All the other times, someone said something, and you got insulted. People have
t
said you’re a jerk. But that’s somebody saying “You’re a jerk.” The insult was a story.
t
Having given the assignment, Erhard called Julie, The Forum Supervisor, to the podium.
ERHARD
Julie’s the person who keeps this organized enough so that it can happen. So your cooperation
with her is in your interest.
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day One: Session One
31
After Erhard left the room, Julie requested that due to the size of the group all participants should
be respectful of the hotel. She pointed out the assistants who could direct participants to pay phones
and bathrooms. “We request that you don’t eat on this break,” she said. “If you must eat for medical
reasons, please see Wes,” one of the two Forum leaders who were assisting Erhard. Finally she in-
troduced the other four Forum supervisors who were working with her, and who were available to
answer their questions. Finally, as she would before every break, she read the names of participants
who had received telephone messages during the session.
The Forum adjourned for a break at 12:40 pm.

SPEAKING BEING
Hints: Ontological Distinctions
The Forum achieves its result through the development in dialogue of what Werner
Erhard calls distinctions. In traditional education, based in an epistemological model
in which the goal is to increase or enhance what is known, information—concepts,
ideas, processes—are communicated through definition and explanation. The Fo-
rum, however, develops an ontological model of education, in which the goal is not
an increase in knowledge but an experience of Being. In this model, the elements of
the course content are distinguished.
The nature of distinctions will be addressed at length by Erhard later in The
Forum. But here, early on the first morning, the development of distinctions is al-
ready under way. Erhard is beginning to employ an aspect of his methodology that,
according to Martin Heidegger, is central to ontological communication: the use of
hints to communicate what cannot directly be spoken, thereby providing access to
the content as lived rather than as merely understood.
Heidegger introduced the idea of hinting as a way of communicating Being in
his 1959 essay, “A Dialogue on Language” (in OWL), which provides an account of
his conversation with a Japanese scholar who shared his interest in ontological
inquiry. The interaction, presented in the form of a transcript, occurs as a stately
conversational dance, a linguistic minuet. Each move is made with great care, so the
interaction proceeds at times with excruciating deliberateness. At one point Heide-
gger (referred to in the account as the Inquirer) poses a question—“Do you have in
your language a word for what we call language?”—to which the scholar arrives at
a tentative answer only after twenty-three pages of thoughtful circumnavigation in
and around the topic.
In response to a remark by the Japanese about language’s “essential being,”
Heidegger refers to his often-quoted characterization of language as “the house of
Being.” The phrase, he says, “gives a hint of the nature of language” (“DL” in OWL
26). As the two men’s dialogue continues, the extraordinary attentiveness given
to each word reveals a respect for the nature of hints. Hints, Heidegger observes,
“belong to an entirely different realm of reality. . . . They are enigmatic. They beckon
to us. They beckon away. They beckon us toward that from which they unexpectedly
bear themselves toward us” (“DL” in OWL 26).
In his conversation with the Japanese scholar, Heidegger is distinguishing
hinting, which is to say that he is hinting at the nature of hints. The Forum’s develop-
ment of distinctions is likewise a process of hinting.
SESSION ONE INTERVAL
In hinting, words are spoken in such a way that “each word in each case is
given its full—most often hidden—weight” (“DL” in OWL 31). What is not spoken, but
communicated in the background, is allowed to reverberate. In this way a space is
allowed to develop around each utterance:
[Inquirer]: Hints need the widest sphere in which to swing. . .
[Japanese]: . . . where mortals go to and fro only slowly.
[Inquirer]: This is what our language calls “hesitate.” It is done
truly when slowness rests on shy reverence. And so I do not wish to
disturb your hesitation by urging you on too rashly.
[Japanese]: You are more helpful to me in my attempt to say the
word than you can know. (“DL” in OWL 27–28)
Further, although each distinction has a rubric for its topic—in this dialogue, the
topic is the nature of language—in developing distinctions the aim is not to arrive at
a correct verbal articulation of the rubric. On the contrary, the goal is to avoid such a
resolution:
[Japanese]: We Japanese do not think it strange if a dialogue
leaves undefined what is really intended, or even restores it
back to the keeping of the undefinable.
[Inquirer]: That is part, I believe, of every dialogue that
has turned out well between thinking beings. As if of its own
accord, it can take care that that undefinable something not
only does not slip away, but displays its gathering force ever
more luminously in the course of the dialogue. (“DL” in OWL 13)
In this conversation, Heidegger and the Japanese scholar may be seen as
enacting the methodology of The Forum: the dialogic development of distinctions
through a process of hinting. Being cannot be verbalized. Being is in language, but
it is not in the words that are spoken. It lives in the unspoken background, and in
a conversation for Being, that background must be made present. Hints are an
appropriate form for bringing a background to presence because they direct our
attention toward something we had not noticed, something which they at the same
time bring forward to meet us.
Ontological hinting is not an easy form of communication to master, and by
characterizing it here as an element of The Forum’s “methodology,” we have fallen
prey to one of its pitfalls. When Heidegger says to the Japanese scholar that calling
“
“

language “the house of Being” gives a “hint of the nature of language,” the scholar
immediately recognizes the danger: “I fear that to call your ‘house of Being’ a hint
might tempt you and me to elaborate the notion of hinting into a guiding concept in
which we then bundle up everything” (“DL” in OWL).  Heidegger concurs, but adds
that this error can “never be prevented in the sense of being totally excluded,” since
“the mode of conceptual representation insinuates itself all too easily into every
kind of human experience” (“DL” in OWL 25).
A relevant observation by the senior author: during my years of participation in
Erhard’s work, the distinguishing of distinctions has remained a source of fascina-
tion, challenge, and even mystery for me. I have observed conversations between
Forum leaders—people for whom the development of distinctions is central to their
professional practice—in which the speaking occurred to me as a kind of short-
hand. Elements of everyday interaction—details,  transitions, connections—seemed
to be missing. On one occasion, a statement by one Forum leader elicited this re-
sponse from another: “You’re explaining it. Distinguish it.” I found myself struggling
to recognize the difference being referred to.
An extensive hint at the nature of distinctions is found in Heidegger’s later work,
where he turned his attention increasingly to the ontological possibilities of art, and
specifically of poetry. Poetry, he said, is projective saying—that is, a kind of saying
which projects a clearing for Being by speaking the unspoken. “Projective saying
is saying which, in preparing the sayable, simultaneously brings the unsayable as
such into a world” (“OWA” in PLT 71). But such saying is not limited to the speaking
of the poet, because “Language itself is poetry in the essential sense” (“OWA” in PLT
72). Indeed, “everyday language is a forgotten and used-up poem, from which there
hardly resounds a call any longer” (“L” in PLT 205).
The thinker, says Heidegger elsewhere, confines his thinking to a single
thought (PLT 4). Heidegger’s single thought was the question of Being. A similar
single-mindedness characterizes the poet, and so Heidegger’s description of the
poet’s relation to the unsayable is useful:
Every great poet creates his poetry out of one single
poetic statement only. . . . The poet’s statement remains
unspoken. None of his individual poems, nor their totality,
says it all. Nonetheless, every poem speaks from the whole
of the one single statement, and in each instance says that
statement. (“LP” in OWL 160)
“
Therefore all of Heidegger’s writing and all of Werner Erhard’s work, as well as all the
poetry of Dickinson or Rilke or Wallace Stevens, may be seen as bodies of hints for
the Saying of what is essentially unsayable.
34
SPEAKING BEING
During the forty-minute break, statements had been written on two of the chalkboards. On one:
“Promise of The Forum: You can have anything out of The Forum that you are willing to stand for
having gotten.” On the second: “The commitment of the work is Transformation: bringing forth a
breakthrough in the possibility of being for human beings.”
As The Forum resumed, Erhard began with a question.
ERHARD
What happened when you were considering the diff erence between your story and what hap-
pened?
PARTICIPANT
I found that I didn’t want to confront my stories.
ERHARD
It’s possible to live in a kind of unconsciousness that we don’t ordinarily call unconsciousness
because we’re not knocked out. It’s an unconsciousness which appears as not being there. What
you can’t be with prevents you from being. If you mash up the what happens and the story, it
kind of keeps you a little unconscious, because you don’t have to be with it. But when you start
to distinguish the story from what happened, you begin to see the story as a story, and it’s not
very attractive that way, is it? And it’s something one would mostly avoid being with. There
will be a lot that will come up in here that you don’t want to be with. It’s useful to be with what
you don’t want to be with. What you’ve already learned to be with and survive with--that’s not
going to be very useful in here, it’s the part you’ve avoided being with here. Anything else?
Thanks very much.
As participants responded to this question, Erhard contextualized their contributions by expanding
the distinctions he had introduced earlier in the day.
JOHN
I’ve never really liked my wife’s version of the story of how we got married.
ERHARD
When you can recognize a person’s story as their story, you begin to have access to their version
of the story, so that you’re not stuck with, you don’t have to resign yourself to, their version of
the story. You have access to diff erent possibilities within the story, but not when it’s mashed up
with what happened.
JOHN
I got so upset, I left the room, and while I heard the story from another part of the house, my
upset turned toward wanting to get out of my marriage.
ERHARD  (interrupting)
You didn’t invent thinking about getting out of your marriage. That’s already always in the cul-
ture of being for human beings. You think, “oh well, this happened and that made me think I

Forum Day One: Session Two

Philosophy as Rhetorical Evocation
We propose that The Forum is an instance of ontological
rhetoric. We emphasize at the outset that this is not the everyday
understanding of rhetoric as “mere rhetoric,” that is, language that
is superficial and disconnected from serious purposes. Rhetoric as
we use the term is any use of language that is intended to produce
a real-world result. Ontological rhetoric communicates in the
unspoken realm of language to provide its listeners with access to
the realm of Being.
Recognition of the value and function of ontological
rhetoric is found in the later writing of Henry W. Johnstone,
Jr., founder of the journal, Philosophy and Rhetoric. Early in his
career, Johnstone believed that the role of the philosophical
rhetor was “to treat his audience as an object,” and that his goal
should quit or leave.” That’s not the way it works. It’s a rainstorm. Leaving, getting out of things,
quitting—owns your life. It’s true you have the conversation with yourself personally. But that’s
like getting wet in a rainstorm.
(with emphasis)
I’m not thinking that. That is thinking me.
(pausing)
I’m starting to talk like people don’t talk, because I want access to what concerns me that
people don’t have. So you and I are starting to invent a language that gives us access to the
things that are interesting, or important, that concern us in life. It’s not your thought. I want
you to start to think that it thinks you. You have the thoughts like you get wet in the rain-
storm. I’m just asking you to begin to think in a way you haven’t thought before. The kind of
person you are is given by that thinking, which isn’t your thoughts or your thinking.
JOHN
What I noticed was that each of us have diff erent stories about how we got together.
ERHARD
You can’t ask questions like “True?” about people’s stories. There’s no such thing as “true
”
stories.” “True” and “story” don’t go together. A story’s a story. People get into trouble in life
because they start believing their stories. Even worse, you start believing someone else’s story—
makes you a spear-carrier in somebody else’s opera. This is not a good way to live.
JOHN
We did what we did and got married.
ERHARD
Who is not clear about choosing to be married? The conversation about why you’re in The
Forum could apply as well to you in your job, or your marriage. Almost nobody thinks they
are anyplace because they put themselves there. But everybody puts themselves there. Then
you get the story about why you’re there. There’s no power in the story... You live in a story
about being married. I accuse you that you live in a story about being married, and the
quality of being married reflects that it in part is generated by a story. I didn’t say you don’t
have a good marriage. But it’s limited to a certain box, a certain space or quality, when it’s a
story. What happened? You got married. Then there’s this whole story. And they’re distinct
from one another. The same thing is true about everything in life. See, you and I have the
kind of lives that people would have if they lived out of a story. And mostly the story is
constituted mostly by your reasons. But you got that job. That’s what happened.
JOHN
Normally I know that, but I wasn’t clear about that last night. It’s so easy to forget.

SPEAKING BEING
was “to manipulate his audience so as to secure agreement”
(“Persuasion” 19). But a “turn” in Johnstone’s thinking led him
to acknowledge by 1978 that “the distinction between finding
the truth in philosophy and finding the proper rhetorical devices
for propagating it cannot be maintained” (“Truth” 74). In other
words, “truth” is always and already rhetorical, never severed
from its communication, and thus finding the “truth” requires
holding up a pretense that rhetoric is merely a convenient
accessory that can be dispensed with.
Johnstone’s new perspective of the philosophy–rhetoric
relationship was based in the concept of evocation: “My present
view is that a successful argument in philosophy is one that is
intended to evoke, and does evoke, a response of a certain kind
in the man to whom it is addressed” (“Truth” 75). Johnstone cited
Heidegger as evidence for this view, and his description here of
Heidegger’s language use is consistent with our understanding of
both Heidegger’s and Erhard’s thinking:
ERHARD
That’s why we don’t give you anything to remember. You just have to be.
HANNAH
There’s a new babysitter watching the baby while I’m here and I got a note at the break to call
and I immediately felt terror because six months ago there was an accident that threatened his
life.
ERHARD
You understand that the terror is of no value to her? You sympathize with the terror. When you
leave here you’ll be a little more ruthless than you are now. You’ll be concerned for what em-
powers people, not for sympathizing with their weaknesses. No empowerment in terror.
HANNAH
I had lost closeness with him. It was more about clinging, and I saw that it was more about
terror.
ERHARD
Major issues like parenting or confronting death generate the most persistent stories. The things
that are real close to us are hard not to be stupid about. It’s hard to be with that people do die.
And you are going to die. And that’s hard to be with. The more dramatic the soap opera is the
easier it is to get drawn into it and not be able to distinguish the story from what happened.
MAX
I’m here because I want my life to stop being an emergency, in my personal and professional
life. I am an upset waiting to happen.
ERHARD
Some of you are an argument waiting to happen. You’re waiting for the occasion to act out the
argument.
MAX
Turning away from my story to what happened is like becoming an arbitrator. It helps me get
away from my guilt.
ERHARD
If guilt were useful, I would say have a lot of it. Listen up here! This is another one of those
things you want to get. Feeling guilty makes it all right that you did something. If you didn’t feel
guilty you’d be a bad person. That’s not terrible to be a bad person. No, it’s all right to do some-
thing as long as you feel guilty about it. Guilt is the salve we put on something that we did so
that we don’t have to be responsible for it. But you don’t know what I’m talking about because
you don’t know the diff erence between guilt and responsibility at this point. Max?
If I am correct in arguing that Heidegger
conceives philosophy as basically rhetorical,
some revision in our conception of rhetoric
is called for. . . its purpose is not to incite its
hearer to action—even the action of adopting
some specific belief. Instead, rhetoric totally
reorients the hearer; if he listens to it he is in
a position to abandon an inauthentic life in
favor of an authentic one. (“Rhetoric” 68)
“
On this view, the truth of philosophy is intimately infused with
its communicability: “discovery, communication, and rhetoric all
collapse into a unitary philosophical act” (“Truth” 76). Further,
communicability is manifested as evocation: “The only way to tell
whether what I have is a truth or a falsehood,” said Johnstone, “is
to contemplate its evocative power.” And rhetoric, he added, is “the
art of evocation” (“Truth” 76).
Finally, Johnstone’s discussion of Heidegger raises a third issue
which will be particularly relevant in our analysis of The Forum: that
is the question of the appropriate rhetorical style for addressing an

MAX
The story is that I joined the service, and went to Vietnam. And my welcome home isn’t what
I expected. What happened was, I went to war and came back alive. Same as any other war,
there’s...it’s cleared up a lot of issues to look at it as what happened rather than my story in
relation to my coming home.
ERHARD (with emphasis)
Listen up! Vietnam’s a great, great story. Lot of people badly, badly fucked up by the story. Notice
I didn’t say by what happened? Lots of people profoundly disabled by the story. Lot of freedom
for people to start to distinguish the story from what happened. Thanks Max.
Erhard shifted his tone, calling attention to the process they had been engaged in: they had devel-
oped a number of distinctions as tools for their inquiry.
ERHARD
We’re going to get these tools sharpened up as we proceed. Your questions are useful. You notice
I’ve done most of what I’ve done out of people’s speaking. This is not a lecture, that’s why we
call it The Forum. This is a dialogue. My job is to manage the dialogue, not to lecture. I have
no pipeline to the truth. No one is asking you to believe anything that is said in here. But I’m
asking you to think about it. That’s diff erent from “reject” or “accept” it. Instead, see what the
world looks like standing in that idea. It doesn’t matter whether you agree or not. To tell the
truth, I’m not that impressed with you yet, to care whether you agree or not. I do want to hear
what you have to say. I’m not interested in your agreement or approval, or endorsement. I am
interested in you looking at what we’re saying here, to think about it yourself. And the way I’d
like you to do that is to not judge it or evaluate it to see if it fi ts with what you already think. If
I say anything that fi ts with what you already think, you shouldn’t be here. You can forget all
that. Anything I say that fi ts with what you already think: that’s not The Forum. Only what I
say that doesn’t fi t with the stuff  you think, that provokes you to think and see things in a new
way: that’s what’s valuable. But this isn’t the truth either. I don’t know about the truth. I know
how to talk so that people have new possibility in their life. If you talk with me, you can bet that
you’ll walk away with a new possibility in your life.
Now he introduced a new way to address what has already been the subject of the discussion.
ERHARD (continuing)
We’re going to talk about existence. That’s what we’ve been talking about. It’s hard to talk about.
It’s hard to pick yourself up by your own bootstraps. It’s got to exist to talk about it. If you’re go-
ing to question existence—talk about existence—it’s got to exist to talk about it. The word for a
concern for existence is ontology. And the reason I bring up that fancy sounding word is I want
you to know The Forum is not psychological. Most people can’t tell the diff erence. Psychology
is pervasive in our culture. The structure for interpretation for most people in this culture is psy-
chological. We’re all amateur psychologists. You see everything through a psychological lens.
untransformed audience whom one intends, through one’s rhetorical
transactions, to transform. Johnstone stated the problem this way:
Heidegger’s entire position is specifically
committed to the task of awakening phi-
listines from their ontological slumber
. . . . Das Man [the “they,” the philistine, the
untransformed] expects to be told in plain En-
glish what he can in fact come to understand
only by being awakened. But because Heide-
gger’s entire thrust is toward the awakening
of das Man he cannot reject as a mere philis-
tine the man who fails to understand him. In
Heidegger’s own terms, he is not successful
until he has reached the philistine. Hence in
a sense there are no philistines at all for him.
(“Rhetoric” 68)
“
How does one awaken people from a debilitating slumber if
they resist the process which is necessary for their awakening?
This question, as we will show, is a central one for the rhetorical
process of The Forum. ■
“
Only what I say that doesn’t fit with stuff
you think, that provokes you to think and
see things in a new way: that’s what’s
valuable.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (pausing to wake a participant who was nodding off )
It’s okay to sleep in here if you can do it bolt upright with your eyes open.
(returning to his topic)
Ontology is the diff erence between knowing how to play tennis and being a tennis player. They
don’t teach this in school for the most part, and when they do, they do it badly for the most part.
An ontological approach—that is to say, a concern-for-being approach—has got a lot of room in
it because it’s something we haven’t engaged in very much. The point is, there’s a lot of room
in a new realm. The psychological approach is one we’ve pushed really hard. And I want to be
clear I’m not denigrating it. And that’s not our approach.
(moving to one of the blackboards)
So far, we’ve distinguished two realms of existence. A phenomenon can exist in the realm of
story and it can exist in the realm of what happened.
Erhard drew two circles on the board: in the left circle he wrote the word  “Story,” and in the right he
wrote “What Happened.”
ERHARD (indicating the left circle)
Max gave us a good example. There’s the story of Vietnam and that’s here. And there’s what
happened, and that’s here.
(indicating the right circle in which he wrote “what happened”)
We’re going to see what happens when you begin to distinguish these two. You’re going to see
the impact it has on your ability and state of being to distinguish Vietnam “the story” and Viet-
nam “the what happened.” You can apply the demonstration anywhere. We need to talk about
thinking. Listen up. This is hard. Human beings have the notion that they think. Or—I might
as well introduce this—they are that they think. They be like they’re thinking. And there is
something happening. You and I call that “I think.” Here’s an exercise to tell if you’re thinking.
I’m going to shut up and you’re going to stop thinking.
(pausing for about fi fteen seconds)
You didn’t make it, did you? Nobody ever does, because it’s not you thinking. If you were
thinking then you could stop thinking. It is thinking, and you are having the thoughts it thinks.
t
Which is true? The old way of saying it or the way I said it? That’s not the point. I told you,
I don’t know the truth. I’m saying there’s something empowering about this, in the recogni-
tion that you don’t think. Like: “Hmm. I’m not thinking. It’s thinking, and I’m having those
thoughts.” What comes up when you think this way is the possibility of actually thinking.
Thinking is a process independent of those thoughts. Thinking is something like sitting with,
or more precisely something like dwelling in. It’s not like fi guring it out. You see, I asked you to
g
dwell in the possibility that it’s not you thinking.
(pausing again to address a number of people in the room who were getting sleepy)
It always happens about now. Thinking about thinking puts you to sleep. Thinking wakes you
g
up. Thinking is when you have to break your mind—though not all of that is thinking. Some of
it is bullshit.
“
It is thinking, and you are having the thoughts
t
it thinks. . . . Thinking is something like
sitting with, or more precisely something like
dwelling in. It’s not like figuring it out.
Forum Day One: Session Two
39
(turning to The Forum Supervisor)
Julie, would you ask Eric to get the Heidegger books out of my room.
(returning to the blackboard, and pointing to the circle labeled “story”)
I want to take back making this bad. What’s disempowering is not the story, what’s disempow-
ering is when you collapse “what happened” with the “story” and you can’t distinguish the story
from what happened. You can’t distinguish because you’ve got this mush, this mess, this swamp
of what happened and the story mixed together. The two need to be distinct. What does distinct
mean? It means existing then on their own, being there of themselves. It’s possible for Vietnam
to exist as a story and it’s possible for Vietnam to exist as a what happened. They’re two distinct
realms of existence. Sometimes the story is appropriate, sometimes what happened is appropri-
ate. What’s never appropriate is when these two distinctions get collapsed.
As this conversation developed, Erhard added other terms to his blackboard model. In the right
circle, below “what happened,” he wrote “presence” and “I’m late.” In the other, below “story,” was
written “concept” and “reasons.”
ERHARD
Confusing what happened with your story about it is like ordering steak and then mixing the
steak with the menu. Most people think life is sour because they’ve been eating the menu for
so long, they don’t recognize reading the menu. You should not say “I love you” to people. You
should say, “I live with the concept ‘I love you.’” Love as a concept is sometimes important, but
t
it isn’t the same as love as a presence. What falls out of my mouth when I say “chair” is a con-
cept. It’s not a chair—but it’s useful. Just separating the two domains of existence in any area of
your life will leave you with more power in that area. For this to work, try it on in your own life.
This is not the truth. Try it on. If it works, good; if not, throw it away.
At this point, The Forum Supervisor brought Erhard a copy of Heidegger’s What is Called Thinking?
(1968, pages 76-77). He spent a minute looking for the passage he wanted, and fi nally turned back
to her.
ERHARD
This is the wrong copy. This is not the copy I can fi nd things in. I have two marked copies and I
can fi nd things in one and not the other.
Julie brought up the correct copy.
ERHARD (beginning to read)
“People still hold the view that what is handed down to us by tradition is what in reality lies
behind us—while in fact it comes toward us because we are its captives and destined to it.”
(pausing)
We think we’re out in front of tradition on the leading edge. He’s talking about where the rub-
ber meets the road. This is not some fancy talk.
