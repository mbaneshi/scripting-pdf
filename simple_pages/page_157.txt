Right.
ERHARD
How much energy did your father put into fi xing you?
MIKE
He kept pointing out all the wrong things I did.

So you dominated your dad by getting him attached to your stupidity, right? Like Brer Rabbit. 
That was his relationship to you, trying to deal with your stupidity. 
MIKE
When he was trying to correct me.
ERHARD
What other payoff s did you get out of being stupid? Did you get to be right? Did your father get

I got to be right about being dumb.
ERHARD

So you made what you identifi ed with right.

Correct.
ERHARD
What did it cost you to have a racket called being stupid?
