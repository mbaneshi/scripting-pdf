there for him, when I was divorced, and all the time from when he was three until he was four-
teen, I don’t think I was there for him, and I just wanted to tell him that. And he got it. He just 
got it. He said, “I’m glad you know that.” And I have a lot of reasons that I could give you for
why I wasn’t there for him. But the fact of the matter is I just wasn’t there for him. I just didn’t 
participate. The list is a mile long.
KIPP
It’s called your life.
ANABETH
Right, all the things I didn’t participate in. So now I have a question. Can I ask you a question?
KIPP
Sure.
ANABETH
The question is: So if you know that you were a six-year-old for all this time, but... and you’ve 
worked with that and stayed with that...

ANABETH

that anymore.”
ANABETH
You have it.
KIPP
It’s still there...
ANABETH
It’s still there.
KIPP
...at all times and under all circumstances, ready to use your life.
ANABETH (continuing)
