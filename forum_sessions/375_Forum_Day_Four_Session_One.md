makes it turn out all right, right? Or it’s going to turn out wrong if you hope it’s going to turn
out so you don’t dare hope. It’s voodoo. That’s nuts. That’s a guy following me with a knife with
blood dripping down from it: “Don’t look! But you can’t see him anyhow, only I can see him.”
(laughter)
Look, what are you hoping for? You’re hoping it’ll all be all right, huh?
SALLY
Yeah.
ERHARD
But it won’t be all right. It’ll be the way it is. It won’t be any diff erent from the way it is. That’s
the way it will be. It’ll be the way that it is. And all you’re doing is making a drama out of it. Is
that clear?
SALLY
Yes.
ERHARD
If you like making dramas out of it go ahead. What you do with your life is none of my busi-
ness. That’s not my business, that’s your business.
SALLY
So there’s no good or bad, there’s just the way it is.
Erhard’s manner is very relaxed and casual at this point, ranging freely in volume from loud to
intimate.
ERHARD
There is good and bad. Go out there and shoot someone; then you’ll fi nd out how bad it is.
SALLY
All right, that’s where I’m stuck then, because...
ERHARD
I know you’re stuck. I know how you were brought up.
(laughter)
Yeah, there is good and bad, but not inherently. Inherently there’s nothing. Was there goodness
in the rainstorm when the fl ood came from the rain that killed people? Don’t you see that that’s
insane? The rainstorm isn’t good or bad it’s a goddamn rainstorm. Where does good and bad
exist? In a conversation. And that conversation has a lot of force to it. You exist in a particular
culture; a particular religious culture, a particular ethnic culture, a particular national cul-
ture, a particular family culture, and that’s where good and bad arose from. It’s a phenomenon
Caputo finds in this aspect of Heidegger’s thought a “serious
difficulty”: “It does not seem to me that many of Heidegger’s
excited and enthusiastic followers, who speak like Heidegger, as
though they have experienced what Heidegger experienced, have
recognized the austerity of Heidegger’s path or acknowledged the
danger which lies along this path” (252–253). The danger of the
path, says Caputo, lies in the powerlessness of human beings who
travel it, and in their inability to find secure ground and comfort
in the mysterious realm of Being, whose apparently arbitrary
nature Heidegger has described here, explicating Fragment 52 of
Heraclitus, as “play”:
The “because” withers away in the play. The
play is without “why.” It plays since it plays.
It simply remains a play: the most elevated
and the most profound. But this “simply”
is everything, the one, the only. Nothing is
without ground/reason. Being and ground/
reason: the same. Being, as what grounds,
has no ground; as the abyss it plays the play
that, as Geschick [destiny], passes [B]eing and
k
ground/reason to us. The question remains
whether and how we, hearing the movements
of this play, play along and accommodate
ourselves to the play. (PR 113)
“
Thus, for Caputo, Heidegger’s thought moves “close to the edge of
despair. For he makes us dependent upon the outcome of a ‘game’
upon which our very essence is staked, a game in which thinking
may lend a hand but in which it has no final say” (251–252).
The diff iculty with Heidegger is not that he is
a mystic, but that he is not. His thought is so
radically worldly and secular and drained of
absolute and divine assurances that it can at
best assist in a world-play; for the kingdom is
in the hands of a child. (252)

SPEAKING BEING
which arises only in language. There is no good or bad outside of language. Now good and bad
is very real stuff . But it’s a phenomenon that only exists in language.
(loudly)
Listen up, goddamn it! You’ve stopped thinking again. You think you’ve got it so you don’t have
to think. The fl oor as an object exists independent of language. That clear? For whom is that
not clear? Put your hand up if that isn’t clear?
(looking around the room)
The existence of the fl oor as an object doesn’t require language. Is that clear?
(pausing)
Good. Is there any such thing as art independent of language? Where there is no language,
is there art? No, because art is a phenomenon that arises only in language. Now you assholes
think I said art’s not real and fl oors are. I didn’t say that. Art is very real. It alters the course of
history, has a profound impact on the culture, changes people’s lives, brings things into peo-
ple’s lives that would not be there were it not for art. It’s very real stuff . It’s real, and it does not
exist independent of language. Art is a phenomenon that only arises in language. Is that clear?
There’s no such thing as beauty independent of language. Beauty is a phenomenon which only
arises in language. There’s no such thing as beauty independent of language. Beauty is real,
and it does not exist independent of language. You need to start thinking and stop believing.
You believe too much. There is no such thing as art or beauty or design, no such thing as
love and happiness. None of the things that are important to you in life exist independent of
language. Birds don’t build homes. Nests are hard-wired into birds. You don’t understand that
then don’t get engaged in the conversation. That part of the conversation. Only agents with lan-
guage, only people build homes. Homes are a phenomenon that only arises, only in language.
So there’s no such thing as beauty or art. Here’s what you want to get out of this. Not beauty or
art: This is not a course on aesthetics. What you want to get out of it is that there are certain
phenomena that arise only in language. Over where your dog is, nothing is bad. You know
where bad is for your dog? Where you are. That’s where bad arises to the dog, because bad is
a phenomenon that only exists in language. Independent of language there is no bad. There is
no bad in an earthquake for the earthquake. There’s only bad for people with language...sorry:
entities with language. And that’s the same thing about good. But it’s very real stuff . It’s not
unreal. Now, language comes out of silence, which is a form of empty and meaningless. Good
and bad come out of nothing. It doesn’t come out of inherent good or bad. It’s not like you can
ignore it. It’s not like it isn’t true. It’s real stuff , and it arises only in language. You can’t report
that something is good. You can’t give a report that something is bad. Good and bad only arise
in language. You can’t talk about something being good: Now you do, don’t you? That’s because
you’re stupid. You talk about things being good and bad. You talk in ignorance that what you’re
talking about when you talk about good and bad is talking. That’s like talking about talking,
you understand? When you talk about good and bad you’re talking about talking.
(to Sally)
You were saying?
Caputo’s point is important, and is central to a consideration
of the path which Heidegger is inviting us to follow. The authors
of this book are certainly among those whom Caputo has
described as “excited and enthusiastic” about the possibilities
of Heidegger’s thinking. However, we do not claim to have
“experienced what Heidegger experienced”: we do feel an affinity
for that realm of experience about which he speaks; that affinity
is due, at least in part, to our participation in the work of Werner
Erhard. Thus, in the face of Caputo’s challenge, we must ask
ourselves whether we have truly confronted the “austerity and
danger” of Heidegger’s path.
This is a question that must be asked persistently—a
question which must be stood within, rather than answered—
since Being must be continually wrested from, and contextualized
by, non-Being. The nihilation of the nothing must be ongoing. But
the original encounter is fraught with agon, that is, with contest:
human resistance to confronting the Nothing is fundamental.
The Nothing’s enormity so violates our everyday identity that we
instinctively close ourselves to the possibility which it contains.
Heidegger states:
We are so finite that we cannot even bring
ourselves originally before the [N]othing
through our own decision and will. So
profoundly does finitude entrench itself in
existence that our most proper and deepest
limitation refuses to yield to our freedom.
(“WM” in BW 106)

“
Therefore, the struggle to provide an authentic confrontation with
the austerity of the Nothing, and to overcome the resistance to its
realization, is a central element of The Forum.
The important questions to be considered in comparing
Heidegger with religious models of transformation, such as
Meister Eckhart, are these: what might be the transformative
power of a leap into the truly unknown rather than into the
arms of a comforting and fatherly God? Might not the “danger”
of Heidegger’s thinking, that abysmal lack of certainty which
characterizes his leap, in fact constitute its possibility? Might not
