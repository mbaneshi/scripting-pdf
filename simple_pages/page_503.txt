Forum Day Four: Session Three 489
ERHARD
That’s quite right, it’s not reaction. Is the back of my hand reacting to the front of my hand? No. 
It’s correlated to the front of my hand, isn’t it?
BOBBY
Right.
ERHARD
Another word for correlation is something like dancing. You and I dance together; you don’t 
move because I move. I don’t move because you move. We move in correlation with one 
another. Our motion is correlated. That’s what correlated is: It’s like dancing. You need a poetic 
understanding of correlation. Like dancing. Clear?
BOBBY
I don’t understand how catching the dictionary is like dancing.
ERHARD
It’s exactly like dancing. And what you’re dancing with is a fl ying dictionary. And Ellen dances 
with the ball as uncatchable sometimes and at other times she dances with the ball as catchable. 
In both cases, Bobby, her actions are perfectly correlated to the ball.
BOBBY
No thinking.
ERHARD
It’s not a matter of “no thinking.” There may be thinking as well. That’s not the point. The point is 
that her actions are perfectly correlated to the ball when she’s graceful and perfectly correlated to 
the ball when she’s clumsy. That’s why I got someone who was athletic up, because he looks clumsy 
when I throw the ball to him in a way that he can’t catch it. That’s pretty clumsy. When I throw the 
ball to him so that it looks catchable to him, he’s very graceful in his dealing with it. Clear?
BOBBY
Yeah.
ERHARD
Thank you.
(addressing another participant)
What’s your problem?
(laughter)
BECKY
I don’t get that when I’m driving fast it occurs slow. I’m not even sure I said that accurately.
