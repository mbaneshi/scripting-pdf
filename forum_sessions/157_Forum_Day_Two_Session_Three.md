ERHARD
You avoided the domination of your father by giving in.
MIKE
Right.
ERHARD
How much energy did your father put into fi xing you?
MIKE
He kept pointing out all the wrong things I did.
ERHARD
So you dominated your dad by getting him attached to your stupidity, right? Like Brer Rabbit.
That was his relationship to you, trying to deal with your stupidity.
MIKE
When he was trying to correct me.
ERHARD
What other payoff s did you get out of being stupid? Did you get to be right? Did your father get
to be wrong?
MIKE
I got to be right about being dumb.
ERHARD
Did you identify strongly with your father?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
So you made what you identifi ed with right.
MIKE
Correct.
ERHARD
What did it cost you to have a racket called being stupid?
MIKE
I stopped talking with my dad.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
So there was a loss of relationship?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
A certain loss of love.
MIKE
Loss of my self.
ERHARD
You lost self-expression. You cut off  that avenue of self-expression called intelligence.
MIKE
Okay.
ERHARD
What about happiness?
MIKE
I was sad that I couldn‚Äôt make my dad happy.
ERHARD
Got it.
MIKE
I still don‚Äôt understand why the whole crowd was laughing at the beginning.
ERHARD
I don‚Äôt know. Why were they laughing at the beginning?
KIPP
They laughed when he stood up and said he didn‚Äôt know what his racket was.
ERHARD
Mike, you‚Äôve been in here for a little while right? People thought I was insulting when I called
them assholes. That was like a ‚Äúdamned with faint praise,‚Äù not an insult. Asshole is a fairly high
level. People are really stupid. Are you tuned in?
