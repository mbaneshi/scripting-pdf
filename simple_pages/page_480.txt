SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
And you are in deep thought with yourself.
DARRELL
But what does it mean? It doesn’t mean anything.
KIPP
Right.
DARRELL
In these four days I’ve been talking about myself to people I don’t even know. It was useful. It 
feels good. I feel that I don’t have to go around with this act. I don’t have to keep myself separate 
because I’m afraid people will fi nd out who I really am. I’m happy with that. Thank you!
(applause)
KIPP
Well done. Thank you!
HARRIET
I’m feeling tremendous energy that it is to choose to take the microphone and to be willing to 
engage in the conversation, and not know anything about being right, and what the in-order-to 
is. Just feeling the energy of the danger and the danger of the energy be used by power and all 
that. Now I feel stupid.
KIPP
Now you’re just here.
HARRIET
I’m just here. And I’ve been afraid to engage in conversation, wanting to be right in the 
conversation, wanting to be reasonable, wanting to wait for just the right moment to share the 
right thing. 
KIPP
It’s a very big one, that business of waiting for the right moment, the right thing, the right way 
to do it, that’s a killer. 
HARRIET
It has a lot to do with signifi cance. I have to make everything extremely signifi cant and 
extremely important. 
KIPP
Everything has to be extremely signifi cant and extremely important?
