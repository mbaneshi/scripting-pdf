Forum Day Four: Session Three 515
ERHARD
You’re trying to address what I put out there using your approach. And you need a little bit of
your approach. But we don’t need to discuss that; you’ll come up with that with your genius
in that quarter. You don’t need to discuss that with me. What you need to do is create the
possibility and to let yourself be free in the possibility. All the rest of it you’re thrown to.
WALT
Okay, so create the possibility.
ERHARD
Yeah, that’s what I said. You can have anything out of The Forum you can stand for having
gotten. “Stand for having gotten” and “create the possibility” are synonymous.
WALT
And that’s the declaration.
ERHARD
Yeah. That’s: generate a conversation for.
WALT
So if I don’t screw with that, it’s going to be all right.
ERHARD
Yeah, just handle that... No, I don’t know whether it’s going to be all right. All I know is that
you’re going to have power in the face of the risk that life is. That’s all I promised you. I didn’t
promise you things would be all right. I promised you the power and ability. I don’t know about
all right.
WALT
Thanks, Werner.
ERHARD
Yes, you’re welcome.
(applause)
Bill? Stand up.
Bill stood, the participant from the chocolate/vanilla demonstration, who also confronted Erhard on
the fi rst day of The Forum concerning being pressured to be in the course.
(continuing)
It’s called equal time, Bill. It’s called “only fair.”

SPEAKING BEING
BILL
I don’t really have anything to discuss that I am confused about, but it’s what has set me free
that makes me feel a lot better about my experience here. For one thing, I want to thank you
Werner for tolerating my controlling nature.
ERHARD
Yeah, and you and I needed to tolerate each other for it to work and so I want to thank you for
tolerating my controlling nature, too.
BILL (to laughter)
I came in this Forum with somewhat of a chip on my shoulder,
(laughter)
...and I was kind of angry. I had a lot of rackets that I couldn’t see until many of you stood up to
discuss them.
ERHARD (to the group)
This is called being big. This is called magnanimous. And it’s not that he is that. He gives
himself that in this action.
BILL
Anyway, I found that for myself I have a tendency to try to analyze behavior and try to explain
things on my terms in order for me to be in a controlling advantage. I don’t like to be controlled
at all. And at fi rst I felt like I was being controlled.
ERHARD
The word’s “dominated.”
BILL
Exactly. But what I was shown is that I can’t empower anybody. I lose love, lose self-expression,
and I lose freedom.
ERHARD
And you lose power. When you dominate you lose power. Love is power. Happiness is power.
Self-expression is power. Power is having your self realized in the world. That’s power.
BILL
Right. I fi nd that through letting that controlling element go and accepting myself for the way
I am, recognizing that I’m always already being that way, and yet being able to accept myself
more, and it was especially a release to fi nd out that things I was putting a contingency on: My
happiness is not contingent upon anything.
ERHARD
That’s right. We’re about to talk about your happiness. You’re in the right place. Keep going.
