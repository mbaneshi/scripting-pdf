KIPP
Chocolate or vanilla: Choose.
BILL
Vanilla.
KIPP
Vanilla! Perfect! Why did you choose vanilla? “I chose...”
BILL (to laughter)r
Can you give me a hint?
KIPP
A choice is to select freely and after consideration... “I chose...”
BILL
I chose vanilla because I want to experiment with a new taste.
KIPP
Perfect! So along came a thought—peep!...
(pulling another tissue out of the box
(
)
“because I want to experiment with a new taste,” right? And “because I want to experiment
with a new taste” selected vanilla, and not you: That’s a clear-cut decision because it’s based on
the reason, the feeling, the consideration, the thought...
(holding many tissues)
See we’re starting to get “the mind” built here. This is what the mind is made up of, all those
things, those thoughts, those feelings, those considerations. And you’re doing great, training
everyone in the room in these distinctions. I know it may not feel that way to you, but you’re
doing great. Ready?
The demonstration continued, with Bill selecting a fl avor after Kipp presented the choice: because
he only had two choices; because it’s there; because he decided to, etc. At each juncture Bill reiter-
ated his complaint that he knew the problem (how to make a choice using the word because, when
using because leads to making a decision) but that he didn’t know how to get out of it.
BILL
I chose because I exhausted all my reasons.
KIPP
So the reason—peep!

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP (pulling another tissue out of the box
(
)
“I’ve exhausted all my reasons” is a reason. It doesn’t sound like a reason, but it’s a reason. And
so the selection of chocolate was once again based on a reason. It was based on something; a
choice is based on nothing, except you saying so. Chocolate, vanilla: choose!
BILL
Vanilla.
KIPP
Perfect! Why did you choose vanilla?
BILL
I chose vanilla because I decided to...
(Kipp pulls out another tissue, wafting it will a string of “peeps”)”
Because I chose to.
KIPP
Okay, okay. Let’s check it out again. Chocolate or vanilla: choose!
BILL
Chocolate.
KIPP
Perfect! Why did you choose chocolate?
BILL (hesitating)
I have to use because?
KIPP
Yes.
BILL (to laughter)r
I don’t see any way to develop from this.
KIPP
Right. You’re distinctioning something. You’re distinguishing something, and you’re doing
great. Chocolate or vanilla: choose!
BILL
Chocolate.
