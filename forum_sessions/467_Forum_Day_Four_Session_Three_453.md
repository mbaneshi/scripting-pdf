Forum Day Four: Session Three 453
the boss. She was eleven years younger than me. That was a little harder. It took longer but I
turned her into an authority fi gure. And if you’re over twenty I’ll do that to you.
(laughter)
Somehow I’ll make you boss. If you’re under twenty, I’ll have an edge for a little while. I didn’t
see the cost; didn’t see the racket very plainly until this Forum. And I saw that I did it at my job.
Also, I own a company. I’ve got three other partners, and one isn’t even an equal partner, he’s
got ten percent of the company. Two are younger than I am and I’ve turned them all into my
bosses. I made one into the president and I call him the boss. I’ll do that. You can count on that.
KIPP
It’s a great way to avoid the responsibility of your own power.
VINNY
Exactly, not to be dominated by my own power, and the cost is everywhere. But the choice, to
choose, the ability to choose that that’s that: That’s my racket. And to choose that—there’s a
tremendous freedom in that, tremendous possibility to actually not have to be run by the racket.
So thank you.
KIPP
Thank you!
MONTY (to laughter)
Thanks for calling on me, fi nally! It’s my fi rst share! I did the training in ’78 and I didn’t share,
a couple of seminars and I didn’t share. And when we were dealing with that fear thing the
other night, I couldn’t see my fear, but there was sadness. That was the feeling I got up. And I
get a lot of tears, through you and through everybody’s stories. But I can’t contact my fear. I’m
up to being scared shitless. That’s why I got up here to share; I always fi nd a way not to. And I’m
standing and it’s okay. Fear runs me. That’s my major racket. It makes it possible for me to be
invisible; it’s okay to be invisible and not count. Every mealtime I go through a panic, who am I
going to eat with? Am I going to be alone? Can I just walk off  into the city and avoid being with
anybody? Everyone’s been so generous to me. People gave me a ride back home. I’ve met more
people here in these days than I’ve met and been with.
(choking up)
I’m overwhelmed. I don’t know what this thing’s about, but the people in this room are
available to me.
KIPP
That’s what it’s about.
MONTY
I’m really getting that. And I’m so pissed off  that I’ve let myself be run by this fear thing, that I have
to be alone with no friends. It’s all horseshit. And so choosing that is kind of a challenge for me.

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
Moment by moment by moment by moment choosing that.
MONTY
Right. In and out of, and I’m sure, I get I’m real excited about what I’ve realized and then it’s
gone.
KIPP
You have no muscles in this area yet. You have teeny-weeny baby muscles in this area. What
this work is about, what the seminar’s about is the Nautilus of Possibility.
(laughter)
It’s true! You have no muscles for this. You cannot stay unhooked for more than fi ve minutes.
Somebody who looks like your mother walks by, and you’re three years old: You’re gone! It’s not
bad to be weak. It’s just stupid to lie about it if you are. That’s what’s been disempowering you.
Not your weakness. It’s been your act of saying that you’re not. The moment you get to be weak,
you can start building some muscle. It’s going to take everything you got in your life. You’ve got
to have people around you that are more committed to you than you are.
MONTY
That’s what it is. The people I’ve met here are more committed to me than I’ve ever been
committed to myself in my whole life.
KIPP
The conversation that comes with being a human being is not on your side. On my pillow in the
morning, the conversation that’s never there—I never wake up into: “Why don’t you get up and
jog?”
(laughter)
Never, it’s always a committee about how many times I’ve done it already this week, what the
weather’s like, why I really shouldn’t today because I need my rest. It’s never on my side; it’s
always telling me: “Slow down. What are you doing this to yourself for? No jogging. What you
need to do for yourself is get up and go to the fridge, pull out that piece of chocolate cake you
didn’t eat last night, bring it back to your bed, eat it in bed, and then sleep some more.”
MONTY
It’s real easy for me to make, like you and Wes and Werner, and other people, like not... not be
like that. And therefore...
KIPP
We’re not like that? That’s true. Yeah, you can be like us someday.
(Monty laughs and so does Kipp)
He’s not sure!
