Forum Day Two: Session Three

KIPP
“I’m not smart enough to sweep” never happened.
Erhard joined Kipp on the platform.
ERHARD
Mike, it’s something you became. Did “I’m not smart enough to sweep” ever happen?
The tone here was very quiet and still—the interaction was delicate, Mike somehow fragile.
MIKE
I don’t understand; I need more clarifi cation. I know that I missed places.
ERHARD
Did it happen that you missed places?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
Did it happen that your father pointed out where you missed?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
Did “I’m not smart enough to sweep” ever happen?
MIKE
I guess not.
ERHARD
What do you mean, you guess? Guess is part of your racket about being stupid. I want you to get
something: you became “I’m not even smart enough to sweep.” You didn’t just think it. You didn’t
”
just have that thought. You became “I’m not smart enough to sweep.” You made yourself into
“I’m not smart enough to sweep.”
Erhard sat on the edge of the platform facing Mike. The room was very still. Kipp sat nearby on the
platform edge.
MIKE
I became “I’m not smart enough to sweep.”

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
You made yourself into “I’m not smart enough to sweep.” It wasn’t true; It wasn’t false: Because
that’s not something that’s true or false. It’s just something you became.
MIKE
Okay.
ERHARD
What’s the payoff  in becoming that?
MIKE
I didn’t have to try any harder, so I gave up.
ERHARD
One of the payoff s was, you avoided the responsibility of having to produce the result. You
avoided the domination of the responsibility for producing. Your brothers and sisters were dom-
inated by the need to produce. You avoided that domination.
MIKE
Correct.
ERHARD
Good. When did you fi rst have this conversation about being stupid?
MIKE
Eight or nine years old.
ERHARD
What happened that that became a conversation?
MIKE
Another time I was sweeping, I missed a spot.
ERHARD
And you became stupid at some point. You’ve got as much sense as anybody does. You started
being stupid when you were eight or nine years old as a way of dealing with what was going on
with your dad. It’s a way of being you took on. What other payoff s are there?
MIKE
I didn’t have to fi ght my dad back in fi ghting that I was stupid.
