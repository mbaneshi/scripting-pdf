SPEAKING BEING
JANE
No, I don’t.
ERHARD
Okay, thank you. You can sit down now if you want.
(applause as Jane sits)
ERHARD
You became that there’s something wrong. The question is: What did you do about it? The
answer is that from there on out, everything you did, everything you are, most particularly what
you’re really good at, was a response to, a way of dealing with, that there’s something wrong!
Your best moments, what you’re best at, what you’re most confi dent at, the best things in your
life... You got married—listen up!—you got married because there’s something wrong. It was
a way to deal with that there’s something wrong. No shit. I didn’t say your marriage wasn’t
wonderful. Your marriage may be the greatest thing that ever happened, but you got married
because there’s something wrong.  You had kids because there’s something wrong. You chose
your profession because there’s something wrong. You live your life because there’s something
wrong. And you developed the answers—that you got to what to do about the fact that there’s
something wrong—to a very high level. You’re really good at a lot of things, aren’t you? Really!
There are things you are really good at. The things you’re really good at—listen up. I know you
don’t get it yet—the things you’re really good at started out, had their genesis, are at the source a
way of dealing with that there’s something wrong. Here’s the evidence for my assertion: nothing
satisfi es you. Nothing satisfi es you. The things that you’re good at don’t satisfy, don’t nurture
you, don’t fulfi ll you, don’t leave you full of joy. They gratify you, because they make up for the
fact that something’s wrong. But they don’t fulfi ll you, don’t leave you full of joy, don’t leave you
fulfi lled. They don’t leave you complete. Did you ever notice, you’re never complete? Never. No
matter what you accomplish. No matter what you build, no matter what you create, no matter
what pleasure or accomplishment or satisfaction there is in your life, it’s never enough.
(Erhard moves around the room, speaking very loudly and forcefully)
And it’s never enough because you’re never going to be anything enough. You see, this is the
other side of the coin. We were talking about the bad stuff  before. I’m talking about the good
stuff . I’m talking about the good stuff  in your life: you know, your marriage, your romance,
your love aff air, the job that you’re very good at, that you’ve really developed your real skills in.
The stuff  in life that people can really count on you for. Your contributions to other people, the
diff erence you’ve made in life: that’s also only in the service of making up for the fact that you
are that there’s something wrong. The evidence for that assertion is that even the things that
you’re the best at, even the things that are the fi nest part of you, like your contributions to other
people, like the diff erence you’ve made for other people, like the sacrifi ces you’ve made for the
benefi t of other people—you know, you raised children all your life and you’ve done a great job
at it, and it’s still fucking not enough. You know you gave, gave, gave, and after a while you stop
giving, because it’s not enough to make up for “there’s something wrong here.” Yeah. Nothing.
Nothing. Nothing’s good enough for you, because nothing is for being good enough. Nothing is
Clearly, in a thinking that requires our familiar way of
thinking to be put under the possibility of deconstruction or
erasure, one is inherently at risk. This point was made repeatedly
by Heidegger, and is central to the rhetorical strategy of Werner
Erhard. The identity, the subject, the cogito, which is presently
dominating the clearing and thus confounding the appearing of
Being, does not want to be displaced. In clearing our “there,” in
unconcealing the clearing, we render our subjectivity homeless:
this is essential, since in our being “put out of the home in this
way, the home first discloses itself as such.” Thus the event of
unconcealment is also “the happening through which human
beings become homeless” (IM 186). Always on the way, we have
no home. No wonder we resist.
In Being and Time, in a passage which Erhard has quoted,
Heidegger states that any attempt to analyze Being “constantly
has the character of doing violence, whether to the claims of the
everyday interpretation, or to its complacency and its tranquilized
obviousness” (BT 359; quoted in “Heart of the Matter”). Heidegger
has further expressed this violent characteristic by describing the
opening for Being, not as a sylvan and tranquil clearing, but as the
turbulent battleground of a breach: “Historical humanity’s Being-
here means: Being-posited as the breach into which the excessive
violence of Being breaks in its appearing, so that this breach itself
shatters against Being” (IM 181). The sense of “historical” here
is not that of mere facts and trivia; rather, it has to do with the
making of history that occurs in moments when the way in which a
human being understands itself transforms, leaps from identifying
with what Erhard has termed the “story” to Being-in-the-world as
a new possibility for Being. Any transformation threatens what is
already there—held in place as it is by the “they” self who seeks to
reduce, or level down, Being to accommodate the averageness of
the everyday.
Thus, this fundamentally threatening nature of
unconcealment produces in Dasein what Heidegger calls the “will
to conquer that at the same time shrinks back” (IM 196). The task
at hand is forbidding: to be on the way, Dasein must engage in a
violent struggle to wrest Being from unconcealment, and in the
struggle must risk itself essentially. “Here,” writes Heidegger,
Forum Day Three: Session Four
295
for being complete. Everything is for making up for that there’s something wrong here. What
gives you your life—more accurately, sorry, more accurately—what gives you your self, what
gives you your identity, the person you’ve built yourself into being, was built in response to
(speaking each syllable with equally intense emphasis)
that there is some-thing pro-found-ly wrong. Now if you need evidence, what you’ve got to use
for evidence is “what is it that’s left you full of joy?” What is it? Look, there are eight hundred
people in here in this room. There’s got to be some pretty remarkable accomplishments in this
room. People of remarkable accomplishment; there’s got to be people in here who have made
ridiculous contributions. There’s got to be people in here who have saved people’s lives, there’s
got to be people in here who have nurtured people’s lives, there’s got to be people in here who
have impacted whole communities, there may be people here who have made important,
signifi cant contributions to countries, and there’s not one person in here satisfi ed. Not one
person in here truly, completely, wholly fulfi lled. Not one person in here full of joy. That’s my
evidence.
(calling on a participant)
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 8)
I’ve done some looking at this and I have a question and we can use me as a case in point.
When I was in the third or fourth grade, a few things happened close together, where I got
really embarrassed, and I decided that no one was going to embarrass me that way again. No
one is ever going to laugh at me again. Out of that I became a master student, head of the class,
straight A’s all the way through college. Awards, degrees, all sorts of honors and no satisfaction.
My fi rst wife made a fool of me and so in my second marriage I married someone that would
never leave me. It’s all a solution to “no one is ever going to make a fool of me again.”
ERHARD
Right.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 8)
So all the things you’re saying I can really see in my life, where what could really be
accomplishments are I’m making a point and I’m making sure there’s no satisfaction.
ERHARD
Right because there’s no satisfaction in compensating for being “there’s something profoundly
wrong here.” All you do is what? Reinforce down there at the bottom that there’s something
wrong here.
(asking a participant to stand up; Erhard pushes against his shoulders)
It’s kind of like this: whatever you’re pushing up against, you’re attached to. I’m attached to
him, just as surely if he held me close to him. In fact I’m more attached to him than if he held
me close to him because he doesn’t have to do any of the work; I do all the work.
“
the uncanniest possibility of Dasein shows
itself: to break the excessive violence of
Being through Dasein’s ultimate act of vio-
lence against itself. Dasein does not have this
possibility as an empty way out, but it is this
s
possibility insofar as it is; for as Dasein, it must
indeed shatter against Being in every act of
violence. (IM 197)
M
As we show in our series of sidebars on Technology (during the
third and final session of Day Four), The Forum provides an
opportunity for Dasein’s calculative machinations to be seen for
what they are, and the game is up. Yet only through this struggle
can Dasein become itself, and serve its constitutive role as the
site for the disclosure of Being: the struggle is “an act of violence
against the overwhelming, but at the same time always and only
for it” (IM 196).
Heidegger has at times described this ongoing struggle in
oppressive terminology:
“
the renewed resurgence of the act of violence
against Being, in such a way that the almighty
sway of Being violates Dasein (in the literal
sense), makes Dasein into the site of its appear-
ing, envelops and pervades Dasein in its sway,
and thereby holds it within Being. (IM 198)
M
In his later work, it must be noted, Heidegger’s languaging of
unconcealment is less violent: it is articulated more gently as a
turning-toward Being, a releasement of and into Being. However,
we emphasize the element of resistance here (as has Heidegger)
because such resistance characterizes much of the dialogue
in The Forum (as well as many discussions of Erhard himself).
Erhard does not attempt to minimize this resistance; in fact, he
acts strategically to unconceal it. For instance, early on Day One of
The Forum, aft er confronting the participant Bill concerning being
pressured to be in The Forum, Erhard asked, “Why was I bad with
296
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (continuing)
(participant sits down)
So if your accomplishments are there as an answer to that there’s something wrong, to make
up for that there’s something wrong, to deal with that there’s something wrong, then the more
you accomplish the more powerfully the context—listen!—the more powerfully the context that
there’s something wrong is established. See look...
(moving to the chalk board.)
Remember the two circles, “tall” in two contexts? Suppose the context is “there is something
wrong.” The more content you build, the more achievement, the more accomplishment, the
more content builds, the more fulfi lled the context becomes. Anybody who can’t see that?
SUZANNE
I don’t understand.
ERHARD
Okay, thank you.
SUZANNE
I don’t understand the statement that the more achievement one has, that there’s something
wrong.
ERHARD
Good. Did you see that she asked the question very precisely? Real big opening to get the
answer. What I said was that “that there’s something wrong” becomes—you become that
there’s something wrong; you are that there is something wrong. In other words, “that there is
something wrong” is the clearing in which life happens now. It’s the opening for life to occur.
It’s the space in which everything arises. You clear about that statement so far? That’s not the
answer yet, but are you clear about that so far?
SUZANNE
Is it, “that there’s something wrong,” is it the cause and the achievement is the eff ect? Or...
ERHARD
Not quite, no. Sorry. The answer is no, and it’s like that, but it’s not that. It’s “that there’s
something wrong” is the context, and the achievement is the content in that context.
SUZANNE
So, the achievement is not an eff ect of “there’s something wrong.” It’s a context.
ERHARD
It is a content of the context “there is something wrong.” See hold on for a second. This business
about cause and eff ect you and I understand, and are very comfortable with. You don’t have
to think that, you have those thoughts. You think in a cause/eff ect world. But the world of
you just now? Because I want to get this story up. There’s a lot of
people with that story here and I want to get that story killed.”
This unconcealing clears the way for the appropriation of the
resistance: participants in the dialogue, by recognizing, allowing,
and owning their resistance, become who they are, in preparation
for the disclosure of their possibility.
Lest the view of Dasein as scene-of-violent-unconcealment be
taken as unduly negative, Heidegger adds an important point:
“
This [talk of violence] looks like pessimism. But
it would be preposterous to label Greek Dasein
with this term—not because the Greeks were
somehow optimists at bottom aft er all, but
because these assessments miss Greek Dasein
altogether. The Greeks were, to be sure, more
pessimistic than a pessimist can ever be. They
were also more optimistic than any optimist.
Their historical Dasein had not yet entered the
realm of pessimism and optimism. (IM 197–198)
M
This way of thinking, in which relatedness with Being allows
the transcendence of subjective value dualities, appears to come
into play within Heidegger’s and Erhard’s ethics. While the results
of The Forum, to whatever degree they manifest themselves in
participants’ lives, are certainly played out in the moral arena,
morals (and their contemporary variation, “values”) are an ontic
issue, and the essential content of The Forum is ontological.
Here we think Joseph J. Kockelmans, synthesizing Heidegger,
expresses Erhard’s view as well: “Every valuing, even if it values
in a positive manner, is and remains a subjectivizing; it does not
let beings be. To call God the highest value is to degrade the true
essence of God” (On the Truth of Being 258). Being is not moral.
Being “is” not anything except Being.
The rhetorical conversation of The Forum, rather than taking
morality as its content, approaches morality indirectly, by way
of Being. Here, we wish to underline Heidegger’s point: that the
violence of the act of unconcealing Being is the “flip side” of the
Forum Day Three: Session Four
297
being is not like that quite. There’s causality too, but there’s a more subtle relationship, one of
context and content. Contexts don’t cause contents. The relationship is not one of causality. It’s
a diff erent relationship. But it’s like cause and eff ect, but not the same.
SUZANNE
I’m equating achievement as power.
ERHARD
I don’t have any problem with that. However, achievement, even as power, in the context
“there’s something wrong,” each achievement reinforces the context: the more achievement,
the stronger, more forceful the context. As you build content, you validate the context. So for
example, if I say two, and three, they’re content in the context called numbers. You follow that?
SUZANNE
Yes I follow that.
ERHARD
Very good. If I go on to seventy-four, ninety-nine, one third, and three point one four, I’ve
expanded the amount of content, and by doing so I’ve validated the context called numbers. The
context called numbers has gotten stronger and stronger. Even if the content is empowering,
nevertheless the context is more and more validated. Clear?
SUZANNE
There is an aspect in that logic on what’s wrong: that area I’d like to explore.
ERHARD
Please.
SUZANNE
I don’t see... I still don’t understand that statement. I’d like to go deeper. But then, not that
I’m confused. I got an equation of the earlier, I never, I don’t want to share. But this particular
premise strikes me because of achievement, the word achievement I equate with power.
ERHARD
First off , you’ve got your foot nailed to the fl oor about achievement a little bit—like some of you
had your foot nailed to the fl oor about God and some of you had your foot nailed to the fl oor
about sincerity—it’s kind of like you have idolized accomplishment a bit. Accomplishment is
kind of like the Holy Grail for you. A little bit, and so it makes the conversation a little bit hard
for you to hear. A little bit it sounds like I’m denigrating accomplishment. I’m actually not
denigrating accomplishment, but never mind, it sounds like I am. Does it not?
SUZANNE
It did at the beginning.
attainment of the clearing of aletheia (please see the sidebar “The
Three Levels of Truth” in Session Two of Day Four). Both positive
and negative, emergence and concealment, violence and aletheia,
are constitutive of Being. This idea is worked out most fully in
Heidegger’s conception of the “Nothing.” ■

راهی برای مقابله با آن مشکلی وجود دارد. بدون گه من نگفتم ازدواج شما نبود
فوق العاده ازدواج شما ممکن است بزرگترین کاری باشد که تاکنون اتفاق افتاده است ، اما شما ازدواج کردید
زیرا مشکلی وجود دارد شما بچه داشتید زیرا مشکلی وجود دارد. شما انتخاب کردید
حرفه شما زیرا مشکلی وجود دارد. شما زندگی خود را زندگی می کنید زیرا چیزی وجود دارد
اشتباه و شما پاسخ ها را ایجاد کردید - که به این واقعیت که وجود دارد به چه کاری باید انجام دهید
چیزی اشتباه است - به یک سطح بسیار بالا. شما واقعاً در بسیاری از موارد خوب هستید ، مگر نه؟ واقعاً مواردی وجود دارد که شما واقعاً خوب هستید. چیزهایی که شما واقعاً در آن خوب هستید - لیست کنید. من تو را می شناسم
هنوز آن را دریافت نکنید - چیزهایی که واقعاً در آن خوب هستید ، پیدایش آنها را در منبع A قرار داده است
روش مقابله با آن مشکلی وجود دارد. در اینجا شواهدی برای ادعای من وجود ندارد: هیچ چیز
شما را راضی می کند. هیچ چیز شما را راضی نمی کند. چیزهایی که شما در آن خوب نیستید ، رضایت ندهید
شما ، شما را برآورده نمی کنید ، شما را پر از شادی نکنید. آنها شما را خوشحال می کنند ، زیرا آنها را جبران می کنند
واقعیت این است که چیزی اشتباه است. اما آنها شما را برآورده نمی کنند ، شما را پر از شادی نمی کنند ، شما را ترک نکنید
FULFI LLED آنها شما را کامل نمی کنند. آیا تا به حال متوجه شده اید ، هرگز کامل نشده اید؟ هرگز هیچ
مهم است که چه کاری انجام می دهید. مهم نیست که چه چیزی می سازید ، مهم نیست که چه چیزی ایجاد می کنید ، مهم نیست
چه لذت یا موفقیت یا رضایت در زندگی شما وجود دارد ، هرگز کافی نیست. (Erhard در اطراف اتاق حرکت می کند ، با صدای بلند و زور صحبت می کند)
و این هرگز کافی نیست زیرا شما هرگز به اندازه کافی نمی خواهید. می بینید ، این است
طرف دیگر سکه. ما قبلاً در مورد چیزهای بد صحبت می کردیم. من در مورد خوب صحبت می کنم

واضح است ، در تفکر که به روش آشنا ما نیاز دارد
فکر می شود که تحت امکان ساختارشکنی قرار گیرد یا
پاک کردن ، یکی ذاتاً در معرض خطر است. این نکته به طور مکرر بیان شد
توسط هایدگر ، و در استراتژی بلاغی ورنر مهم است
erhard هویت ، موضوع ، cogito ، که در حال حاضر است
تسلط بر پاکسازی و در نتیجه گیج کننده ظاهر شدن
بودن ، نمی خواهد آواره شود. در پاک کردن "آنجا" ، در
از پاکسازی پاکسازی ، ذهنیت خود را بی خانمان می کنیم:
این ضروری است ، زیرا در این بودن "در این خانه از خانه خارج شده است
راه ، خانه اول خود را به این ترتیب فاش می کند. " بنابراین رویداد
عدم پذیرش همچنین "اتفاقاتی است که از طریق آن انسان
موجودات بی خانمان می شوند "(IM 186). همیشه در راه ، ما داریم
بدون خانه جای تعجب نیست که ما مقاومت می کنیم. در وجود و زمان ، در یک گذرگاه که Erhard نقل کرده است ،
هایدگر اظهار داشت که هرگونه تلاش برای تجزیه و تحلیل "دائماً"
شخصیت انجام خشونت را دارد ، خواه ادعاهای
تفسیر روزمره ، یا به نارضایتی و آرامش بخشش
بدیهی است "(Bt 359 ؛ به نقل از" قلب موضوع "). هایدگر
این ویژگی خشونت آمیز را با توصیف آن بیان کرده است
باز برای وجود ، نه به عنوان یک پاکسازی سیلوان و آرام ، بلکه به عنوان
میدان نبرد آشفته یک نقض: "وجود بشریت تاریخی-
در اینجا به معنای: به عنوان نقض بیش از حد در آن قرار می گیرد
خشونت از شکستن در ظاهر آن ، به طوری که این خود نقض شود
در برابر وجود "(IM 181). حس" تاریخی "در اینجا
این واقعیت ها و چیزهای بی اهمیت نیست. در عوض ، این مربوط به
ساخت تاریخ که در لحظاتی اتفاق می افتد که در آن
انسان می فهمد که خود را دگرگون می کند ، از شناسایی جهش می کند
با آنچه Erhard "داستان" را در جهان بودن نامگذاری کرده است
یک امکان جدید برای وجود. هر تحول آنچه را که هست تهدید می کند
در حال حاضر در آنجا - همانطور که توسط خود "آنها" که به دنبال آن است ، در جای خود قرار گرفته است
کاهش یا پایین آمدن ، قرار گرفتن در حد متوسط ​​بودن
روزمره بنابراین ، این ماهیت اساساً تهدیدآمیز
عدم پذیرش در Dasein آنچه هایدگر را "اراده می نامد تولید می کند
برای تسخیر این مسئله در همان زمان به عقب برگردد. »(IM 196)
در دست این ممنوع است: برای حضور در راه ، داسین باید درگیر شود
مبارزات خشونت آمیز برای دست و پنجه نرم کردن از عدم وجود و در
مبارزه باید اساساً خود را به خطر بیندازد. هایدگر می نویسد: "اینجا"
روز اول انجمن: جلسه چهارم
295
برای کامل بودن همه چیز برای جبران این امر است که در اینجا مشکلی وجود دارد. چه
زندگی خود را به شما می دهد - با دقت بیشتر ، ببخشید ، دقیق تر - چه چیزی به شما می دهد ، چه
هویت خود را به شما می دهد ، شخصی که خودتان را در آن ساخته اید ، در پاسخ به آن ساخته شده است
(صحبت کردن هر هجا با تأکید به همان اندازه شدید)
که برخی از مواردی که از آن گذشته است اشتباه است. حال اگر به شواهدی احتیاج دارید ، آنچه را که باید استفاده کنید
برای شواهد این است که "چه چیزی شما را پر از شادی می کند؟" چیه؟ ببین ، هشتصد نفر وجود دارد
مردم اینجا در این اتاق. در این مورد باید دستاوردهای بسیار قابل توجهی وجود داشته باشد
اتاق مردم دستاورد قابل توجه ؛ در اینجا باید افرادی باشند که ساخته اند
مشارکتهای مسخره. در اینجا باید افرادی باشند که جان مردم را نجات داده اند ، وجود دارد
باید در اینجا افرادی باشند که زندگی مردم را پرورش داده اند ، باید در اینجا افرادی باشند که
کل جوامع را تحت تأثیر قرار داده اند ، ممکن است در اینجا افرادی وجود داشته باشند که اهمیت داشته باشند ،
مشارکتهای قابل توجه به کشورها ، و در اینجا یک نفر وجود ندارد. نه یکی
شخص در اینجا واقعاً ، کاملاً ، کاملاً کامل است. یک نفر در اینجا پر از شادی نیست. این من است
شواهد (تماس با یک شرکت کننده)
شرکت کننده (رهبر انجمن 8)
من به این موضوع نگاه کرده ام و یک سؤال دارم و می توانیم از من به عنوان یک مورد استفاده کنیم. وقتی در کلاس سوم یا چهارم بودم ، چند اتفاق نزدیک با هم اتفاق افتاد ، جایی که من به آنجا رسیدم
واقعاً خجالت کشید ، و من تصمیم گرفتم که دیگر کسی قصد ندارد من را از این طریق خجالت بکشد. هیچ
یکی دیگر قرار است دوباره به من بخندد. از این طریق من دانشجوی کارشناسی ارشد ، رئیس کلاس شدم ،
مستقیم A از طریق کالج. جوایز ، مدرک ، انواع افتخارات و رضایت. همسر اول من احمقانه ای از من ایجاد کرد و به همین ترتیب در ازدواج دوم من با کسی ازدواج کردم که چنین می کرد
هرگز مرا ترک نکن این همه راه حل برای "هیچ کس نمی خواهد دوباره من را احمق کند."
درز
درست شرکت کننده (رهبر انجمن 8)
بنابراین تمام چیزهایی که می گویید من واقعاً می توانم در زندگی خود ببینم ، واقعاً کجا می تواند باشد
دستاوردها من یک نکته را بیان می کنم و مطمئن هستم که هیچ رضایت نامه ای وجود ندارد. درز
درست است زیرا هیچ رضایت از جبران بودن "چیزی عمیق وجود دارد
اینجا اشتباه است. " تمام کاری که شما انجام می دهید این است که در پایین آن چیزی را تقویت کنید که چیزی وجود دارد
اینجا اشتباه است (از یک شرکت کننده درخواست ایستادن ؛ ارهارد علیه شانه های خود فشار می آورد)
این نوع ای از این دست است: هر آنچه که به آن فشار می آورید ، به آن متصل هستید. من به
او ، به همان اندازه مطمئناً اگر او مرا نزدیک او نگه داشت. در واقع من بیشتر از او به او وابسته هستم
من به او نزدیک هستم زیرا او مجبور نیست هیچ یک از کارها را انجام دهد. من تمام کارها را انجام می دهم "
غیرعادی ترین احتمال نمایش Dasein

از طریق عمل نهایی Dasein vio-
در مقابل خود لنس. Dasein این را ندارد

همانطور که در سری نوارهای جانبی خود در مورد فناوری نشان می دهیم (در طول
جلسه سوم و آخر روز چهارم) ، این انجمن ارائه می دهد
فرصتی برای ماشین های محاسبه کننده Dasein برای
آنها چه هستند و بازی تمام شده است. با این حال فقط از طریق این مبارزه
آیا دزین می تواند خودش شود و نقش سازنده خود را به عنوان خدمت کند
سایت برای افشای وجود: مبارزه "یک عمل خشونت است
در برابر قریب به اتفاق ، اما در عین حال همیشه و فقط
برای آن "(IM 196). هایدگر در بعضی مواقع این مبارزه مداوم را توصیف کرده است
اصطلاحات سرکوبگر:
"
تجدید تجدید عمل خشونت
در برابر بودن ، به گونه ای که متعال
نوسان بودن دزین را نقض می کند (در تحت اللفظی
حس) ، داسین را به سایت ظاهر خود می کند-
در حال تغییر و تحول ، پاکت و فرسوده است ،
و بدین ترتیب آن را در درون وجود دارد. (IM 198)
مگس
در کار بعدی خود ، لازم به ذکر است ، زبان هایدگر از
عدم پذیرش کمتر خشونت آمیز است: به آرامی به عنوان یک بیان می شود
موجودی در حال چرخش ، بازگرداندن و وجود. با این حال ،
ما در اینجا بر عنصر مقاومت تأکید می کنیم (همانطور که هایدگر)
زیرا چنین مقاومت بسیاری از گفتگوها را توصیف می کند
در انجمن (و همچنین بسیاری از بحث های خود Erhard). Erhard تلاش نمی کند تا این مقاومت را به حداقل برساند. در واقع ، او
به صورت استراتژیک برای عدم استفاده از آن عمل می کند. به عنوان مثال ، اوایل روز اول
این مجمع ، در مورد صورتحساب شرکت کننده در مورد بودن
Erhard با فشار برای حضور در انجمن ، پرسید: "چرا من با آن بد بودم

برای این کار اشتباهی وجود دارد ، برای مقابله با آن اشتباه است ، پس بیشتر

خوب آیا دیدید که او این سؤال را دقیقاً پرسید؟ دهانه بزرگ واقعی برای به دست آوردن
جواب آنچه من گفتم این بود که "که مشکلی وجود دارد"
مشکلی وجود دارد تو هستی که مشکلی وجود دارد. به عبارت دیگر ، "وجود دارد
مشکلی نیست "آیا پاکسازی که اکنون زندگی در آن اتفاق می افتد. این آغاز زندگی است. این فضایی است که در آن همه چیز بوجود می آید. شما تاکنون در مورد آن بیانیه پاک هستید؟
هنوز پاسخ دهید ، اما آیا تاکنون در مورد آن روشن هستید؟ سوزان
آیا این ، "که مشکلی وجود دارد" ، آیا این علت است و دستاورد آن است؟ یا ... erhard
نه کاملاً ، نه. ببخشید جواب نه ، و اینگونه است ، اما این طور نیست. این "وجود دارد
اشتباه "متن است ، و دستاورد محتوا در آن زمینه است. سوزان
بنابراین ، دستاورد مؤثر نیست "مشکلی وجود دارد". این یک زمینه است درز
این محتوای متن است "مشکلی وجود دارد". برای یک ثانیه نگه دارید. این تجارت
در مورد علت و استفاده از شما و من می فهمیم و با آن بسیار راحت هستیم. شما ندارید
به این فکر ، شما آن افکار را دارید. شما در یک دنیای علت/اثر فکر می کنید. اما دنیای
شما الان هستید؟ از آنجا که من می خواهم این داستان را بالا ببرم. تعداد زیادی وجود دارد
مردم با آن داستان در اینجا و من می خواهم آن داستان را کشته کنم. "
این عدم پذیرش راه را برای تصرف آن پاک می کند
مقاومت: شرکت کنندگان در گفتگو ، با شناخت ، اجازه ،
و داشتن مقاومت آنها ، در آماده سازی ، به چه کسی تبدیل می شوند
برای افشای احتمال آنها مبادا دیدگاه داسین به عنوان صحنه-خشونت آمیز-غیرقانونی باشد
هایدگر به عنوان منفی منفی ، نکته مهمی را اضافه می کند:
"
این [صحبت از خشونت] مانند بدبینی به نظر می رسد. اما
برچسب زدن Dasein یونانی عجیب خواهد بود
با این اصطلاح - نه به این دلیل که یونانیان بودند
به نوعی خوش بینانه در پایین همه ، اما
زیرا این ارزیابی ها دزین یونانی را از دست می دهند
در کل مطمئناً یونانیان بیشتر بودند
بدبین از یک بدبین می تواند همیشه باشد. آنها
همچنین از هر خوشبین خوش بین تر بودند. داسین تاریخی آنها هنوز وارد نشده بود
قلمرو بدبینی و خوش بینی. (IM 197-198)
مگس
این روش تفکر ، که در آن ارتباط با وجود اجازه می دهد
به نظر می رسد متعالی بودن دوگانگی های ارزش ذهنی ، به نظر می رسد
بازی در اخلاق هایدگر و Erhard. در حالی که نتایج
از انجمن ، به هر درجه ای که خود در آن آشکار می شوند
زندگی شرکت کنندگان ، مطمئناً در عرصه اخلاقی بازی می شود ،
اخلاق (و تنوع معاصر آنها ، "ارزش ها") یک بر روی آن است
مسئله ، و محتوای اساسی این انجمن هستی شناختی است. در اینجا ما فکر می کنیم جوزف جی. کوکلمن ، سنتز هایدگر ،
دیدگاه Erhard را نیز بیان می کند: "هر ارزش ارزشی ، حتی اگر ارزش آن را داشته باشد
به روشی مثبت ، موضوعی است و همچنان باقی می ماند. اینطور نیست
اجازه دهید موجودات باشند. این که خدا را بالاترین ارزش بنامیم ، تخریب واقعی است
جوهر خدا "(در مورد حقیقت 258). بودن اخلاق نیست." بودن "بودن" چیزی نیست جز بودن. گفتگوی بلاغی انجمن ، به جای گرفتن
اخلاق به عنوان محتوای آن ، به طور غیر مستقیم به اخلاق نزدیک می شود
از وجود در اینجا ، ما می خواهیم نکته هایدگر را تأکید کنیم: که
خشونت عمل عدم تحرک "طرف تلنگر" است
روز اول انجمن: جلسه چهارم
297
بودن کاملاً اینگونه نیست. علیت نیز وجود دارد ، اما یک رابطه ظریف تر وجود دارد ، یکی از آنها
متن و محتوا زمینه ها محتویات ایجاد نمی کنند. رابطه یکی از علیت نیست. این است
یک رابطه متفاوت اما این مانند علت و عارضه است ، اما یکسان نیست. سوزان
من دستاورد را به عنوان قدرت برابر می کنم. درز
من هیچ مشکلی با آن ندارم. با این حال ، دستاورد ، حتی به عنوان قدرت ، در متن
"مشکلی وجود دارد" ، هر دستاورد متن را تقویت می کند: دستاورد بیشتر ،
متن قوی تر و نیرومندتر. وقتی محتوا می سازید ، زمینه را تأیید می کنید. بنابراین برای
به عنوان مثال ، اگر من دو و سه را بگویم ، آنها در متن به نام اعداد راضی هستند. شما آن را دنبال می کنید؟ سوزان
بله من آن را دنبال می کنم درز
خیلی خوب اگر من به هفتاد و چهار ، نود و نه ، یک سوم و سه امتیاز یک چهار نفر بروم ، من
میزان محتوا را گسترش دادم و با این کار زمینه به نام اعداد را تأیید کردم. در
متن به نام اعداد قوی تر و قوی تر شده است. حتی اگر محتوا توانمند باشد ،
با این وجود زمینه بیشتر و بیشتر اعتبار دارد. پاک کردن؟ سوزان
جنبه ای در این منطق وجود دارد که اشتباه است: آن منطقه ای که می خواهم کشف کنم. درز
لطفا سوزان
من نمی بینم ... من هنوز این جمله را نمی فهمم. من می خواهم عمیق تر بروم. اما پس از آن ، نه
من گیج شده ام من یک معادله از اوایل دریافت کردم ، هرگز ، نمی خواهم به اشتراک بگذارم. اما این خاص
فرضیه به دلیل دستاورد به من اعتصاب می کند ، کلمه دستاورد من با قدرت برابر است. درز
اول از همه ، شما پای خود را کمی در مورد موفقیت در مورد موفقیت قرار داده اید - مانند برخی از شما
پای خود را در مورد خدا میخ زده بود و بعضی از شما پای خود را به سمت کف می زد
درباره اخلاص - این نوع مانند شما است که دستاورد را کمی بت پرست کرده اید. موفقیت است
نوع مانند گریل مقدس برای شما. کمی ، و بنابراین مکالمه را کمی سخت می کند
برای اینکه شما بشنوید کمی به نظر می رسد که من در حال تحقیر موفقیت هستم. من واقعاً نیستم
تحقیر موفقیت ، اما هرگز مهم نیست ، به نظر می رسد که من هستم. اینطور نیست؟ سوزان
این کار در ابتدا انجام شد. دستیابی به پاکسازی Aletheia (لطفا به نوار کناری "
سه سطح حقیقت "در جلسه دو روز چهار). هر دو مثبت
و منفی ، ظهور و پنهانکاری ، خشونت و آلتیا ،
سازنده هستی هستند. این ایده به طور کامل در آن کار شده است
برداشت هایدگر از "هیچ چیز". ■
