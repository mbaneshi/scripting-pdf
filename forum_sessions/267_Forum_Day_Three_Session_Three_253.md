Forum Day Three: Session Three 253
BEVERLY
I’m at one point today and I’ll be at another point tomorrow.
ERHARD
And another point the day after that. And after that you’ll be in another point. On and on until
there are no more points and they’ll throw dirt in your face.
BEVERLY
I want to make it easier for me to get to points faster.
ERHARD
No. You won’t get there any faster.
BEVERLY
Then where am I going?
ERHARD
Nowhere. There’s nowhere to go. You already got there.
(loudly)
There’s no place to go! You already got there! You don’t like it now that you’re there? That is
too fucking bad.
BEVERLY
I think there’s another way of looking at it.
(laughter)
ERHARD
Beverly, there are always other ways of looking at it and all of them are unenlightened.
BEVERLY
Why did I pay $625?
ERHARD
You paid $625 to be that life is empty and meaningless, and that it’s meaningless that life is
empty and meaningless. You paid $625 to fi nd out that life isn’t going to be diff erent. Like it’s
always been: it is like it is. You don’t live life like it is what it is. You live life like “it’s going to
be diff erent.” And that makes you an asshole. It’s not a bad thing to be, just a thing to be, like
a fart. All the stuff  we did... everything we’ve done up to now was to get to the point where we
could have this discussion. I told you up front that we were going to keep moving back until we
got to zero. Empty and meaningless is as zero as you can get.

SPEAKING BEING
BEVERLY
And so now we’re going to progress somewhere?
(laughter)
ERHARD
No no. See, if we progress somewhere then we’d have to get back to zero again.
BEVERLY
And so we’re going in a circle to get back to zero.
ERHARD
No, we’re going to be at zero.
BEVERLY
And then we’ll be happy.
ERHARD
I don’t know. But I am certain that you will if you are. You’ll never be happy waiting for it to
turn out. You’re never going to be happy trying to get it to move faster. Listen carefully. You’re
never going to be happy waiting for the right tool, or the right answer with which to be related.
If you’re going to be related, you’re going to have to be related like this. Just like this. This is not
a practice session for the real relationship. This is the real relationship. That’s what you want to
get. This is it. It’s not going to work out because it has already worked out. This is what you got
to be related in and this is all you’re ever going to have. You’re always only going to have what
you got. You’re never gonna have what you don’t got and are waiting for. If you get that, that
should give you a very powerful sense of freedom. And take a great big burden there and let you
be with the relationship you already have.
Erhard had been sitting on the platform edge, talking very directly to Beverly, who stood about seven
rows back. He was very focused and deliberate throughout the exchange.
ERHARD
Is that a little clearer?
BEVERLY
Yes.

RICHARD
Last night someone I was staying with in the room told me that I snored. I stayed up late last
night, trying to make sure that... I told them I wouldn’t snore and I stayed up most of the night
to make sure I wouldn’t snore. So it’s not quite a divorce and not quite a divorcee’s roommate. I
