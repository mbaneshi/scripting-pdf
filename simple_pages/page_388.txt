SPEAKING BEING
The saying and talking of mortals comes to pass from early
on as legein, laying. Saying and talking occur essentially as
the letting-lie-together-before of everything which, laid in 
unconcealment, comes to presence. (EGT 63)
T
[. . .] Such a letting-lie establishes whatever lies before us as 
lying-before. It establishes this as itself., i.e., a letting-lie-before 
of what does lie before us, gathered in the selfsameness of its 
lying-before [. . .]. This exceptional laying is the legein which
comes to pass as the logos. (EGT 66)
T
This was the challenge for the first philosophers: to bring Being—the realm of 
meaninglessness and possibility from which the meanings and possibilities were 
made distinct—to stand in the world: “Physis and logos are the same. Logos char-
acterizes Being in a new and yet old respect: that which is in being, which stands 
straight and prominently in itself, is gathered in itself and from itself, and holds itself 
in such gathering” (IM 145).
