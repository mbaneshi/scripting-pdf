SPEAKING BEING
You can’t even put a circle in one dimension. Before you can have a circle you have to create
the two dimensions. So we’re creating diff erent dimensions in this conversation. Okay, so we’ll 
jump dimensions somewhat.
TIM
So, your invitation to me is to look at the possibility that the word “problem” can exist in a dif-
ferent dimension than with “solution.”
WES
Yeah: a diff erent context in which you will not be immediately moved to solve it. 
TIM
Got it.
WES
Hold on a second. What you’re bringing up is great. This whole thing about problem/solution: 
Here’s one thing that people almost always never get. 
Wes walked over to a the chalkboard on stage right and erased “Right/wrong; dominate/avoid domi-
nation; justifi es itself/invalidates others.”
WES (continuing)
Take a look at any problem that you’ve had and look at what you’ve done with it. What you’ve done
with it is: solved it in some way. The way people solve problems is they do something about it, and 
if that didn’t work, they do something more, and if that didn’t work, they do something better, and
if that didn’t work, they do something diff erent. They are led to dealing with it, solving it.
(drawing a “P” on the board and then encircling it)
You’ve got a problem, and then you solve it. What happens with regard to the solution to the
problem? 
TIM
It becomes a truth, or something right, the right thing to do.
WES
Yes. But it’s worse than that. You have to actually look at a problem that you’ve had that you’ve solved
and then look at the solution to see what happened to it. Take a look at a problem that you had.
TIM
I’m thinking: Some solutions become problems.
WES
Yes, exactly! The solution becomes your next problem.
WES (continuing)
