Forum Day Three: Session Four

KEVIN
What the reaction was all about?
KIPP
No, exactly what you said, that you didn’t trust. The way you got trust, trust isn’t available. Trust
to you is accounting.
KEVIN
Right.
KIPP
So when you’re bored, you get this big accounting sheet with everybody’s name on it.
Kipp did an entertaining demonstration of Kevin’s view of trust: as a matter of accounting, using a
list he carried with him crossing people off  whom he did not trust.
KIPP (continuing)
And you walk down the path of life, with your little pad with everybody’s name on it, and “you
remember twelve years ago we were working on that thing, I wanted to do that thing, but you
got to and I didn’t?”
(crossing off  that person’s name on an imagined  list)
“Seventeen years ago, that company picnic, you walked over to the boss and started talking to
him? And he stopped talking to me?”
(crossing off  another person’s name; pointing at another person)
“You didn’t do anything but someone with a beard like that did.”
(crossing yet another name off  the list, to laughter)
That’s what you call trust.
KEVIN
But my list is way longer.
KIPP
There’s no trust there, just adding up and keeping track.
KEVIN
That’s right.
KIPP
Trust. I’m inviting you to consider that maybe, trust is simply, “I trust you.”
you don’t get it—for a long time—and then you get it, all at once.
This is the moment of insight that Heidegger calls Augenblick—a
moment of vision—and he says it occurs as a leap:
“
There is no bridge here—only the leap. [. . .]
The leap alone takes us into the neighborhood
where thinking resides. [. . .] In contrast to a
steady progress, where we move unawares
from one thing to the next and everything
remains alike, the leap takes us abruptly to
where everything is diff erent, so diff erent
that it strikes us as strange. [. . .] Though we
may not founder in such a leap, what the leap
takes us to will confound us. (WCT 8, 12)
T
On the other hand, he cautions:
“
Leap and vision require long, slow preparation. . . .
(WCT 233)
T
Nobody can in just one single leap take dis-
tance from the predominant circle of ideas, es-
pecially not if he is dealing with the well-worn
tracks of traditional thinking—tracks that fade
into realms where they can hardly be seen.
(“DL” in OWL 36)
Only one who takes the right running start can
leap. Everything is decided by this run, for it
means that we ourselves actually ask the ques-
tions again, and that we, in these questions,
first create the perspectives. (IM 196)
M
Yet it is important to remember, again, that while we are on the
way to language and thinking, we are always within language and
thinking. Therefore the paradox and reflexivity continues, once we
have made that leap:

SPEAKING BEING
KEVIN
But I don’t.
KIPP
That’s right. I didn’t say to. I’m not manipulating you into trusting. I’m not advocating it...
ERHARD
He’s not going to get that because he still doesn’t get the distinction between assertion and
declaration. Kevin, did you know that you did your whole number in your response to Kipp?
You did “stingy”; you did “don’t risk”; you did “nobody does it right.”
KEVIN
Yeah.
ERHARD
Like counting down. That was totally automatic.
KEVIN
Yeah.
ERHARD
Not one thing you said had a shred of intelligence in it. I want you to listen to what I’m saying.
It was not an expression of your intelligence. It was not an expression of your common sense. It
was an expression of your act—limited completely to your act. You had no choice in the matter.
It was not some product of an intelligent choice or a commonsensical choice.
KEVIN
I’ll accept that.
WES
So you got the assignment?
KEVIN
Yes.
WES
I just want to acknowledge your willingness to be in this conversation.
KEVIN
I just wanted to say to everyone else in the auditorium, that I’m safe to be around. It’s not
that bad.
“
And where have we leapt? Perhaps into an
abyss? No! Rather, onto some firm soil. Some?
No! But on that soil upon which we live and
die, if we are honest with ourselves. A curious,
indeed unearthly thing that we must first leap
onto the soil on which we really stand. (WCT 41,
T
emphasis added)
In distinguishing the leap, Heidegger continues the reflexivity that
characterizes his thought: we leap to where we already are.
In Being and Time, he says that Dasein “is existentially that
which, in its potentiality-for-Being, it is not yet. . . .  [O] nly because
it is what it becomes (or alternatively, does not become), can it say
to itself ‘Become what you are’ and say this with understanding”
(BT 185–186). Scholar Joan Stambaugh calls this movement of
thinking an “ongoing reaching that belongs to what it reaches”
(ID 14).
As we have noted elsewhere, such reflexivity is central to the
thinking of Zen, as Erhard has observed: “In Zen, one is working
toward enlightenment from and in a context of already being
enlightened” (Bartley 125). ■
