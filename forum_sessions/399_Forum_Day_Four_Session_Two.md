Forum Day Four: Session Two

ANABETH
So it‚Äôs just there.
KIPP
Yeah, it‚Äôs just there, and sometimes it uses your life.
ANABETH
Well yeah, that‚Äôs the answer.
KIPP
What‚Äôs missing for you is any choice about it.
ANABETH (pausing thoughtfully
(
)
What‚Äôs missing for me is any choice about it.
KIPP
Yeah, so far in your life, your life has not been a chronicle of choosing whether you‚Äôre going to
do your racket or not. Your racket used you, without choice.
ANABETH
Right. I did not choose. Right.
KIPP
So, what‚Äôs missing for you is a distinction called ‚Äúchoice.‚Äù See, when you come from empty and
meaningless, into life, you‚Äôre left with a choice. But we haven‚Äôt distinguished choice yet; we‚Äôre
still working on reasonableness. Can you see that that‚Äôs missing for you?
ANABETH
Yes. Okay.
KIPP
Anabeth: thank you very much.
(applause)
CLAUDIA
I saw that what stops me from participating is the fear that I have of all you people, which...

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
It‚Äôs not fear. Remember, fear is inside the box of the racket. Fear is the emotion consistent with
the racket. It‚Äôs not the fear. It‚Äôs the racket. And the racket has those emotions. It has the feelings
consistent with that racket. Yeah.
CLAUDIA
What I saw in the danger process yesterday was that the reason I was afraid of other people, I
was afraid of everybody looking at me. One of my rackets is handling everything so that in my
relationships or at my job, everything is so set that people aren‚Äôt looking at me.
KIPP
What do you mean ‚Äúlooking at you‚Äù?
CLAUDIA
I mean looking at me with your eyes.
KIPP
You‚Äôre afraid of people looking at you.
CLAUDIA
Yes.
KIPP
Got it.
CLAUDIA
So, that has really stopped me from participating. This year I had lots of opportunities to speak
in front of people, and although one on one people have told me that I am articulate, and some-
times entertaining, I thought I would be good at speaking in front of groups of people and I was
miserable at it. I didn‚Äôt do very well and they criticized me in feedback.
KIPP
Or: You did what you did.
CLAUDIA
I did what I did. I didn‚Äôt enjoy it...
KIPP
You did what you did and people said what they said. The problem is you listened to them.
CLAUDIA
Right. So I realized that I stayed away from things that would cause me to stand up in front of
people to speak.
