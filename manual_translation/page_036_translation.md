SPEAKING BEING
RAY
Thank you.
Shortly before the fi rst break of the morning, Erhard introduced a new topic: 
ERHARD
The next subject is the matter of your being here. At the upcoming break, you will be given an 
opportunity to leave and have your money refunded. You want to listen up! I’m going to give
you the opportunity not to be here. You shouldn’t be here if you didn’t put yourself here. The 
Forum won’t work for you anyhow, so you’re wasting your time here. You shouldn’t be here if 
you’re here because you were threatened. We don’t allow people to participate in The Forum
who were coerced or threatened. You may have been here on that basis up till now. You can 
leave now and you’ll get all your money back. And if you’ll get in trouble with whoever you’re
here for, I’ll write a note that says that you begged and pleaded and tried to stay here and I 
threw you out. If you’re here because you were pressured into being here, would you stand up 
please?
(one participant stood)
Anybody else?
(another long pause as another stood) 
I’m going to say “Anybody else?” fi ve more times.
Eventually several people stood in response to his request, and he began to interact with them
individually. The interactions varied strikingly in their tone. With the fi rst participant, a teenager 
named Kathy, Erhard’s manner was quite gentle. He moved closer to her, standing at a distance of 
about four feet. Before beginning the conversation, he asked her if she was willing to interact with 
him in front of the group, acknowledging that it might be “scary” for her to do so. He then reiterat-
ed his assertion that pressure, like embarrassment and hustle, was a clearing she was bringing to 
the circumstances:
ERHARD (continuing)
I know that if you’re here because somebody pressured you to be here, that that’s an issue in 
your life. The only people who experience being pressured about The Forum are those for 
whom pressure is an issue. I’m giving you the opportunity to make a choice. Now that I’ve
given you the choice, would you like to leave or would you like to be here? There will be no bad
results from you leaving. You’ll get your money back. 
KATHY 
That’s good. I feel like I have the opportunity to choose now, whereas, before, I didn’t feel like
that.
on the first day when participants’ stories about the events in 
their lives are distinguished from the events themselves.
Human beings exist in a world of meaning, and their 
relationship with that world is fundamental. In-ness is an aspect
of Dasein’s existence from the ground up. Consider: a human
being never exists as a (meaningful) human being until she exists
in-the-world, and when she leaves the world (dies), she ceases to
exist (as a human being). Heidegger’s German term for the Being-
in relationship (Sein bei) carries the implication of what we would
call being at home (BT 80, note 3). Dasein is at home in the world,
T
Being-with others. “Being-with” is examined in the first sidebar of 
Session One of Day Two, and we address the “world” of Being-in-
the-world at the beginning of Session One of Day Four. ■
