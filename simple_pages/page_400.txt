SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
It’s not fear. Remember, fear is inside the box of the racket. Fear is the emotion consistent with
the racket. It’s not the fear. It’s the racket. And the racket has those emotions. It has the feelings
consistent with that racket. Yeah.

What I saw in the danger process yesterday was that the reason I was afraid of other people, I 
was afraid of everybody looking at me. One of my rackets is handling everything so that in my 
relationships or at my job, everything is so set that people aren’t looking at me.
KIPP
What do you mean “looking at you”?
CLAUDIA
I mean looking at me with your eyes.
KIPP
You’re afraid of people looking at you. 
CLAUDIA
Yes.
KIPP
Got it.
CLAUDIA
So, that has really stopped me from participating. This year I had lots of opportunities to speak
in front of people, and although one on one people have told me that I am articulate, and some-
times entertaining, I thought I would be good at speaking in front of groups of people and I was
miserable at it. I didn’t do very well and they criticized me in feedback.
KIPP
Or: You did what you did.
CLAUDIA
I did what I did. I didn’t enjoy it...
KIPP
You did what you did and people said what they said. The problem is you listened to them.
CLAUDIA
Right. So I realized that I stayed away from things that would cause me to stand up in front of 
people to speak.
