SPEAKING BEING
not going to like. You’re sitting there now with a whole bunch of assessments and conclusions.
We’ve done this a lot. I can even tell you what your assessments and conclusions are.
A participant asked whether, based on all of this, he should keep his specifi c issues and concerns
foremost in his mind.
ERHARD
You don’t need to have something you’re kind of holding in place. We will hook what’s there
in you that’s appropriate to be hooked and pull it up to the surface. So you can kind of relax 
about that. A lot of stuff  you won’t even think about will get handled in here.
Another participant asked about the history of the organization.
ERHARD
We’ve been doing this work since 1971 and it was at the end of 1984 that we fi nished a four-
year process of developing The Forum, and we’ve been off ering The Forum since 1985 all over 
this country, and in lots of other countries around the world.
At this point, a man named Jake rose to complain about the purpose of the evening session, to
which participants had been encouraged to invite guests.
JAKE
Isn’t that more for Werner Erhard and Associates to hustle more members?
ERHARD
You know that you are a hustle waiting to happen, right?
JAKE
I said I feel like I’m being hustled.
ERHARD
I said you are a guy who is being hustled waiting to happen.
JAKE
I don’t mind being hustled.
ERHARD
I said you are a guy who is being hustled waiting to happen.
JAKE
I don’t see it that way.
Erhard came down from the stage and sat on the edge of the platform near him.
Dasein
At the outset, it is important to introduce a term that is central 
in Martin Heidegger’s work, and will therefore begin to come up 
here almost immediately.
Dasein is Heidegger’s word for the Being of human beings,
and is one of the few terms in English editions of his writing 
that consistently remain untranslated from the German. In 
fact, the 2014 Dictionary of Untranslatables, published by
Princeton University Press, calls the word “a paradigm of the 
untranslatable,” and devotes six double-columned pages to a
struggle to explain it (Adam Gopnik, “Word Magic,” New Yorker,. 
May 26, 2014, 37).
A problem with translating this term, of course, is that term
is central in Heidegger’s most important work, Being and Time, 
in which he presents his ontological model of human beings. 
The specific elements of this model will be discussed in further 
detail as we proceed. For now, it is sufficient to note that Dasein 
will be spoken of as if the term indicates an individual; but since
it indicates the Being of that individual, it refers at the same time 
more broadly to the collective Being of human beings.  
ERHARD (continuing)
