Forum Day Three: End of Day Three Interval 309
Throughout this book, we are proposing that both Heidegger and Erhard make
important use of reflexive languaging—ideas presented in such a way that they turn
thinking back upon itself, pulling the rug out from under the reader or the listener 
(e.g., “This statement is false”). We suggest that the reflexive impulse (reflex, reflec-
tion, self-referentiality, getting the joke) pervades the thinking and the languaging 
of both men, most dramatically when they are saying the Nothing. These reflexive 
processes share a particular aff inity with the movement of thinking that makes
available an experience of Being, and one view is that they evoke a cul-de-sac.
At a debriefing meeting between sessions of the 1989 Forum, Erhard told The 
Forum leaders that the “critical condition of satisfaction” for doing The Forum is 
that for the participants it must be inescapable. That is, in Heidegger’s terms, all 
exits by which the they-self might escape an authentic confrontation with its own 
thrownness must be closed. To this end, a cul-de-sac may be a useful model; and
The Forum’s culminating distinction (as well as the final process of the est Training)
t
may be seen as eff ective speaking of that form.
The French existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre evoked the cul-de-sac image in the
title of his play, No Exit; and one of Heidegger’s most important essays, published in
1947 as the “Letter On Humanism,” was written, in part, as a response to an essay 
by Sartre. A comparison of Sartre’s thinking with Heidegger’s is beyond the scope of 
this book, but we will gloss the diff erence in this way: for neither man is there an exit 
from the trap of the human situation; but for Heidegger, the appropriation of that
situation—the appropriation of entrapment—creates the possibility of authentic 
entrapment. The situation becomes the Situation, which gives releasement.  ■
