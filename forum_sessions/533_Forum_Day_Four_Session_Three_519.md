Forum Day Four: Session Three 519
feel and the way you think, and the way you see things, about which you’ve got nothing to say.
Nothing. In fact the way you see things has to do with the way you were when you were a little
girl or a little boy. Anybody not clear about that? I say you can’t say “I love you” to somebody
without checking your feelings, because if you say “I love you” to somebody and you didn’t
feel like it, that would be insincere, inauthentic for you; because your love is an expression of
your feelings. Who you are is your feelings. Who you are is your internal state. Anybody not
clear about the accusation? Good. Now I want to talk to you about a possibility beyond that
accusation, which arises in getting clear about the accusation. Anybody want to tell me they’re
not clear about the accusation now that they know what the consequences are? Stand up.
RALPH
Can you repeat the accusation?
ERHARD
Sure. I said you can’t say “I love you” to a guy you don’t know—you can’t walk up to someone
you don’t know and say “I love you,” because it’s not true! It’s just a bunch of words. Unless
you feel love for somebody you can’t say “I love you” and have it be authentic. I say that that’s
incontrovertible, clear cut evidence that you are your feelings. That’s who you are. You are your
internal state: your feelings, and your thoughts, and your attitudes. That’s who you are.
RALPH
Because you can say “I love you” without authenticity...
ERHARD
Because you can’t say “I love you” without feeling it.
RALPH
And be authentic.
ERHARD
And be authentic. Precisely. But when you say “authentic,” you mean say yourself “honestly,”
right?
RALPH
Yes.
ERHARD
And if you say “I love you” to somebody and you don’t feel it, that’s not saying yourself
honestly. Therefore it must be true that you are your feelings.
RALPH
That’s where I miss it. It’s that connection I miss.
Transformation as Technology
In the face of this subjection to the technological way of Being,
what is there for us to do? Certainly, any action can never have as
its objective the “mastery” of technology. “That would mean, aft er
all, that man was the master of Being” (“TT” in QCT 38). Besides, as
Dreyfus observes, the more we try to master technolo gy, the more

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Look. I say “I love you.” But it’s just a bunch of words, because I don’t feel it.
RALPH
But when you say “I love you” and you feel it, I don’t understand why that means I am my
feelings.
ERHARD
Because you can’t say “I love you” without feeling it.
RALPH
So who you are is just the state of what is true for you, whatever that state is. Feelings or not
feelings. When they are there.
ERHARD
When they’re not there, then it’s not there.
RALPH
Then who you say you are is a lie. So who you are is your feelings, only when who you are, who
you are saying who you are is really the feeling.
ERHARD
No, you got it too complex. This has to do with thinking. Listen: “I assert that you are your
feelings.” And you should say “Okay, I heard your assertion; what evidence do you have to
validate that assertion?” Then I say, “My evidence is: When you say ‘I love you’ to somebody, it’s
not authentic for you unless you feel it—hence the evidence there validating my assertion that
you are your feelings. Because the ‘I’ which you’re speaking is your feelings or it’s not authentic.
‘I love you’: ‘I’ refers to my feelings.”
RALPH
I got it.
ERHARD
Thank you. I assert “you are your feelings.” And my evidence for that assertion is you can’t
say “I love you” to somebody and have it be authentic if you don’t feel it. What you mean by
“I” is feeling. “Feeling loves you. And I am my feelings, therefore I can say ‘I love you’ if I feel
it. Because ‘I’ and feeling are one. I am my feelings.” This is the age of sincerity. In an age of
sincerity people identify with their feelings—I don’t like “identify” because it’s a psychological
term and this is an ontological conversation. So I don’t say people identify with their feelings, I
say “you are your feelings,” and their mood, and their attitude, and their state of mind, and the
way they see things, and what they believe in—“believe” being something like feeling it, seeing
it. You don’t have a special “believe” organ. “Believe” is constituted of perceptions and thinking
and feeling. So I’m accusing you of being your internal state. You are your internal state because
this is the age of sincerity. In an age of sincerity, what you meant is what’s really important.
technological we become (“Gaining”). During his conversation with
Jacob in Session Three of Day Three, Erhard said, “The attempt to
get out of the trap constricts the bars of the prison. The attempt to
get beyond the ‘this-is-all-there-is’ keeps you in the trap. Trying to
get out of the prison keeps you in the prison. And not trying to get
out of the prison keeps you in the prison.”
Having sounded the alarm, Heidegger has a suggestion—not
an answer, but a hint, which also is echoed in Erhard’s technology
of transformation in the distinction “getting off  it,” where we are
no longer constrained to entertain a given way of Being (an already
and always way of listening). “In the normal course of events,”
said Erhard in Session Five of Day One, “if I found out my already
always listening was disempowering I would try to stop it. He [the
participant in dialogue with Erhard] didn’t change it. That’s the big
secret. Because when you change it, nothing changes.” Heidegger’s
suggestion comes from these lines from the German poet
Hölderlin: “But where danger is, grows/The saving power also”
(“QCT” in BW 333). That is, at its root, technology’s danger is at the
same time Being’s gift . Therefore, Heidegger asks, “might not an
adequate look into what enframing is, as a destining of revealing,
bring the upsurgence of the saving power into appearance?”
(“QCT” in BW 334). Here, he specifies the conditions for such an
upsurgence:
Because the essence of technology is nothing
technological, essential reflection upon tech-
nology and decisive confrontation with it must
happen in a realm that is, on the one hand, akin
to the essence of technology, and, on the other,
fundamentally diff erent from it. (“QCT” in
BW 340)
“
Being given by the technological way of Being, swept up into the
in-order-to, we cannot but be given entirely by “its” aims. We
don’t run it; it runs us. But appropriating this lostness there at the
precipice that Nothing brings us to face, at the very moment we
can be in the trap of the in-order-to, the saving power surges up.
That is Erhard’s technology of transformation.
