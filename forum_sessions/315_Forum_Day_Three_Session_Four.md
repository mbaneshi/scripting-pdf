Forum Day Three: Session Four

out. And true to what you said yesterday it occurred to me that this was me running my victim
racket. I laughed at myself for a moment. And then I went to fi nd some people to go have
dinner with.
ERHARD
See, hold on a second. He’s a little bit ahead of us. I almost wish he didn’t say that because now
he’s leaked out the truth, and you’ll latch on to that real fast. That’ll be the new prison bars.
When you get that it’s empty and meaningless you see things you’ve never seen before. As long
as you’re stuck with your soap opera you can’t see those things. For instance, if who you are is
that people are unable, you can’t see the opportunities to develop their ability. And you can’t
see their ability. As soon as you get that that’s your racket, as soon as you get that whole soap
opera that you’ve got to do everything your self because there’s nobody around able enough to
do it, you begin to see things you didn’t see before. Now, I shouldn’t have told you that, you see,
because you’ll spend the whole night trying to fi gure out how to get out of the trap. And you’ll
come in here tomorrow all stuck in the trap again. We’ll have to spend the whole day getting
you out of the trap. And then we’ll have to do an extra day of The Forum with you all. Go ahead.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 9)
So I’m actually not going to ask the question now. But what I have gotten, and just to share,
one is that some people’s coaching for me recently is to take myself a little less seriously and I
can hear the room to be that way now. Secondly, is I’ve been able to share myself with people,
Werner, not like something happened.
ERHARD
To speak himself. Not in-order-to.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 9)
I can see as a graduate, staff  member, and Forum leader candidate, that that’s probably
something for all of us to take on, the sharing in-order-to business.
ERHARD
Good. Thank you.
(applause)
ALEX
What about a child who’s been told everything’s right?
ERHARD
That’s called Skinner’s “glass box,” and Skinner already demonstrated that it doesn’t work. Did
you get my answer?
ALEX
Yes.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
The other answer is that you don’t actually get that from what happens, you’re already always
that as a human being. In other words, you are “there is something wrong here” waiting to
happen. See listen, if we had the time, and we don’t—that’s another program—I would get up
enough people in here whose experience was almost always what you and I would call positive.
The athletic kids, the successful kids, the right kind of families. And you would fi nd out that
they had somehow fucked that up. It’s amazing. Hard to believe. There are people in here like
those kids we grew up with that we thought had it all. People like that in here. And if they stood
up and shared with you, they would tell you that it was bad.
ALEX
Yeah.
ERHARD
So there’s no way to escape it. Even if you’re told “you’re wonderful,” “you can have anything
you want,” “life is great.” Now, that is preferable over being told that you’re shit. No question
about that.
ALEX
That is my question. Is that preferable?
ERHARD
Oh sure. It’s kind of like carrying less baggage. You’re still going to carry the baggage. You’re
still going to get into the trap. You can’t keep your kids out of the trap.
ALEX
The kid is told “You can do anything you want to,” or the parent gets that child in as much
diffi  culty as to tell the child they’re worthless. Is it in the same elevator shaft, or is it diff erent?
ERHARD
That’s correct. I’ve looked at it as far as I can see it, and yes. But it’s too long of a conversation to
have right now.
LUCY
Two things. One I found this conversation the most powerful for me personally. The experiences
that I heard are very applicable to me.
ERHARD
One will hear oneself in other’s sharing.
LUCY
I think I understand why I don’t get a sense of fulfi llment out of the many things that I...
