KIPP
Yeah. He was there.
(laughter)r
Right. What the hell is he there for? That’s his job.
DOREL
The following night, I didn’t get angry. So what if it takes fi fteen minutes to let one car go.
KIPP
Right. If it takes fi fteen minutes, then it takes fi fteen minutes. And that’s the whole story. Get 
your car. Life is hard. And then you die. They throw dirt over your face, and that happens 
whether you get your car or not, whether you get it in two or fi fteen minutes.
DOREL (smiling)
I am just a goddamned bitcher and complainer in life. I get upset and angry and I bitch and
bitch and bitch and bitch.
KIPP
That’s right.
DOREL
So that’s the thing with me.
KIPP
Yeah. It’s interesting. You’re so honest in your speaking, it contributes to everybody in the room
a lot, Dorel. Your authenticity is powerfully contributing. It’s real. Makes a big diff erence for 
people. I was leading The Forum in London, and during the evening session after the four days,
a man stood and shared that his younger son came to him: “Daddy Daddy, Johnny hit me.” “Uh 
huh.” “But Daddy, you don’t understand, he hit me in the same place as before, where it really 
hurt!” “Uh huh.” “But Daddy, Johnny’s older and you said before he should know better not 
to hit me.” “Uh huh.” “Daddy, I don’t want you to go back to that seminar anymore because it 
makes you stupid!”
(laughter)r
DOREL (laughing)
Am I going to be stupid?
KIPP
Yes. What’s going to be stupid is: It’s going to take fi fteen minutes to get your car when it takes 
fi fteen minutes. And when you’re lost, you’ll be lost. And that’s life, yes? You don’t have to add 
simply one of the things that shows up in the clearing, that leaves
us free to be and free to act in life—free to be and free to act with
whatever we are dealing with in any situation.   This is critical for 
being a leader and exercising leadership eff ectively as one’s natu-
ral self-expression; and during the in-class sessions of the course 
access to this fundamental and essential nature of being for us 
human beings will be made available to you.
As was the case with the previous section (Section 2), during 
the course everything in this section will be gone over and made 
clear for you so that you can confirm its validity for yourself in
your own lived experience.  In addition, the critical importance of 
what has been covered in this section for being a leader and the 
eff ective exercise of leadership as your natural self-expression will
be dealt with in depth during the in-class sessions of the course. ■

all that other stuff  to it. As a matter of fact, when you’re lost, you could discover something. But
when you’re lost and angry, you’re too busy being angry to fi nd out anything beyond being lost 
and angry. Anything else?
DOREL
No. Thank you.
KIPP
Well done. Thank you very much.
WES
Wait a second, Kipp. Just to complete this: You have to deal with your own listening to this 
conversation. Consider the possibility that you are listening to the conversation about problems
like it would help you solve them. See that? It’s listening to this like “Oh, here’s new stuff  to help
me solve my problems.” That’s more of the same. This conversation is intended to create a new 
clearing for problems, which clearing will alter you and the problems in life. That’s the intention. 
If you were looking at Illiana’s face, she got a new clearing for this whole thing about attention. 
She still needs attention. She still has a racket. Still has the same job. But the occurrence “atten-
tion” occurs in a new clearing. This clearing will give her the opportunity to make new requests.
See, she’s never tried out being straight with people about giving her attention. Like...
(to Illiana, who is sitting)
“Would you give me some attention? Let’s stop for fi ve minutes. I’m producing great results. I
want you to listen to what happened to me today. Would you be willing to do that?” The racket 
is to do it and have a problem with doing it. Now you can just do it. By the way, this attention 
thing has something else behind it.
(to the group)
The point is that there’s a possibility for you and your problems to relate diff erently. A new 
clearing. You don’t have to remember any of this. No, there’s one thing you have to remember:
Your problems are part of your racket and your racket stinks. That’s all you need to remember.
That’ll create a new clearing for you.
At 3:30, Kipp asked participants to stand up and stretch and then sit back down.
KIPP
When you come into life from empty and meaningless, and you’re able to be with your racket,
what opens up for you is choice. However, you don’t know anything about choice. So we’re
going to spend some time distinguishing choice as choice. So when you say you’re going to do
something and you want to do it, you say what? You go out and make a what? A decision, yes? 
You say something like “I made a decision to do this.” First of all, we want to get choice and
decision distinct. The word “decide” comes from the same family as suicide, matricide, and


=== END OF PAGE 439 ===

=== PAGE 440 ===

426
SPEAKING BEING
patricide and all the cides—meaning to kill. Decide means to kill or murder the alternative. So
when you decide something you are destroying the alternative. “I’ve decided to do that!” That’s
a decision—based on something. “I’m deciding this because...” It’s always based on something.
What gives a decision is it’s based on something. Choice is not based on something. It’s based
on no thing or nothing. Choice is to select freely and after consideration, not limited by what-
ever the evidence that you have to give for a decision. The fi rst thing we need to do is to get
a decision to be a decision and a choice to be a choice so that they can live distinctly for you.
When you say choose, what you mean for the most part is decide. What you’re actually saying
is decide. We’re going to do a little demonstration with someone to distinguish a choice from a 
decision, so you can see it clearly for yourself, so you can see a choice in action.
Kipp asked for a volunteer who has not taken The Forum before, nor seen the demonstration. The 
participant chosen was Bill, the young man who had interacted so combatively with Erhard during 
Session One of Day One of The Forum.
KIPP (continuing)
Are you willing to do this demonstration, to stay with it all the way through, keep participating, 
even if it looks like it might be frustrating for you and you might not get it, and go right to the 
end and keep on playing?
BILL (smiling)
Couldn’t look any worse than I did on the fi rst day. So yeah, I’m willing.
KIPP
That’s true.
(laughter: to the group)
Okay, so. All right. Now, your job is not to coach Bill. A lot of the time when you are sitting in 
your chair and you don’t have whatever it is that you have when you’re standing there attempt-
ing to get it sorted out for yourself, where it’s sometimes a little more diffi  cult to see, so don’t
say it out loud, or coach him in some way. Let him struggle with it because it’s the inquiry into 
the distinction, the struggle that will bring forth the distinction. We’re not defi ning a distinc-
tion; we’re not explaining a distinction. We’re not describing choice. We want to see choice as a 
distinction in action. So Bill, I’m going to ask you to make a simple choice, and each time I ask
you to make a choice, you’ll say to me, “I choose...” whatever you chose, “because...” And you’ll 
fi ll in whatever comes after that for you, okay? You clear how to respond? Okay ready?
BILL
Yeah.
Kipp held out two hands as if he had an ice cream cone in each one.
KIPP (continuing)

KIPP (to Bill)
Chocolate or vanilla: Choose.
BILL (pointing at the hand representing chocolate
(
)
I choose chocolate... because I prefer the fl avor.
KIPP
Perfect. Okay, so, “I chose chocolate because I prefer the fl avor.” That’s a perfect decision,
because what selected the chocolate was what? What did the selecting?
BILL
I did.
KIPP
Well, if you really look at it, the reason, the thought, the consideration—“because I prefer
the flavor better”—came along, right?
BILL
Yeah.
KIPP (pulling a tissue out of a tissue box)
Like this little thought—peep!—comes along...
(dangling the tissue in the air)r
“I prefer the fl avor of chocolate better.”
(pointing at the tissue
(
)
And that reason, that consideration, that thought, selected the chocolate, didn’t it? Not you.
That’s what the selection was based on, wasn’t it?
BILL
Yeah.
KIPP
That’s a decision because it’s based on something. Perfect! That’s what your job is up here, so
everybody can see a decision as a decision, and a choice as a choice. Okay, ready?
(holding out his hands again to Bill)
Chocolate or vanilla: Choose.

SPEAKING BEING
BILL
Chocolate.
KIPP
Perfect! Now why’d you choose chocolate?
BILL (after a long pause)
I chose chocolate...
KIPP
Because...
BILL
If I put a because in there it’ll be a decision...
KIPP
We did this before, it works...
(laughter)r
“I chose chocolate because...”
BILL
I chose chocolate... because it’s black. I don’t know.
KIPP
Perfect! So, along came this thought...Peep!
(pulling another tissue from the box and dangling it
(
)
“Because it’s black.” And what did the selecting was the reason, the feeling, the thought, the
consideration, the evidence, the something did the selecting, not you. So that’s a clear-cut deci-
sion.
BILL
How do I get out of this?
KIPP
You keep inquiring, just like you’re doing. You’re doing perfectly. Okay? Ready to go again?
BILL
Yeah.

KIPP
Chocolate or vanilla: Choose.
BILL
Vanilla.
KIPP
Vanilla! Perfect! Why did you choose vanilla? “I chose...”
BILL (to laughter)r
Can you give me a hint?
KIPP
A choice is to select freely and after consideration... “I chose...”
BILL
I chose vanilla because I want to experiment with a new taste.
KIPP
Perfect! So along came a thought—peep!...
(pulling another tissue out of the box
(
)
“because I want to experiment with a new taste,” right? And “because I want to experiment 
with a new taste” selected vanilla, and not you: That’s a clear-cut decision because it’s based on
the reason, the feeling, the consideration, the thought...
(holding many tissues)
See we’re starting to get “the mind” built here. This is what the mind is made up of, all those 
things, those thoughts, those feelings, those considerations. And you’re doing great, training
everyone in the room in these distinctions. I know it may not feel that way to you, but you’re 
doing great. Ready?
The demonstration continued, with Bill selecting a fl avor after Kipp presented the choice: because 
he only had two choices; because it’s there; because he decided to, etc. At each juncture Bill reiter-
ated his complaint that he knew the problem (how to make a choice using the word because, when
using because leads to making a decision) but that he didn’t know how to get out of it. 
BILL
I chose because I exhausted all my reasons.
KIPP
So the reason—peep!

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP (pulling another tissue out of the box
(
)
“I’ve exhausted all my reasons” is a reason. It doesn’t sound like a reason, but it’s a reason. And 
so the selection of chocolate was once again based on a reason. It was based on something; a
choice is based on nothing, except you saying so. Chocolate, vanilla: choose!
BILL
Vanilla.
KIPP
Perfect! Why did you choose vanilla?
BILL
I chose vanilla because I decided to...
(Kipp pulls out another tissue, wafting it will a string of “peeps”)”
Because I chose to.
KIPP
Okay, okay. Let’s check it out again. Chocolate or vanilla: choose!
BILL
Chocolate.
KIPP
Perfect! Why did you choose chocolate?
BILL (hesitating)
I have to use because?
KIPP
Yes. 
BILL (to laughter)r
I don’t see any way to develop from this.
KIPP
Right. You’re distinctioning something. You’re distinguishing something, and you’re doing
great. Chocolate or vanilla: choose!
BILL
Chocolate.

Forum Day Four: Session Two 
431
KIPP
Perfect! Why did you choose chocolate?
BILL
I chose chocolate... because I enjoy choosing chocolate. 
KIPP (pulling out another tissue to a elongated “peep!”
(
)”
“I enjoy” is like a feeling, a thought, a consideration, a reason, isn’t it? It’s based on your enjoy-
ment. That reason came along and selected it again.
BILL
I do not know how to make a choice without... with using the word because. I must have missed 
something.
KIPP
You didn’t miss anything. They are real glad it’s you up here, not them. 
(applause)
When you come from life is empty and meaningless and you’re able to be with your racket,
choice opens up for you, but you don’t know anything about choice. Why we are working this 
way is to distinguish something called choice, and a choice is based on nothing: It’s a pure 
choice, simply because you choose. Chocolate/Vanilla: choose!
BILL (fi nally
(
)
I choose chocolate simply because I choose... chocolate.
The participants erupted in applause.
KIPP
The important thing is all his reasons, thoughts, feelings considerations, are still there, weren’t 
they? See, you think you have to get rid of these...
(holding up all the tissues he had pulled out of the box)
In order to make a choice. No. They are all still there, except his choice isn’t based on these.
He has his reasons, his thoughts, his feelings, his considerations, but he’s not being those. He’s 
being his choice. You think you have to get rid of all these, then you can make a choice. Yes? 
BILL
I thought that way. I think that way.

So far that’s what’s been available for you, is you thinking that this is what you got for your life, 
yes? If you can get enough of these lined up in one way or the other, it will give you the action 
that you want.
BILL
Yes.
KIPP
Exactly. What’s been missing for you is the distinction choice, for you “Bill,” and for you “human 
being.” It doesn’t come with being human. You don’t come equipped with that one. You’ve got to 
invent that one. You want to test this now to make sure you and everybody else is clear about it?
BILL
Sure.
KIPP
Bill, why is the fl oor down there?
BILL (looking down)
It’s just there?
KIPP
It’s where? The fl oor is down there because...?
BILL (laughing)
It doesn’t choose to be there. That’s for sure.
KIPP
Good, Bill. So...?

Because it’s there.

Wait a second Bill, why is John like that?
BILL
Because John is like that.
KIPP
Yeah, but Bill, what is the sound of one hand clapping?
BILL (to laughter)r
I’ve heard this one before...
He took a long time mulling over this, trying various answers: “it’s nonexistent,” “there is no sound,”
etc. Kipp repeated the prompts for the fl oor and the ceiling, and then returning to the sound of one
hand clapping.
BILL (to laughter)r
It can’t manifest a sound. It must have something to do with the fl oor and the ceiling.
KIPP
Human beings love logic. It’s all got to be logical. Right? What is the sound of one hand clap-
ping?
BILL
There is no sound.
KIPP
Where you are looking there is no sound. But the sound of one hand clapping is what? It’s 
simply what?

SPEAKING BEING
BILL
Simply, it’s nonexistent.
KIPP
Or: The fl oor is down there because...
BILL
There’s no “because” to the fl oor being down there.
KIPP
The fl oor is down there because...
BILL
There’s no reason for it to be down there.
KIPP
And the fl oor is down there because...
BILL (laughing)
It doesn’t have a because. Because somebody built it and stuck it there.
KIPP
The fl oor is down there because...
BILL
I shouldn’t have volunteered to continue with this. I seem to be losing it.
KIPP
That’s fi ne. That’s the diff erence between a distinction and a defi nition. You can’t get a distinc-
tion by defi ning it, or exampling it; you can only get it by creating it... So the fl oor is down there
because... Okay, forget about the fl oor, but the ceiling’s up there because...
BILL (looking up)
Because it’s there.
KIPP
Where? Up there, right? The ceiling’s up there because it’s up there.
BILL
...because the ceiling’s up there. Is that correct?

Forum Day Four: Session Two

KIPP
I don’t know if it’s correct or not, but the ceiling’s up there because the ceiling is up there, isn’t 
it? And Ashley is the way that Ashley is, and the fl oor is down there because the fl oor is down
there, and the ceiling is up there because the ceiling is up there, and the sound of one hand 
clapping is... What’s the sound of one hand clapping?
BILL
There is no sound.
KIPP
That’s one interpretation. What’s another one?
BILL
It doesn’t make any sense.
KIPP
Right. And what does make sense is your reasons. Choice doesn’t make sense. It just is. So the
sound of one hand clapping is...
(Bill swings his left hand back and forth)
What is that?
BILL (to applause and laughter)r
It’s the sound of one hand clapping.
KIPP
They got it, but I don’t know if you got it. The sound of one hand clapping is the...
BILL (smiling and to applause)
Sound of one hand clapping.
KIPP 
The sound of one hand clapping is always the sound of one hand clapping, isn’t it? 
BILL
Right.
KIPP
You cannot answer what they call in Zen a koan—a little riddle given by a Zen master to someone
studying Zen—you cannot answer that koan in your mind. You’ve got to be out of your mind.

And all you’ve had so far to operate from in life is your mind. All you’ve had is your reasons, 
your thoughts, your feelings, your considerations, for action. It’s all you’ve been given by hu-
man being to do something: You’ve had to decide and have a reason for your actions. But as you 
have demonstrated for us, we can distinguish that choice is based on what? It’s based on...
BILL
Your choice.
KIPP
Exactly. It’s simply your choice. Now which is more risky? A decision or a choice?
BILL
Choice.
KIPP
Exactly. Because as long as you have your reasons, if it doesn’t go well, if it goes a way it
shouldn’t have gone, you can always say “See, it didn’t work out! Why?” That’s why people get 
married. “Let’s see. I’ll get married because you’re nice looking, and we get along, and you want
to live in the same city I do, and all that other stuff , and then, when something happens and
the reasons for doing something stop being present in your life, well then, you question your 
marriage, because your marriage isn’t based on you, you never got married. What got married
was your reasons. That’s not called a marriage, that’s called an entanglement. You see, you’ve
never chosen to work where you work. You wonder why you have no power where you work?
Because you’re not there. What’s got you there are your reasons. No power here, just force: just
trying to move around the reasons.
(to Bill)
Bill, you did an extraordinary job. And why you did an extraordinary job is because you were
absolutely authentic about it.
BILL
Thank you.
KIPP
Why I appreciate it and why everyone in the room appreciates it is because you never stopped
looking and inquiring. Most people, when they don’t see it right away...
(referring to the quote Erhard read from On the Way to Language)
Heidegger says that the kind of beings that human beings are, we’re born thinking that we 
comprehend everything, you know, everything is comprehendible. And so if something 
is not comprehendible, the best we can do is be off ended by it. We’re off ended by what we

don’t comprehend versus being willing to think. In order to create that distinction, Bill, and 
if you were sitting in your chair doing the demonstration, you had to think. It wasn’t given by 
thoughts; you had to really think. So I’m asking you to start thinking that thinking and distin-
guishing are synonymous—not perfectly, not neatly. But you have to think to get a distinction,
to bring forth distinction.
(to Bill)
And that’s what you were willing to do. And you were big about it. And we appreciate it.
Bill returned to his seat as the group applauded. Another participant, Joan, raised her hand and
stood.
JOAN
I feel really stupid. I didn’t get it.
KIPP
Okay. What didn’t you get?
JOAN (in tears)
I don’t understand how to make a choice without a reason. 
KIPP
The reasons are still there, aren’t they? They don’t go away.
JOAN
No they don’t. I have a zillion of them.
KIPP
What’s a current choice you need to make?
JOAN
Figuring out what I want to do with my life. It sounds really stupid. What I want to do for a job.
KIPP
Okay. “What I want to do for a job.” You have a couple diff erent ideas?
JOAN
Yes.
KIPP
Okay good. What are the ideas?

JOAN
Start my own business.
KIPP
Okay.
JOAN
Or work for a small company.
KIPP
Let’s take those two for an example, Okay? Start your own business, work for a small company: 
choose!
JOAN (laughing)
Start my own company.
KIPP
Perfect! Now why are you going to start your own company? “I’m going to start my own compa-
ny because...”
JOAN
Because my father did.
KIPP
Perfect reason! That’s an example of a decision. What has you now starting your own company 
is your father did that: That’s not you making a choice, is it? It’s your father, so if it doesn’t work
out, you can kick the shit out of your father.
(laughter)r
Decisions get you off  the hook, don’t they? Because the reason “because my father did” has you 
starting your own company, not you. When you make a choice, you’re the chooser. You can 
still have all the thoughts; you can still carefully consider it all. I’m not saying to throw out the 
analysis. But if what you do is based on your analysis, I promise you a future determined by 
the past. Because analysis is always looking where? What’s already happened! And so far, that’s 
where you look in your life. You go:
(contorting his body to look behind him)
“Let’s see what’s possible in my life.”

KIPP (to the group)
And everything we’re starting to distinguish—you didn’t come equipped with this. You’ve got
to invent it. We’re beginning to invent a body of distinctions beyond what you got when you
became a human being. You’re not used to this; it’s going to take real thinking. This is what 
Einstein was talking about: The problems that we’ve got are not going to be solved at the level of 
thinking that created them. What’s required is a new level of thinking. Choice requires thinking. 
(to Joan)
Start your own business or work for a small company: choose!
JOAN
Start my own business.
KIPP
Great! And why did you make that choice? “I’m going to start my own company because...”
JOAN
...because if I don’t do it in my life, I’m going to be really disappointed.
KIPP
Perfect decision! The reason “because I’ll really be disappointed”—that’s what’s getting you
going again, that reason. Choice isn’t based on that, it’s to select freely: You are the chooser. You 
simply choose because you choose. You can still look at all that stuff . Look at this part of it and 
that part of it, but when it comes to a choice it’s you choosing. Ready? Start your own business,
work for a small company: choose!
JOAN
I choose starting my own company because it’s what I want to do.
KIPP
That’s a wonderful want.
JOAN
Because I think I should do it.
KIPP
And your wants and shoulds, which are totally a product of your past, now have you starting 
your own small business and what you’re going to be given—see the important thing is—if 
that’s what gets her into that game, she’s going to have whatever she’s got from her past. Every-
thing she needs for that is going to be given by the past because she’s not there starting her own 
small business; it’s the past starting her own small business, and she’ll have whatever power,
ability, excellence, and all that other stuff  she’s got from her past, and not “you,” because you

haven’t started your own business yet; the past is: all the reasons for doing it, right? Now, start 
your own business, work for a small company: choose!
JOAN
Start my own company.
KIPP
Good. Now why are you going to start your own company?
JOAN
Because it sounds like fun.
KIPP
Good. Then when it’s not fun, you’re going to go: “Well, this really wasn’t fun! I really thought 
it was going to be fun, but now it’s not, so now I’m not going to do it anymore.” Do you under-
stand? Are you hearing your own reasons?
JOAN
Here are my reasons...
KIPP
By the way, they aren’t even your reasons. They are reasons given to you by being human.
JOAN
Does choosing have anything to do with looking forward with nothing out there and not look-
ing behind you?
KIPP (now face-to-face with Joan)
It’s got to do with you saying so. You being the chooser. When you make a choice, you’re the
chooser. When you make a decision, the reasons are doing the deciding, not you. 
JOAN
Okay.
KIPP
Start your own business, work for a small company: choose!
JOAN
I’ll choose working for a small company.
KIPP
Okay. Fine. And why are you going to do that? Neither one is better than the other. That’s fi ne. 
We’re just distinguishing choice. “I choose to work for a small company because...”

JOAN
Because I’m into suff ering.
KIPP
Okay good! Can you hear that that’s a decision?
JOAN
Yeah.
KIPP
And it’s a decision because the reason “I’m into suff ering” is doing the selecting, not you. You’re 
the chooser. When you make a choice it’s based on nothing except you saying so. You are the
chooser. This is why it’s so diffi  cult, because your entire life has been used to reduce the risk.
Choice is going to put you fully into risk. You make the choice, you’re at risk, with no back door. 
Start your own business, work for a small company: choose!
JOAN
My own company.
KIPP
Good. “I choose to start my own company because...”
JOAN (to applause)
Because I chose it.
KIPP
Because you choose it, yeah. And she messed up a little bit because she said she “chose” it. 
Choice is never in the past. It’s only right now and right now and right now and right now. And 
you wonder why the aliveness, the enthusiasm, the possibility starts disappearing from those 
choices you’ve made in your life, it’s because you’ve stopped choosing. See you chose once...
(brushing hands together)r
“I chose fi fteen years ago! What do you want?” No, a choice is right now and right now and
right now and right now. Risky, huh?
JOAN
Yeah, that’s what I’ve been looking at the whole four days here, is that risk.

KIPP
Which risk?
JOAN
Choosing. Choosing to be out there.
KIPP
Right. That is the risk. That’s what everybody here is up against. Nobody here is interested in liv-
ing their lives; they are very interested in having their reasons design their life—their thoughts,
their feelings, their considerations, not them, “not me! Then I couldn’t complain!” See, if you 
choose, you can’t complain. It’s what everybody in here is up against. And what it is to be a
human being is to avoid responsibility. You cannot make somebody else responsible. You’ve 
already tried doing that. You can’t even make yourself responsible. You can only choose to be
responsible. But we haven’t distinguished responsibility yet. Choice equals freedom because it’s 
you choosing, not some reason.  I didn’t say reasons were bad. They just don’t give you: you!
JOAN
I got it.
KIPP
Thanks for staying with it.
Another participant stood.
ROSS
Somewhere along the line I got stuck in that you have to choose yes, and that if you choose no, 
it’s not a real choice.
KIPP
No, no, no, they are both the same. A choice is a choice. So “I choose no because I choose no.”
ROSS
Whenever I’m presented with a choice...
KIPP
Notice how you said that: as if it is an edict. “Whenever I’m presented with a choice, at all times...”
ROSS
Sometimes when I am presented with a choice, I choose yes because, who would say no?
KIPP
But that’s not a choice then. That’s the reason: “Why would somebody say no?” That’s a deci-
sion, not a choice. A choice is a choice. You choosing for no reason, simply because you say so.

ROSS
I had this distinction of choice at some point, and then I made a choice called “no” when I
really wanted to say “yes,” and now I can’t say no anymore. So when faced with big things, real 
choices, I say yes, and then look around and say “what did I get myself into?”
KIPP
Consider that you lost the distinction “choice.” It got folded back into reasons and thoughts
and feelings. What’s going to empower you in the matter is to work with this choice business,
to actually see: “Oh I see, choice is simply a choice. Me choosing. I choose whatever because I 
choose whatever. You stopped being the chooser. You called a decision a choice and got them
muddled up again.
ROSS (hesitant)
Yeah...
At this point Wes rejoined the conversation.
WES
We’re not saying choice is right. We’re saying choice is choice. We’re not saying decision is 
wrong. We’re saying decision is decision. They’re diff erent games. You don’t want to play one 
game and call it the other. That’s pretty silly. Mixing them up is like dressing up to play football
and then walking out onto the baseball fi eld, and the pitcher throws the ball to the catcher and
you tackle the catcher. 
(laughter)r
Does that look like your life Ross?
ROSS
Exactly. I really got that because sometimes the circumstances are really overwhelming and I
give into them, and instead of saying that I gave in to the circumstances and made a decision, I 
say “Oh, I chose that.”
WES
You should decide when deciding is the game you want to play and be responsible for the pro-
cess called decision. Choosing is distinguishing a way of being with life. And there are appropri-
ate times for deciding.
ROSS
Or at least be clear when you decided or when you chose. At least you’re on the right ball fi eld 
and can play that game.
WES
In your game—you’re a physician, right?—you better make decisions.

ROSS
Sure. Lidocaine, epinephrine...
WES (to laughter)r
Well, “I did the operation because I chose to.” You get in a lot of trouble that way. That’s not
responsible. Choice puts you into a certain relationship to life like “responsible for.” It shifts your 
relationship to what is. So now we need to do the real choice demo, right? So, all that stuff  we did? 
That wasn’t it. We’re close. We did the “getting up to this place” choice demonstration. We haven’t 
done the real one yet. There’s an illusion in the one we just did, which we are going to handle.
KIPP 
So we want to distinguish choice as choice. Okay, ready?
(holding out one hand to a participant, Andy)
Chocolate. Choose.
ANDY
Chocolate.
KIPP
Chocolate: How come you chose chocolate?
ANDY
Because I chose chocolate.
KIPP
Yeah. And what else was there?
ANDY
No choice at all...
KIPP
Was there anything else other than chocolate?
ANDY
Yes.
KIPP
Where? Chocolate: choose!
ANDY
I choose chocolate.

Forum Day Four: Session Two

KIPP
Yeah. Was there anything else?
ANDY
There was a choice not to choose chocolate.
KIPP
Where was the “not choose chocolate”? Chocolate: choose! Where did you get the “not choice”?
There was no “not choice.” Chocolate: choose!
ANDY
I choose chocolate.
KIPP
Right and that’s all that was there, right?
(laughter)r
Don’t you think that choice is selecting options?
ANDY
Yes.
KIPP
When you come down to it, you are that choice is selecting options. Choice is not selecting options. 
Choice is choosing what you’ve got. Chocolate: choose! And you go “Where’s the strawberry?” 
(laughter)r
What strawberry? What “not choice”? What vanilla? Chocolate: choose! This business called 
being? There’s no such thing as being in here.
(pointing to his chest
(
)
Being is giving being. What is giving being? Giving being is very much like choosing chocolate
when what you’ve got is chocolate. And it’s operationally true that whatever you can grant be-
ing to, allows you to be. It works in operation that whatever you can grant being to, allows you
to be. What happened? Chocolate: choose! Can you grant being, can you choose chocolate? Life 
is presenting you, moment by moment by moment by moment everything that it presents you. 
And what do you keep doing? Well, “not that! Not that! Not that! Not that!” And the moment
you say “Not that!” The moment you don’t choose: no being. Being is granting, or giving, being. 
And granting or giving being is very much like choosing chocolate when what you’ve got is
chocolate. What’s the diff erence between the ordinary quarterback and an extraordinary quar-
terback? They both do the same things: The ordinary quarterback goes to the sidelines and talks 
to the coach about what the defense is going to run. They walk out on the fi eld...

(grabbing a dictionary from the podium)
The ordinary quarterback walks out on the fi eld and goes “Ready! Hike!” And the defense 
doesn’t do what he thought it was going to do. So the ordinary quarterback goes “Ready! Hike!”
(Throwing the dictionary down on the ground and walks away from it, to laughter and applause, 
and then walks back and snatches up the dictionary)
The extraordinary quarterback goes to the sidelines and talks to the coach about what the defense 
is going to run. The extraordinary quarterback walks out on the fi eld and goes “Ready! Hike!” 
And when the defense doesn’t do what he thought it was going to do, he steps back into the 
pocket and gets the ball down the fi eld. He’s not waiting for life to be any other way than it is. He
chooses whatever’s happening as it’s happening. He can be with life. That’s choice. Choice is be-
ing with whatever is there, whatever life presents you with. The fi rst thing you’ve got to be willing 
to be with is your own racket. It’s taken you three days of hard work to be with the racket you’ve
got. Pretty powerful. I’ve had the privilege of leading The Forum when—at this point—a gentle-
man in a wheelchair came forward and took the microphone and said “Cerebral Palsy: choose!”
Or in a Forum for prisoners, where someone comes up and says “Jackson Prison: choose!” 
Because at that moment they stop serving time and time starts serving them, because they choose
what they’ve got. Are you willing to choose what you’ve got? I didn’t say succumb. I didn’t say 
submit. I said choose. Grant being. Give being like “chocolate: choose!” So far in life you’ve been
trained to—“Chocolate: choose!” “No! What the hell are you giving me this chocolate for?!”
(laughter)r
“Why do I have to be fat? That person’s racket is that they’re lonely. Why can’t I have lonely as a 
racket?”
(laughter)r
What’s going to have you be powerful in life is your choosing moment to moment. Choice isn’t 
selecting options. It’s granting being, giving being and granting being is very much like choos-
ing chocolate when what you’ve got is chocolate. The moment you can be with it, something
opens up. Andy, thank you very much for that work.
(Andy sits to applause
(
)
In a moment we’re going to go on a meal break. During the meal break, I’m asking you to con-
tinue to inquire into this distinction of choice, and to see how much you’re willing to choose. So
far in life you’ve got this little teeny-weeny opening for yourself. You know, if you say that and
they say that; and life acts like that and it doesn’t act like that, “that I’m willing to grant being
to.” See, what the rest of your life is going to be about is, if you take this on, what mastery is 
about, is simply opening up and opening up and opening up and opening up what you’re will-
ing to be with. When you’re only willing to be with a tiny part of life, you’ll only have a tiny life.
Be willing to open up with what you’re willing to open up to, to be with. It’s easy in here, and
when you go out there it isn’t so easy. You’ll be sitting there, choosing, and someone across from
you will be eating with their mouth open and you’ll want to stick a fork in their forehead.

Because you can’t choose mouth open with food in it. “Not that! No, not that!” You’ve got no
mastery yet. You’ve got no muscles for living your life yet. You’ve got a lot of muscles for per-
sisting and a lot of muscles for surviving, but no muscles for living, and the rest of the Forum 
is committed to bringing forth a body of distinctions to give you those muscles. To begin to: It’s
not over in just four days. You’re not going to get a PhD in four days. It’s a beginning. A break-
through. An opening. I’m inviting you during the meal break to inquire into this distinction
choice. To notice what you’re willing to choose and mostly what you are not willing to choose.
Not like you’re bad, not like you’re wrong: just like you’ve cut out most of life for yourself. So far
your life has had to be consistent with your racket and that’s all that’s been available to you. I’m
inviting you to open that up for yourself.
Kipp announced that an opportunity to register into the seminar would occur after the meal break. 
The Forum supervisor announced a dinner break at 4:35 pm, and that The Forum would begin again

The Forgetting of Being, Part Eight of Eight: The Heart of 
the Matter
A significant moment in the development of Western thinking, for Martin Heidegger, 
was that point in ancient Greek history that he calls the “the inceptive end of the 
great inception” (IM 200). The great inception was the new possibility for Being-
in-the-world that emerged in the thinking of the pre-Socratics; and this possibility 
reached its end with Plato. The end of a great possibility, however, does not occur as 
the culmination of a decline: 
The great begins great, sustains itself only through the free 
recurrence of greatness, and if it is great, also comes to an 
end in greatness. So it is with the philosophy of the Greeks. 
It came to an end in greatness with Aristotle. (IM 17)
This process, which Heidegger calls “the play of Being,” has proceeded in such a way 
that “this ‘inception’ also covered up the inceptive inception” (IM 200). This is why 
current students of Western philosophy begin their studies with Plato and Aristotle: 
the great inception of the pre-Socratics has been subsumed by the metaphysical 
tradition of Western thinking, which has demonstrated its own greatness, and has 
created the circumstances of its own end.
Plato’s role in this development lay in his reinterpretation of physis—which for 
the pre-Socratics was the self-blossoming emergence of beings into the world—as 
eidos, or idea. Here Heidegger suggests the implications of this move:  
We can easily assess the distance between the two intepre-
tations if we pay attention to the diff erence between the 
perspectives in which these essential determinations of 
Being, physis and idea, move. Physis is the emerging sway, 
the standing-there-in-itself, constancy. Idea, the look as 
what is seen, is a determination of the constant insofar as, 
and only insofar as, it stands opposed to a seeing. (IM 203, 
emphasis added) 
For Platonic thinking, then, the term idea had quite specific implications: “The word idea 
means what is seen in the visible, the view that something offers. What is offered is the 
current look or eidos of whatever we encounter” (IM 201).  Emergence has been captured 
in appearance.
“ 
SESSION TWO INTERVAL
As this development has played itself out, therefore, the visible and substantial 
outcome of unconcealment (i.e., the being that is unconcealed) has come to sub-
sume in understanding the process by and through which that being has emerged. 
Idea, the “whatness” of beings, becomes the definitive interpretation of Being. Even-
tually, when Greek terms were translated into Latin by the Romans, physis became 
natura. Nature, the manifestation of physis which is most visible and accessible to 
us, in time came to represent Being.
Being was thereby enshrined in language as beings. But an element has gone 
missing in that enshrinement, says Heidegger, since “to be the Being of beings is the 
matter of Being” (EGT 50). Thus a puzzle arose, a puzzle in the languaging of Be-ing; 
and the puzzle lay in the unobtrusive but critical word “of”: 
The grammatical form of this enigmatic, ambiguous gen-
itive [“of”] indicates a genesis, the emergence of what is 
present from presencing. Yet the essence of this emergence 
remains concealed along with the essence of these two 
words [“Being” and “beings”]. Not only that, but the very 
relation between presencing and what is present remains 
unthought. (EGT 50)
The thinking of both Heidegger and Werner Erhard is designed to distinguish this 
relation between Being and beings, and to retrieve this relation from oblivion. 
Subsequent to the oblivion of this relation, the question of Being, now under-
stood as a higher being, had to look beyond other beings in an attempt to find its 
subject. For the Greeks, the tradition which placed Being beyond nature became 
meta ta physika. Furthermore, this metaphysical separation of essence from exis-
tence was set firmly in place for the Western tradition by the thinking of Plato:
...Being as idea was elevated to a suprasensory realm. 
The chasm, khorismos, was torn open between the merely 
apparent beings here below and the real Being somewhere 
up there. Christian doctrine then established itself in this 
chasm, while at the same time reinterpreting the Below 
as the created and the Above as the creator [. . .]. And so 
Nietzsche is right to say that Christianity is Platonism for 
the people. (IM 116)
We are approaching the heart of the matter with regard to the question which has 
generated this inquiry: Why does the transformational experience that is made available 
in The Forum occur as elusive, evasive, as a get-it-and-lose-it phenomenon? 
“ 
“ 
“ 


=== END OF PAGE 462 ===

=== PAGE 463 ===

Forum Day Four: Session Two Interval 449
It is the authors’ policy, consistent with the thinking we are exploring, to allow 
questions to remain open, and if possible to open them further. We therefore pro-
pose this response that opens up a new line of inquiry: it is the nature of Being to 
withdraw. 
[T]his concealing of its essence and of its essential origin is 
characteristic of Being’ s primordial self-illumination. . . . 
The being itself does not step into this light of Being. The 
unconcealment of beings, the brightness granted them, 
obscures the light of Being. As it reveals itself in beings, 
Being withdraws. [. . .] Man’s inability to see himself corre-
sponds to the self-concealing of the lighting of Being. (EGT 
26, emphasis added)
Being is always the context of meaninglessness from which the meanings have 
emerged, the everything/nothing of the sway from which the Greeks struggled to 
bring forth beings. Not-Being is Being’s flipside, and must remain its persistent ori-
entation, as Heidegger finds in this passage from the pre-Socratic thinker Heraclitus 
(Fragment 123): 
Physis kryptesthai philei: Being [emerging appearance] in-
trinsically inclines toward self-concealment. Being means: 
to appear in emerging, to step forth out of concealment—
and for this very reason, concealment and the provenance 
from concealment essentially belong to Being. Such prove-
nance lies in the essence of Being, of what appears as such. 
Being remains inclined toward concealment, whether in 
great veiling and silence, or in the most superficial distort-
ing and obscuring. (IM 126, emphases added)
It is essential to recognize, then, that the emergence of physis into the world, and 
the unconcealment of Being’s truth that is manifested in such emergence, is never a 
once-and-for-all event. 
It is the power of logos to hold together what tends apart, maintaining the 
oppositional tendencies of that which it gathers in “the highest acuteness of its ten-
sion” (IM 149). But this is not achieved without human participation in the struggle: 
“Where struggle ceases, beings indeed do not disappear, but world turns away” 
(IM 68, emphases added).
The mystery of Being, for the fortunate among us, may cease for a moment to 
be a mystery. That moment may be a minute, a month, or even a year. But inevita-
“ 
“ 
bly the mystery becomes again a mystery, a puzzlement. Finding one’s way back 
into the heart of the mystery is the adventure of emergence returning to conceal-
ment and emerging and returning to concealment. It is the ongoing challenge of 
transformation.

When The Forum resumed at 6:35 pm, following the dinner break, Wes and Kipp were on the 
platform. Kipp began the session requesting that participants share what they had seen about 
“choice.” The fi rst to respond was Mac, the man in a wheelchair who had previously complained on 
the morning of Day Two about the late ending time of the fi rst day. 
MAC 
You’ll have to indulge me because I have a need to thank your organization for going out of 
their way for me. It was generous. It was done with love and caring. Good stuff .
KIPP
You’re worth it.
MAC
Thanks.
KIPP
Thank you very much.
(applause)
MAC
I also have a need to share with you a progression. I came here and some of you remember that 
I was kind of angry. The fi rst thing I said was “Goddamn it, what the hell are you keeping us up 
for, to one o’clock, we need our sleep.” Someone I was carpooling with asked what I thought, and 
I said, “Werner Erhard: He’s an asshole.” That’s how I started this. A lot of anger. The next day 
they asked me, and I said, “You know, he’s not bad.” Today I am convinced he is a genius. And 
all you guys really know your stuff , and really care about people, how to get the most for people. 
I want to thank you because it has made a big diff erence in my life. I thought I knew a lot of 
stuff , and I really don’t. I’ve discovered it doesn’t matter that I don’t know very much. What the 
hell’s the diff erence? What is, is. That’s what I’ve discovered here today. I was having dinner and 
someone asked what are we going to tell people what we got out of this and what it is all about? 
We’ll tell them “Why don’t you go and experience it. It’s a hell of an experience. Period.” Because 
I don’t know how to describe in words what has happened to me.
KIPP
You are in the sharing of yourself. Your sharing is the opening for action for people. 
MAC
I get it.
KIPP
See, when you share like you just shared, Mac, people want to participate. Whatever opened up 
for you in your life, the way you said it, is consistent with who people are. You just share your self.

That is what we plan to do. And other issues have come up. For example, I told my wife, “You 
know, we have a lot of tension around getting lost here in the Bay Area.” And we’ve gotten lost 
a lot! You know, getting lost is like a way of life for us! So who I’m going to be the next time we 
get lost, is lost. I’m going to let myself be lost and enjoy some new lost area!
(applause)
It’s genuine. It’s how I’m going to live! I’m amazed at the diff erence this is in my life! And how 
did I get here? I’ve resisted this for something like ten years. I belong to a men’s group. Six of us. 
Very intimate. Met twice a month. Five were involved with your program. I was not. I fought it. 
I didn’t need it and I thought it was a bunch of shit. Okay? About six months ago my son called 
me. He said “Dad, you know what? I just experienced something. I was at a Forum and I think 
you ought to go.” I paused and listened to him. I was still resisting. And then he went and did 
other programs and kept saying simply, “Dad, I think you ought to go.” And now I am going to 
call him to thank him for the wonderful gift he has given me.
(long applause with many people standing)
KIPP
Thank you very much. What occurred to me when you were standing, acknowledging Mac, 
you know, what brings tears to your eyes is being in the presence of your own magnifi cence. 
As Mac spoke, what he opened up for you is being in the presence of your magnifi cence. He 
was astounding as he is in his speaking and his generosity, but what’s present in the room is 
who you are. And by the way, if you’re not that way right now—some of you are at the other 
level of the roller coaster and you think you should be where the other people are standing and 
cheering for Mac—don’t get sucked into that. Wherever you are is where you are. 
WES
The other thing you want to get is how shitty you were before The Forum. 
(laughter)
It might be useful for you to confront what you were like for those people who shared The Forum 
with you, and who you were like for others in your life. Regardless of whether they shared with 
you skillfully or not, they were committed to something. And that’s a lot more than most people 
are up to. And you couldn’t help but be in the presence of the work when Mac shared. This is a big 
person, and you remember he and I had that conversation about the ending time the other day. 
Same person. And this is who Mac is now. I had to confront the same thing when I did The Forum. 
I’m inviting you to confront it: who you have been for other people and who you can be. And as 
you step out of The Forum into your life... you know, I know that Mac will share The Forum with 
people, and he’ll do it as well as he does, and he’ll learn and he’ll do it better—sounds pretty good 
right now—and no matter how great Mac will be, there will be people unwilling to get what he’s 
really committed to, who will turn it into something. And the question will be whether Mac will 
stop being committed to whatever he’s committed to in sharing The Forum, or will he continue on 
in the face of that.

Kipp asked participants to raise hands to indicate how many guests (who had invited the current 
participants to take The Forum) were coming at 9 pm, so that enough chairs could be set up to 
accommodate them.
MAUREEN
When you said, “Chocolate: choose!” I started to cry, because I have this big trauma drama that 
has taken me forever to get over, that if I told it to you, I could make you cry, and I could write a 
whole soap opera about my childhood, I mean it is so good, right? And it always felt like I never 
had a choice, and I worked through that stuff , and I could never like really be with it, and it was 
like when you said “chocolate: choose!” I had that choice to choose it, and I didn’t, I resisted it, I 
made people wrong, and ran my rackets on them, did a lot of crazy stuff , and I just sat back there 
and cried because I got that you said that for me. You gave me a gift. Thank you for giving me that.
KIPP
You’re welcome. Good work!
(applause)
The gift, the satisfaction, is in the creating of the distinctions. There was something inherently 
satisfying in the creating of the distinction, which gave her freedom. Like The Karate Kid, 
washing cars, waxing cars: wax on, wax off . Wax on, wax off  didn’t seem like freedom to the 
karate kid until he got out on the court and played, and he was left in the presence of karate. 
Coaching doesn’t look like what you think it should.
JORIE
I just came back from dinner and I was talking to my brother—he is also in The Forum—and 
I have been struggling with The Forum. I was grieving over the relationship with my parents, 
because I realized I didn’t really know them, with their stories and my stories. And my brother 
helped me. He said, at the same time I was grieving, instead of having to grieve, those times I 
was, I could have accepted the possibility that now I can be friends with them and just accept 
them, and fi nd out who they are instead of grieving about who they were, and being sad about 
all the stories that they have. And also, this is my fi rst time to share. This is just the beginning, 
like everybody said, and I cannot tell you how much freedom it has given me. Talking about 
choice and decision, in every part of my life, and especially my job. I just wanted to share that.

Sharing it empowers you. The more you share it and make it real for yourself, the more it’s you.

People who know me: I’m a very signifi cant guy. Very serious. I saw a racket of mine and how 
it ties in during the choice exercise I wanted to share with everybody. What I do with people is 
I make them authority fi gures. I don’t care who they are. Started off  with my fi rst wife. I made 
her the boss: She was a couple years older than me. That was easy. Then I made my second wife

the boss. She was eleven years younger than me. That was a little harder. It took longer but I 
turned her into an authority fi gure. And if you’re over twenty I’ll do that to you.
(laughter)
Somehow I’ll make you boss. If you’re under twenty, I’ll have an edge for a little while. I didn’t 
see the cost; didn’t see the racket very plainly until this Forum. And I saw that I did it at my job. 
Also, I own a company. I’ve got three other partners, and one isn’t even an equal partner, he’s 
got ten percent of the company. Two are younger than I am and I’ve turned them all into my 
bosses. I made one into the president and I call him the boss. I’ll do that. You can count on that. 
KIPP
It’s a great way to avoid the responsibility of your own power.
VINNY
Exactly, not to be dominated by my own power, and the cost is everywhere. But the choice, to 
choose, the ability to choose that that’s that: That’s my racket. And to choose that—there’s a 
tremendous freedom in that, tremendous possibility to actually not have to be run by the racket. 
So thank you.
KIPP
Thank you!
MONTY (to laughter)
Thanks for calling on me, fi nally! It’s my fi rst share! I did the training in ’78 and I didn’t share, 
a couple of seminars and I didn’t share. And when we were dealing with that fear thing the 
other night, I couldn’t see my fear, but there was sadness. That was the feeling I got up. And I 
get a lot of tears, through you and through everybody’s stories. But I can’t contact my fear. I’m 
up to being scared shitless. That’s why I got up here to share; I always fi nd a way not to. And I’m 
standing and it’s okay. Fear runs me. That’s my major racket. It makes it possible for me to be 
invisible; it’s okay to be invisible and not count. Every mealtime I go through a panic, who am I 
going to eat with? Am I going to be alone? Can I just walk off  into the city and avoid being with 
anybody? Everyone’s been so generous to me. People gave me a ride back home. I’ve met more 
people here in these days than I’ve met and been with. 
(choking up)
I’m overwhelmed. I don’t know what this thing’s about, but the people in this room are 
available to me. 
KIPP
That’s what it’s about. 
MONTY
I’m really getting that. And I’m so pissed off  that I’ve let myself be run by this fear thing, that I have 
to be alone with no friends. It’s all horseshit. And so choosing that is kind of a challenge for me.

Moment by moment by moment by moment choosing that. 
MONTY
Right. In and out of, and I’m sure, I get I’m real excited about what I’ve realized and then it’s 
gone.
KIPP 
You have no muscles in this area yet. You have teeny-weeny baby muscles in this area. What 
this work is about, what the seminar’s about is the Nautilus of Possibility. 
(laughter)
It’s true! You have no muscles for this. You cannot stay unhooked for more than fi ve minutes. 
Somebody who looks like your mother walks by, and you’re three years old: You’re gone! It’s not 
bad to be weak. It’s just stupid to lie about it if you are. That’s what’s been disempowering you. 
Not your weakness. It’s been your act of saying that you’re not. The moment you get to be weak, 
you can start building some muscle. It’s going to take everything you got in your life. You’ve got 
to have people around you that are more committed to you than you are. 
MONTY
That’s what it is. The people I’ve met here are more committed to me than I’ve ever been 
committed to myself in my whole life. 
KIPP
The conversation that comes with being a human being is not on your side. On my pillow in the 
morning, the conversation that’s never there—I never wake up into: “Why don’t you get up and 
jog?”
(laughter)
Never, it’s always a committee about how many times I’ve done it already this week, what the 
weather’s like, why I really shouldn’t today because I need my rest. It’s never on my side; it’s 
always telling me: “Slow down. What are you doing this to yourself for? No jogging. What you 
need to do for yourself is get up and go to the fridge, pull out that piece of chocolate cake you 
didn’t eat last night, bring it back to your bed, eat it in bed, and then sleep some more.” 
MONTY
It’s real easy for me to make, like you and Wes and Werner, and other people, like not... not be 
like that. And therefore...
KIPP
We’re not like that? That’s true. Yeah, you can be like us someday.

MONTY (to laughter)
I’m lost.
KIPP
Right. Yeah, it’s easy to make somebody else not be like that, therefore you can sell out. Because 
if somebody has some quality, like leadership, or ability, or talent, or whatever that is, and you 
don’t have that quality, that property, you get to say, “If I had that property, I would be great like 
them, but since I don’t, I won’t.”
MONTY
Yeah.
KIPP
I don’t mind the interpretation “leadership,” you know, if there’s this stuff  called leadership, 
except what I’ve noticed is, if you don’t have it, you’re out of luck. As long as there’s this stuff  
called leadership, or skill, or talent, or ability, you’ve got to get it somewhere.
MONTY
Well that’s what I came here for.
KIPP
Exactly, or if leadership is a conversation, you’ve got access to it, don’t you? You have access to a 
conversation?
MONTY
Yeah. 
KIPP
Exactly. So I’m inviting you to consider that leadership or whatever it is that you see that calls 
you to be is a conversation. And the conversation that you have been listening to is not worth 
your life. That’s the one you’ve been honoring. 
MONTY
Yeah. Good. Thanks.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 10)
When Werner was talking yesterday, or you were talking, and he talked about, if this work 
“calls” to you in some way... When I participated in this work for the fi rst time thirteen years 
ago, this work called to me. You know, I can remember sitting in that room in New York City, 
present to that this was somehow how I knew life could be, like a possibility, really. Whether I 
liked it or didn’t like it, or whether I felt like I belonged, or whether I felt like I didn’t belong, 
I was called to that. It spoke to me. So I said “yes” to whatever was in front of me, and I kept 
saying “yes,” and I kept saying “yes,” and I kept saying “yes.” And I’m left with a couple of 
things out of this Forum for myself, and one is that...you know, I lead The Forum almost

every weekend, like you do, and I’m never not brought to my knees, like knocked out, by 
what happens for people in The Forum, or really what The Forum is for people. And these 
four days, sitting in this chair, in diff erent parts of the room, I saw that I had no idea what the 
possibility of this Forum was, at all, in being a participant. Who walked in here four days ago 
was, you know, “Yeah” to what life brings. But who’s walking out four days later is “Yes!” to 
life. I don’t care what life brings me, I’m a “yes” to that. To be grateful, to be thankful, to be 
blessed... I don’t know what the words are for that, but to be “yes,” to be able to be a “yes” to 
life, that is the greatest gift. Thank you.
KIPP
Avril.
AVRIL
That’s what I wanted to talk about: choice.
KIPP
Good.
AVRIL
I defi nitely have my foot nailed to the fl oor in the area of choice. I’ve been trying to fi nd 
satisfaction in my marriage. I’ve kind of tried all kinds of things, hoping about it, creating it. I 
created it for about two weeks and that didn’t work. And about two years ago what I realized is 
that what I keep doing is trying to do all this stuff  on top of “no.” And so it’s like, “oh!...”
KIPP
The clearing that you are in life is “no.” That’s what you’re saying?
AVRIL
Yes. It’s like “no” has me. And all the other stuff  is on top of that. And so then I fi nally thought, 
“Okay, I got it. The choice is no!” So, I separated from my husband, and we’re both here to see 
what to do about our marriage. I’ve got all the reasons to get divorced and all the reasons why 
not to, and it seems like my choice is “no, I don’t want to be married.”
KIPP
These are two diff erent things. “My choice is no” and “I don’t want to be married” are distinct. 
One’s a decision and one’s a choice. 
AVRIL (weeping)
My choice is no, and I have this huge “should.”
KIPP
Yeah, that’s right.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 10, continuing)

Forum Day Four: Session Three 457
AVRIL
And I think that’s where I get mucked up, you know, the risk: The “should” is so huge that I 
keep getting back into the mud with it. 
KIPP
That’s why nobody wants choice. It leaves them being responsible. It’s much easier to be used 
by whatever life gives you. 
AVRIL
Where I feel confused is, when you say “take what you got.” What I got is my husband, so then I 
think that...
KIPP
You don’t have your husband.
AVRIL
I have this marriage, this entanglement.
KIPP
What you’ve got is this question about your marriage. That’s what you’ve got.
AVRIL
That’s what I need to choose.
KIPP
That’s what you’ve got right now, right? This question about your marriage.
AVRIL
Right. I feel like I’ve had that for twelve years.
KIPP
That’s your drama, though. You’re pretty dramatic about the whole thing. I’m not trying to 
reduce what it is to be married, to love somebody and not have it go according to your dreams, 
and what comes along with that, but we’ve had a pretty straight conversation for four days, and 
we can kind of cut the drama pretty easily now: to get on with your life. If you didn’t have this 
question, this entanglement, what would you get on with? What’s the big payoff  in your life for 
all these histrionics? 
AVRIL
I feel like I’ve gotten on with it in every other area of my life except this one, and the payoff  is 
that I don’t count, or rather, that’s the racket.

You getting on with every other area except this one is not getting on at all.
(holding out both hands like the vanilla or chocolate choosing exercise)
Marriage, no marriage, choose. Choose!
AVRIL
No marriage.
KIPP
Okay, now what are we going to do? That’s complete.
AVRIL
Yeah, okay. I was great when I had that...
KIPP
What do you mean when you have that? You just chose it!
AVRIL
Right, but then I thought, but somehow, he doesn’t mean, that’s not what they mean by choice, 
because that’s what I got two years ago. And I got lit up about it...
KIPP
But then you got sucked right back into it.
AVRIL
Right, and then my husband comes back with, “You’ve got the marriage you’ve got, so stick 
with it.” And we’ve been going around and around for two years.
KIPP
The whole question is what are you willing to be responsible for in your life? Isn’t that it? You 
don’t quite want to be responsible for it. 
(referring to Vinny)
It’s like, he doesn’t want to be responsible for his own power, so he turns everybody else into an 
authority fi gure. Nobody wants to be responsible. It doesn’t come with being a human being. So 
you have to go on with this crap about your marriage. You’re either going to be married to him or 
not. Both of you are going to die, be buried in a box and have dirt thrown on your face. What’s all 
the racket about? What being a human being is about is generating sympathy. You’re going to get 
everybody sucked into your sympathy. Sympathy is between shit and syphilis in the dictionary.

This will be on your gravestone: “I couldn’t quite fi gure out what to do enough,” right?
AVRIL
Right.
KIPP
Some of you might be listening, “Well, it’s all right to be divorced”; “It’s all right to be married”: 
It’s all the same. Simply choose and that leaves you responsible, and what goes along with that. 
Now the consequences for what you are doing don’t seem to be nurturing you. Yes?

Right.

My litmus test is always: What empowers you? What leaves you empowered?

PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 12)
I was walking outside and I turned to someone and I said, “Man that ‘problems’ talk was a 
bitch. I really had a lot of problems with going unconscious, it was really diffi  cult for me.” 
And she said “that’s because you make everything a problem.” And I said “What do you mean 
I make everything a problem?” And I saw right there that my response to some issue coming 
up, some problem is “this shouldn’t be. I don’t want this. This is crap.” And that’s the way I 
would literally be about anything unexpected or that I didn’t want to have happen, when I’m 
at home, I don’t want this. And what I saw in the choice distinction that I haven’t somehow 
had come together so I could see this: what it is a conversation. That’s all a problem is, is 
a conversation. There’s no problem out here. There’s only a conversation. It isn’t anything 
else. There’s no problem out here. It is a conversation. And what it means to choose it is to 
choose that conversation right there. So that conversation is called “I don’t want to be in that 
relationship right now.” Or if it’s a conversation called “My car!” or whatever the conversation 
is. I would have that conversation, whatever it was, with myself. And the problem would linger 
as a private personal conversation that I kept going on with myself. But I would never choose 
the conversation. I wouldn’t choose that private conversation. And what I saw was that in my 
relationship, or that in any problem, it’s that moment I choose that conversation right there and 
externalize that, get that out here in our relationship, make it public. 
KIPP (to the group)
Watch out for listening to this like a formula, or for the seven easy steps for relating. It’s a 
distinction he’s sharing.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 12)
Yes. And that’s what there is to choose, not what’s out there but what is right here, and to 
communicate what’s right here. All of a sudden I got freedom, I had release, I was awake again. 
It wasn’t something I couldn’t do. “Choose that” had always been to me: “submit to it,” or “give 
in to it,” or “suppress what you don’t like about it.” That’s what choice was about. Rather than, 
“If I’m having a conversation called ‘I don’t like that,’ choose that conversation ‘I don’t like

that.’” And if it’s appropriate you communicate that, and that has the thing moving. And the 
other thing I saw about problems is, just like you said, it’s stuck, it’s not moving, and when the 
conversation is out here, it’s moving then, and it begins to work its way through whatever’s 
stuck.
KIPP (to the group)
What you want to notice here is that even if you don’t quite understand what he is saying, you 
can be with him distinguishing something. What’s enlivening is this business of learning and 
growing. That’s what’s attractive to you, it’s his life that he’s inquiring into here. The guy’s so 
turned on he can barely stand it. 
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 12)
That’s the last thing I want to say. I’ve been doing this for a long time...
KIPP
That’s why this Forum is special. You’ve got the old timers in this room. You fi nd out what it’s 
like to live this stuff  for seventeen years. Doesn’t get less. Not like something you did seventeen 
years ago.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 12)
I remember when I read Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind. The biggest pitfall is that you think 
you know Zen, is that you “got it.” There was a part of this Forum when I was listening, 
“yeah I got that.” And then there was another moment when I saw that I’d had the 
conversation fifty times and a lot of people have gotten value out of that, but my life sucks 
in that area. I’m so good at working with all these people making a difference, but what 
about me and problems? 
KIPP
That’s the diff erence between leading The Forum and being The Forum.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 12)
Exactly. And all of a sudden, at that moment, I got all excited about The Forum and the work, 
and participating in it again, and learning, and growing and it was all brand-new for me.
KIPP
Thank you.

It’s going to take everything you’ve got to be unreasonable with yourself to keep it opened up. 
WANDA (whose mother is also a participant in The Forum) 
I completed my relationship with my mother, I’m thrilled to say, and I actually didn’t think 
that I needed to. But then yesterday when someone was sharing, I just started to cry a lot, and I 
didn’t know what she had just said that made me cry.

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
She said what she said. You cried. She did not make you cry.
WANDA
All right. What I did notice was I didn’t want her to see me crying. What I saw was two things 
my mother said to me as a little girl that had been driving my life. She said that the way to make 
her happy was that she’d be happy if I was happy. 
KIPP
A lot of you withhold that from your parents. A lot of you don’t want to be well, alive, happy: 
You’ve got to keep being a little bit screwed up so that they’re not quite sure they did it all right. 
WANDA
The second thing she said about how to make her happy was that whatever I did was that I 
would do my best, be the best that I could be. I saw early on that I could not deliver on the fi rst 
point, I couldn’t make her happy by me being happy because growing up, my mother was beat 
up a lot and I was miserable in that situation. I was telling her this whole thing over dinner 
and she didn’t want to hear that part. It was too painful. It brought up that I wasn’t supposed 
to share all of the sadness that I had. I was only allowed to share the good things. So I made 
that decision that I couldn’t deliver on that promise. I did deliver on the arrangement that I 
would be the best I could be at what I chose to be. I went on to gather a lot of credentials and 
accomplishments, so that my mother would be happy. I told her that I have been living her 
life for her because she also told me when I was little that she had her artwork as a teenager 
featured in the Brussels World Fair and I said “Why didn’t you pursue that?” She said, “I went 
to career day and went into the room for commercial artists and it was all men.” And the man 
leading the event said to her that she had the wrong room. “The typing room is down the hall.”
KIPP
You all got sucked into that one. That’s how much strength you’ve got. One little thing and you 
go...
(to laughter, Kipp imitates again a runt trying to break into the litter to feed from) 
WANDA
When she had shared that with me, that she didn’t get to pursue her career I made a decision 
that I would for her. I’ve been living her life for her. I would carry that torch...
KIPP
It’s not a torch; it’s an anvil around your neck. 
WANDA (to laughter)
Right. Right. And then I asked her why she didn’t pursue it later and she said, “Well, I got 
married and had sixteen children.”

(laughter)
KIPP (to the group)
Are you starting to see how much room you have in life to be? Every conversation, you’re gone. 
You are a Velcro ball.
WANDA
I’m sharing this to see the decisions I’ve made and how they have run me. And what I decided 
at that point was to never allow my family to stop me in my career. I was sharing this with her 
during dinner and she said, “This is too painful, I don’t want to talk about this.” My point in 
sharing this is that without this Forum we wouldn’t have had the breakthrough we did have. At 
one point I fi nally said, “Mom, the only way you and I and the rest of the children will be freed 
is to talk about it like ‘that’s what’s so,’ rather than to suppress it.”
KIPP
Think back to the conversation we were just having a few minutes ago. In the real-life sense, 
these are the conversations he was talking about choosing, like those, the ones that are there to 
talk about. 
WANDA
So at that point she asked me for some coaching—she’d never asked for that before...
KIPP
You had not been available for that before. It’s not that she never asked you: You’ve never been 
there, available.
WANDA
So we started sharing about the experience. She acknowledged that the experience was 
painful for her. The first time she had ever acknowledged that and that it might have been 
painful for us as children growing up around that. She had not been willing to confront 
that with us.
KIPP (correcting her) 
She hadn’t said that. 
WANDA
Right. Well, I hadn’t been willing to confront it either... 
KIPP (correcting again, getting her out of the story into the what happened)
You hadn’t said that... 
WANDA
We did share it. It looked like what was coming across was that she didn’t do a good job. 


=== END OF PAGE 477 ===

=== PAGE 478 ===

464
SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
It looked like that’s what you were saying?
WANDA
Yeah. I was sitting across the table and I got up and went around and I said “Mom, I want 
you to know that all of the accomplishments are a result of the incredible support and love 
and training that you gave me in growing up and that anything that has not worked is a 
result of my racket, I am the source of all of that. You did a great job. We all turned out.” She 
had this great big smile on her face. I said “Being able to talk about this, we may be able to 
laugh about it now.” She said, “well, maybe.” We hugged and kissed. We went our separate 
ways but then ran into each other in the bathroom. She comes up to me and whispers in my 
ear, “Wanda, I want you to know that I am so proud of you, for all your accomplishments, 
even though it was kind of hard growing up, wasn’t it?” And she started to laugh. This kind 
of communication would never have occurred if it hadn’t been for The Forum. I now have a 
relationship with my mother I’ve never had before. And now I can open up with her and even 
share the rough times as well as the wonderful times.
KIPP (to the group) 
Get these things captured in your conversation. When you’re sharing this week, you will want 
to stop, because you’re not used to sharing. But people in your life are worth this conversation.
WANDA
Something else opened up out of this conversation. One of the things I’ve been struggling 
with today is my relationship to my manager, looking at some resistance I’ve had and all of 
a sudden realizing, as I walked in, this great sense of freedom, I’ve not been willing to let my 
manager manage me, to get close enough to me to manage me and coach me. I’ve been afraid 
of him discovering all this stuff  underneath what I’m hiding, all the things that I’ve had with 
my mom that I’ve carried around with me everywhere. An incredible opening and insight! 
KIPP
Thank you!

You need to see that you’re going to need that campaign to stamp out reasonableness in your 
life, to keep this happening in your life.
TRUMAN
Thank you for calling on me. Yesterday I had decided I wanted to share. And I didn’t get called 
on when I had my hand up, and then I was getting pissed off . I said, “Wait a minute. I’m

“...you’re supposed to call on me now. I’m ready!” I knew I had a black act but didn’t know I 
had such a chip on my shoulder. How I go about it is I get close to people and as soon as I get

I’ll dare them to do whatever...
(breaking out into extended laughter)
A lot of people I’ve worked with—I’ve not allowed them to support me. I never realized that I 
was just being my act about it. It never dawned on me that it was about being black and being 
right. How it occurred for me is that they didn’t really care about me; that they were out for 
their stuff . It wasn’t just who they are and who I am playing a game together. If I allowed in 
what this work does for people; that would destroy my racket. 
KIPP
And it would allow them to get the most out of you.

TRUMAN
Get the most out of me?
KIPP
Yeah. If this work gets the most out of people, it’ll get the most out of you.
TRUMAN (laughing)
Right, and I’m not interested in that.

I was sitting here. It was so funny. You were saying “Chocolate, choose.” And then it got funnier 
when I was thinking “Chocolate chip, choose.”

KIPP
You all understand that all people are doing is sharing? All that’s happening is that people are 
sharing. And you’re so excited; you’re peeing in your pants here. This is really more than you 
ever bargained for in life. You never thought you could be a big enough person so that you could 
hear people and let people this deeply into your lives. Thank you.
DARRELL
My whole act has been kind of being afraid of people, and then when I realized I got into the 
conversation and saw that everybody is about as afraid of me as I am of them—that was a 
bright light for me. I’ve been Mr. Aloof, sitting back like I know it all, and just wouldn’t talk to 
anybody. I’ll just sit here looking like I’m in deep thought with myself and everyone will leave

that. Now I feel stupid.

On my way down from Washington to do The Forum, the bus driver had heard of this work 
and he suggested to me that it was brainwashing and I shouldn’t do it. The fi rst day, I had that 
thought just a bit. I mean, brainwashing does happen. 
KIPP
Yes. Rub a dub dub. 
(laughter)
KAREN (becoming moved as she speaks)
Then I listened to the sharing, and I saw that if the work can call forth this kind of authenticity, 
and recognize that authenticity, then it’s got to be authentic. And it’s got to all be authentic. All 
of it. I want all of you who have stood up to share to get that it’s been such a huge contribution 
to see people having that kind of courage and willingness to step out and it really is profoundly 
moving to see people come up against pain and grief and fear and push through when they 
never thought they could, it’s extraordinary, and people are magnifi cent. I came to America to 
have adventures, and love and joy were not two things that were especially present in my life 
before coming here, and that’s what I got here.

I’ve been participating in this work since 1975—that’s about half my life—and this is the greatest 
thing I ever did... the fi rst minute I was in the original program I knew I’d never seen anything 
like this, and I knew I’d be around this for a long, long time, and through the fourteen or fi fteen 
years that I’ve been participating, I’ve seen a lot of people get to that kind of moment where they 
lost touch with life or, sometimes we call it an incident, I’ve seen probably a hundred thousand 
people get to what it was for them, and I’ve never ever had a sense of what mine was, until today. I 
fi gured there was something wrong with me, after fourteen years you’d fi gure it would pass by, but 
it never came up, and I’d like to share it if I could. When people stand up and share about having 
a horrible childhood, and having these terrible things happen to them, I didn’t have anything like 
that. I had the greatest childhood in the world, the greatest parents, they told me they loved me all 
the time, they sent me to the best schools. When I was about four years old, I was in the fi rst grade 
because I could read and write, I was a really smart little kid, and I got great grades, I got on the 
honor roll all the time, and I got merit badges and merit pins, and awards, and I didn’t even know 
half the time what they were giving them to me for. It wasn’t like I was working hard, or like I

did anything, I just went to school and I loved God and I did what my parents told me to do, and 
it worked. It was kind of like that for a few years. I remember starting third grade, and the fi rst 
day—and I always sat in the front row, I loved to participate—the teacher kept asking all these 
questions and I kept raising my hand, participating and answering the questions and was giving 
all the right answers, and the teacher said “You are going to be my best student.” She went on 
and asked another question, and I gave my answer and I got it wrong. And she looked at me and 
said “That was really stupid.” And that was it! That was it! I just said “Okay! Fine! We’ll do it your 
way” and it’s been that way ever since. And the funny thing is, I really got that’s defi nitely the 
point at which I started to withdraw. It started to become about me. Up to that point there wasn’t 
me, there was just participating and I felt like life was a privilege all the time...
KIPP
There’s something in there, a bit clouded. You might not have seen it. Up until that point there 
was just participation. Not me. When you’re really participating, you’re not even there. You 
know, when you’re really dancing, or really cooking, or really involved in something in life that 
you love—that’s happening, not you. 
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 13)
So when she said “You’re going to be my best student,” or whatever the hell she said to me, well 
I had never thought about that, I never thought that there was a best or a worst or anything like 
that. I started thinking, “Well, I’m going to be the best!” And the next stupid thing out of my 
mouth was the exact wrong thing to say, and I decided that...
KIPP
The next stupid thing out of your mouth was the next thing out of your mouth.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 13, laughing)
I don’t even remember what it was, and when I got in touch with it today, I was like, “ahh yeah! 
I fi nally got my incident!” And it made absolutely no diff erence to know what it was. None!

Thank you very much. You know, there’s a story in science called evolution. In that story, 
sometime, a long time ago, there was a little bit of something that became life in the water. It 
started to evolve over eons of time. And then in a moment, a fi sh walked out of the water onto 
land. That’s no longer evolution. It’s the evolution of evolution. That’s transformation. What 
the past four days have been about was providing you a clearing to walk out on the land. And 
the truth is you are not equipped for the land. What the seminars are about is equipping you to 
create a new possibility of growth and learning and extraordinary results on the land. And if 
you apply the rules of the water to see if you’re going to be in a seminar or not, they’re not going 
to work. I invite you to choose to be in a seminar. Don’t concern yourself with which seminar 
to be in. If the seminar reserved for you works, do that. If that night doesn’t work, pick another 
one. Some of you are saying, fi rst I’ve got to digest The Forum. I invite you to consider what

I fi rst started doing this work I’d get up in front of people and they’d send me up notes saying, 
“You are a disgusting person. Get off  it.” But I didn’t know how. And two things allowed me to 
get off  it. I gave my word to be a Forum leader. And the people in this room didn’t give up on 
me. They were more committed to me than I was. 
Kipp then set up for the seminar enrollment. A number of people in The Forum group—many of 
them WE&A staff  and Forum leaders—stood and moved to the enrolment tables that were placed 
around the room. There followed a period of about 45 minutes during which participants could 
register for a seminar series.
At the conclusion of the enrollment period, participants returned to their seats. It was 9:00 pm. 
Werner Erhard was on the platform.
ERHARD
Okay, as you know, we’re at the second half of The Forum now. Everybody clear about that? 
We’ve done enough going backwards; we’re starting to move forward. Nick?
NICK
You know this thing about mucking around in the swamp at the bottom of the Valley of the 
Shadow of Death: I’ve been swimming there for the past couple of months. The thing that I 
came face to face with was that I was afraid that I was a nobody. But it was more than being 
afraid, it was actually being a nobody. Last night we were driving home and I was sharing with...
ERHARD
Whatever you’re afraid you might be, you are, by virtue of being afraid that you might be. Not 
like you are for real. Whatever it is that you can’t be owns you.
NICK
When I was a kid, I had a great childhood, and I had a great friend. My memory of it was... like it 
was telepathy. We were completely, totally, absolutely related to each other. One time we both wore 
shorts, we both got cowboy boots for Christmas, and we walked around with them on the wrong 
feet, and had the best time, always together. We were almost never not together. I ate dinner at his 
house, he ate dinner at my house. And then one day during the summer between kindergarten 
and fi rst grade, his mother told me they were going to move and I was never going to see him 
again. I didn’t quite understand what that meant. One day they loaded everything up in a truck 
and a station wagon, and he got in the car and they pulled away and I never saw him again. In this 
work on rackets I was looking for this decision that I made, and it wasn’t a decision like something 
I could see happening. It was more like pulling out a tablecloth from under everything on the 
table. Everything was the same but it was suddenly diff erent. Completely diff erent. I knew there 
was something wrong. But it wasn’t like there was something wrong. There was something wrong. 
ERHARD
Nick has told this clearly enough that you can get it. I don’t know if you can picture it or not, 
but the scenery is all the same. All the scenery is the same except there’s something wrong.

NICK
I’m not sure that that has something to do with being a nobody, but I think it has something to 
do with being a nobody, because when I looked at the alternative to being a nobody, it wasn’t 
being somebody, because I created nobody to be somebody. And I know that sounds weird, but 
a nobody is a somebody; it’s not a nothing. And yesterday working through our rackets that’s 
what I was present to, and this afternoon talking about choice, the thing that I saw that I got 
out of all that was that I got to avoid the domination of being responsible for my life. Because, 
at that moment, if I could re-create it the way it looked, was... the choice was either to be, was 
not either to be nobody or to be somebody, the choice was to be nobody or to have to create it 
ongoingly. 
ERHARD
You want to get that last thing you said, Nick. That’s a critical point. Say it again.
NICK
The choice wasn’t between being somebody and nobody. The choice was really between being a 
somebody called a nobody, or nothing. And that just looked like absolute domination. 
ERHARD
The domination of the responsibility to create yourself. Better to be a nobody and avoid the 
domination of the responsibility to generate yourself.
NICK
Anything that is an opportunity to be somebody is a hook for me. Anything. And I am like an 
addict for...
ERHARD 
You understand that Nick sharing this with you takes the air out of it for him to some degree. 
That you can’t quite ever do that like you used to once you’ve shared it with people. You can’t 
quite get away with it anymore. You know, it’s become a public conversation. And you can’t 
get away with it as much anymore. You know Nick will try, because he’s thrown to that. And 
you and I will try what we are thrown to. But once you’ve made it public, you can never... it 
never quite has the grip on you that it used to. It never quite has the ability to own you that it 
used to.
NICK
I really have to laugh at myself, because...

That’s the place you want to get to about your racket.

There’s really two pieces to that. If you’re a nobody trying to be a somebody: That’s crazy. I

ERHARD
Can you hear the craziness in that? If you’re a nobody trying to be somebody, every action 
to be a somebody reinforces that you’re nobody. Every time you succeed in being somebody, 
it reinforces that you’re nobody. Only people who are nobody try to be somebody. It’s the 
whole thing I told you in that short piece I did with you about empty and meaningless: 
Even the accomplishments are empty and meaningless, because Nick’s accomplishments 
are all in order to be somebody, and each accomplishment simply reinforces that he’s 
nobody. Only nobody tries to be somebody. A somebody doesn’t try to be somebody. They 
are somebody. You’re not trying to be somebody. Only people who are nobody are trying to 
be somebody.
NICK
And that is the thing I was going to say. I’ve got a list of accomplishments that, I mean, I’ve got 
a good list of accomplishments. And the way that lives for me is that the past invalidates right 
now. And the future, like my dreams or my—nothing highfalutin like a vision—like the thing 
Wes was chasing around yesterday, the carrot, all that invalidates right now. It’s not only robbed 
me of satisfaction: I was looking at the cost, and clearly happiness is a cost. It also costs me 
vitality. I never saw that before. I’m tired all the time. 
ERHARD
Sit in the chair and try real hard for about fi ve minutes. It’s a big strain trying. Being is no strain 
at all. Trying is very stressful. Work is not stressful. Trying is stressful.
NICK
That was one side of the sword. The other side is I don’t know what makes a somebody 
somebody, but whatever the measure is that someone could come up with, I’m somebody. The 
other side of the insanity is denying who I am and what that cuts off  is my self-expression. So by 
not being myself, and having...
ERHARD
So what you want to get is that the whole conversation is crazy. Being nobody trying to be 
somebody and denying that he’s somebody. 
NICK
This is the insanity wrapped in the craziness. Werner, I just thank you for the profound 
privilege of participating in this work. I can see that who I have been is wanting to be anywhere 
but here. The only thing that’s diff erent is me. 
ERHARD
By the way, for those of you who were in Beyond the Winning Formula, this is the other side 
of “and yet.” One side is the experience of “I’ve accomplished this, and yet...” This is, “I didn’t 
accomplish this, and yet...”
Today, as we gather and order the phenomena in our world, we 
take for granted that they are. Beyond that, their Being is a matter 
with which we don’t concern ourselves.
That we don’t, according to Heidegger, is an outcome 
of developments in Greek thinking, and ultimately Western 
understanding, beginning with the thinking of the pre-Socratics. 
For Heidegger, this period has brought forth the beginning of 
philosophy—“one of the few great things of humanity” (IM 17)—
and also the beginning of its end. It bears repeating that “The 
great begins great, sustains itself through the free recurrence of 
greatness, and if it is great, also comes to an end in greatness. So it 
is with the philosophy of the Greeks” (IM 17). 
Greek thinking began as “the first and definitive unfolding 
of Western philosophy . . . when questioning about beings as 
such and as a whole received its true inception” (IM 15). But on 
Heidegger’s view, it “came to an end in greatness with Aristotle” 
(IM 17). Within two centuries, Greek philosophy had already begun 
digging the “ruts of metaphysics.”
What happened? For Heidegger, the evolution of Western 
thinking was an evolution in language; and here he turns 
specifically to the complex of terms that cluster around the Greek 
word on. Simply put, this is the noun-form derived from the verb 
to be (i.e., being; the plural is onta). But for Heidegger’s purposes, 
putting it simply is not an option, which he explains here:
Thus on says “being” in the sense of to be a 
being; at the same time it names a being which
is. In the duality of the participial significance
of on the distinction between “to be” and “a 
being” lies concealed. What is here set forth,
which at first may be taken for grammatical 
hair-splitting, is in truth the riddle of Being.
(EGT 32–33)
“
Even in contemporary English usage, we can identify examples 
of the ambiguity Heidegger is pointing out here. If I tell a friend, 
“You are stingy,” that friendship may be at risk. But if my friend

What I wanted to ask, you know, I’m standing at the threshold of not what I used to call 
possibility, but of nothing—like, really nothing.
ERHARD
There is no possibility for an authentic conversation for possibility until you are standing on 
nothing. And Nick’s gotten us to the right place because that’s where we are going. We need to 
demonstrate something. You have to watch that The Forum gives you a platform to stand on, 
and then The Forum is designed to pull the platform out from under you. So remember that 
whenever you get set, we’re going to pull the platform out from underneath you. “Oh now I got 
that! I got my racket!” Now we’re not interested in rackets. That’s horseshit. What is this rackets 
crap? Don’t get stuck back yesterday. Be with today. It’s a new ball game.
(pausing)
The question is: What is the source of action? Why do I act the way I act? I’m defi ning action 
broadly. Normally we think of action as just some kind of moving. Consider that your feelings 
are a kind of action, a kind of action in the world, and that your thoughts are a kind of action in 
the world. And so we’re asking in a broad sense, what is the source of action? Why do you and I act 
the way we act? Now there’s a standard answer, isn’t there? There’s an everybody-knows answer; 
there’s an everybody-knows answer, isn’t there? If I ask you “Why did you do that?” There’s an 
everybody-knows answer, and the answer that everybody knows is “I did it because I fi gured out 
that it was the right thing to do,” or “I did it because I have this thing in me that makes me act 
automatically, or I did it out of my experience, or my intelligence, or I did it out of my training.” 
It’s like that. Why are some people more eff ective in their actions than others? Tell me why. Why 
are some people more eff ective in their actions than others? Well some people have more talent 
than others, right? So we’ve got this notion that there’s something inside of us whence springs 
action. We look at someone and say that person has more talent than me and so they act more 
eff ectively than I do. Or he has more experience. Or she has more training than I have. Or he is 
more intelligent than I am and so he fi gures it out better than I can. We have an idea it’s talent, 
experience, training. I want to get you oriented because it’s not a question anybody asks. Nobody 
ever asks you what is the source of action? They ask why did you do that and you come up with 
that stupid reason, which doesn’t have any access to the source of action. But if you stop to ask the 
question... so I want you dwelling in the question, and I want you dwelling in the answer you dwell 
in. Let’s get this “dwelling” straightened out. You don’t think that the source of action is something 
inside you. You are that the source of action is something inside you. You don’t need to think it. 
Everybody get that? It’s not merely something you think. Without thinking you and I are that the 
source of action is something inside of people: either a quality you have, or an experience you have, 
or knowledge you have, or something of the sort. And I want you to see that you and I go through 
life and deal with life and deal with ourselves dwelling in that the source of action is something 
inside of ourselves. Anybody who can’t see that? Get your hand up.
SHERYL
I don’t see it.
takes an action that I find inconsistent with her generally generous 
behavior, I may say to her, “You are being stingy.” In the first case, 
my statement suggests a defect in the being she is; in the second 
case, I am pointing out an unpleasant way she is presently be-ing 
that being. The verbal diff erence is slight, but the diff erence in 
implication is significant. 
By the time of Plato and Aristotle, says Heidegger, on and onta 
had become conceptual—that is, they had become representations 
of already-thought ideas. They appear for us today as the roots 
of the words ontic and ontological. But for the pre-Socratics, who 
were for the first time raising questions about existence itself, the 
distinction between the event of be-ing—that is, emerging into 
unconcealment—and the entity which emerged and persisted, had 
never been thought before. 
As we have seen, physis is an ambiguous term with a complex of 
meanings, including both the event of a being’s emergence into 
unconcealment, as well as the being that has thereby emerged 
into unconcealment. The early Greek thinkers experienced this 
phenomenon in its entirety, says Heidegger. Their world was 
grounded in what the scholar Charles Guignon has called an 
“event ontology” (A Companion to Heidegger’s Introduction to 
Metaphysics. 36)—that is, they experienced not only the beings 
in the world, but their emerging and presencing as well. 
They experienced the logos as gathering. But they 
experienced it, says Heidegger, “without question” (IM 66).
In the thinking of Heraclitus the Being (pres-
encing) of being appeared as logos, as the
Laying that gathers. But this lightning-flash re-
mains forgotten. [. . .] In fact, the Greeks dwelt 
in this essential determination of language.
But they never thought it—Heraclitus included.
[. . .] Nowhere do we find a trace of the Greeks 
having thought the essence of language direct-
ly from the essence of Being. (EGT 76–77)

ERHARD
You and I are that the guy who can play tennis better than you or I might be able to do, can do 
so because of something inside of him or her. You get the point?
In the terminology of Heidegger’s Being and Time, the pre-Socratic 
understanding of their experience was pre-ontological (BT 32). 
In Guignon’s words, they never thematized the insight of their 
experience (A Companion to Heidegger’s Introduction to Metaphysics. 
37). If they had, says Heidegger, the world would undoubtedly be 
quite diff erent:
Language would be saying. Language would
be the gathering letting-lie-before of what is
present in its presencing. [. . .] Nothing less 
than this: the Greeks would have thought the
essence of language directly from the essence
of Being. . . . (EGT 77)
“
But human thinking took a diff erent path, and “Greek philosophy 
never returned to this ground of Being.” 
Instead, the focus shift ed to “the foreground of that which comes 
to presence . . .” (IM 66, emphasis added). With this shift , Western 
thinking began its evolution toward the metaphysical model—what 
Guignon calls a “substance ontology” (A Companion to Heidegger’s 
Introduction to Metaphysics. 36). Being as the happening of 
unconcealment was forgotten, and the ground of reality became the 
constant presence of what has been unconcealed—beings as present-
to-hand substance: beings as things.
In his reading of the Anaximander fragment—the oldest 
existing fragment of Western thinking—Heidegger finds a further 
clue to this evolution of Western thinking into the metaphysical 
tradition. The etymological path by which he arrives at this 
conclusion is complex and undoubtedly idiosyncratic, but we 
quote the passage at length because it resonates at a number of 
points with the languaging of Werner Erhard.
From early on [in the thinking of the Greeks] it
seems as though presencing and what is pres-
ent were each something for itself. Presencing
itself unnoticeably becomes something pres-
ent. Represented in the manner of something
present, it is elevated above whatever else is

Forum Day Four: Session Three 475
SHERYL
Yes.
ERHARD
That’s the point.
ERHARD
You and I dwell in, you and I come from, you and I are that the source of action is something 
inside of people. Is that clear? Like I said before, this is a corollary, a harmonic, an “also.” I’m 
going to tell you what I said before because it’s an “also”: That there’s a world out there that is a 
certain way and that my job is to get the representation of the world in here...
(pointing both hands at his head)
...which is accurate because I act out of the representation in here on what’s out there. And if 
my representation is accurate I will be eff ective in acting with what’s out there. Is that clear? 
You don’t think that; you don’t need to: You are that. You are that there’s a world out there, like 
an is world: The world is like this. And it isn’t like that. And my job is to get the representation 
in here or here, 
(pointing to his head and then his heart)
or wherever you think representations are, and my job is to get it out in the world out there 
accurately. And some people have more wisdom and more knowledge and more insight than 
others. And there are those of us who are arrogant enough to think that we have a special 
perspective on the world that allows us to see it rightly: “Those other fools who have just got 
it wrong because they’ve got the wrong perspective. Now I’ve got it right, you see?” At any 
rate, it’s all the same thing. It’s all that my actions are a product of what I know, or of my 
experience, but something inside of me, or the qualities I have. You know, smart, talented, 
whatever it is; or stupid, clumsy. You see, clumsy is a quality inside people, isn’t it? They walk 
around with it. It’s ready to put to use whenever they need it. That’s the way you and I are 
that it is. You and I are that it is like that. Is everybody clear about that now? And then the 
corollary: There’s a world out there that is a certain way—what I call an is world—can you 
hear “is world”?—an is world rather than a made-up world. There’s an is world; it is a certain 
way—and my job is to get a representation in here that’s accurate because I act out of what’s 
in here. If what’s in here is accurate then I’ll be eff ective with what’s out there. Does anybody 
not get that? 
(pausing)
So now we’re going to do a demonstration to look at the source of action, and we’re going to 
fi nd out that the source of action is not in here. So I say that the source of action is not in here, 
that you don’t have any qualities in you at all. All you’ve got is entrails. Guts. Goop. That’s 
what’s inside. Now that’s aff ronting, isn’t it? That’s aff ronting to who you are, because you 
are that there’s something inside called qualities and experience and talent and know-how 
and intelligence: because that’s the standard interpretation which you are. So I’m saying this 
present and so becomes the highest being pres-
ent. [. . .] Ultimately, presencing as such is not
distinguished from what is present: it is taken
merely as the most universal or the highest of 
present beings, thereby becoming one among
such beings. The essence of presencing, and
with it the distinction between presencing and 
what is present, remains forgotten. The oblivion 
of Being is oblivion of the distinction between 
Being and beings. (EGT 50)
But Heidegger hastens to add:
However, oblivion of the distinction is by no
means the consequence of a forgetfulness
of thinking. Oblivion of Being belongs to the 
self-veiling essence of Being. [. . .] This means
that the history of Being begins with the 
oblivion of Being, since Being—together with
its essence, its distinction from beings—keeps
to itself. The distinction collapses. It remains
forgotten. (EGT 50)
“
Here, some light is shed into the clearing of our question: why does 
the experience of transformation that is made available in The Forum 
occur as perpetually elusive? 
What gradually became forgotten was Being’s other aspect: 
its nature as emerging, its presencing and withdrawal, the not-
Being which is always the other side of Being. Beings became 
understood as permanent presence; lost was the recognition 
that the maintenance of the originary power of Being depended 
upon the persistence of the struggle, so that the event is 
continuously regenerated. Unconcealment is not a once-and-for-all 
accomplishment:

counter—commonsensical, counter—“what everybody knows” thing: I’m saying “no, that’s 
not the source of action.” We’re going to do a demonstration to see if we can actually get some 
insight into the true source of action. What we need is somebody who’s clumsy. 
Erhard called on a participant named Ellen, who then mounted the platform.
ERHARD
Thank you. You’ve got to be a little brave to be clumsy, because clumsy is not in.
ELLEN
That’s my racket.

Erhard and Ellen stood at opposite ends of the platform. Erhard began to toss her a tennis ball. She 
caught it several times.

I’m going to make it a little bit harder, because you’re less clumsy than you thought. And they 
need to see “clumsy,” so I’m going to bounce the ball in front of you.
Erhard bounced the ball in front of her, and after a few times, she failed to catch the ball to laughter 
from the group.
(continuing)
Wait, wait, wait. Missing the ball is not “clumsy.” That’s just missing the ball. The way you deal 
with the ball, that’s where clumsy is... Now we’re going to stop playing catch. We’re going to 
play a new game called “Which way is the ball spinning?” So you’re going to tell me which way 
the ball is spinning, and it doesn’t make any diff erence whether you catch the ball this time or 
not. 
Erhard threw the ball repeatedly. Ellen caught it some of the time and missed it some. Each time she 
reported which way the ball had been spinning, and then tossed it back each time. 
(continuing)
So you did that demonstration perfectly. Thank you, you’re wonderful. 
Ellen returned to her seat, and Erhard addressed the group. 
(continuing)
I started to throw the ball in places that were uncomfortable for her. She also started to use 
her body, and to step back to make it easier to catch, instead of stepping forward, which is an 
inappropriate reaction but a natural one for someone to whom the ball appears uncatchable. 
standing-forth; it alone also preserves beings
in their constancy. Where struggle ceases, be-
ings indeed do not disappear, but world turns
away. . . . Beings now become just something
one comes across; they are findings. [. . .] To be 
sure, beings are still given. The motley mass of 
beings is given more noisily and broadly than
ever before; but Being has deserted them. (IM
68-69)
“
Language is the house of Being, so language is the site of the 
struggle. Being deserts beings when their Saying becomes only 
talking, a speaking “in which no world is worlding any more. . .  
That which originally holds sway, physis, now degenerates into a 
prototype for reproduction and copying” (IM 68-69). 
Here Heidegger distinguishes two ways in which appearing 
may be understood, which we examined in “The Drift ” sidebar in 
Session Two of Day Four, and which we repeat here in an attempt 
to open up the space newly: “First, appearing denotes the self-
gathering event of bringing-itself-to-stand and thus standing in 
gatheredness. But then, appearing also means: as something 
that is already standing there, to proff er a foreground, a surface, 
a look as an off ering to be looked at” (IM 203, emphasis added). 
Appearing, in its first and “authentic” sense, “rips space open. . . 
it first conquers space; as standing there, it creates space for 
itself.” Appearing in the second sense “merely steps forth from an 
already prepared space, and it is viewed by a looking-at within the 
already fixed dimensions of this space” (IM 203-204). Appearing 
in the second sense may be characterized as dogma, or received 
wisdom, or relating to the self or others as possessing “qualities,” 
such as being “stingy” or being “big.” In Werner Erhard’s work, this 
distinction is also developed in the term sharing: to share one’s self 
in communication is to conquer the space—to create context as 
one speaks, and in such a way that shift s the way the world occurs, 
with which our actions are correlated.
 But here is the tricky part of this distinction: appearing that 
rips space open is always ripping space open. Otherwise it would

Nobody told her to do that: How did her actions change? What happened is this: Ellen’s actions 
are perfectly correlated to the ball. They’re not perfectly correlated to the “is” ball; they’re 
perfectly correlated to the occurring ball. See, you watch where the ball goes, and you’re sitting 
out there observing, so the ball looks like it’s more or less diffi  cult to catch, it’s going more or 
less fast, or whatever it’s doing, but that’s not what Ellen’s watching. What Ellen was watching 
was the occurring ball. You get the diff erence between the two? At fi rst the ball occurred as 
fast and small, and her actions were perfectly correlated with a small and fast ball. Later, after 
she got oriented, the ball got bigger and slower. Instead of being up there like a threat, it was 
fl oating up there, and she could reach up and catch the ball. Now I’m going to make the point 
more clearly for you. 
Erhard walked to the back of the podium to the table there to get a dictionary.
(walking back holding the dictionary)
So you can tell what the source of action is, we’re going to handle it with the dictionary. So 
you’ve got to watch!
Erhard suddenly tossed it off  to one side into the audience. A participant caught it and then tossed it 
back. This process was repeated several times. 
ERHARD
Do you see any talent down there? Do you see any experience down there? Do you see any 
know-how down there? No: just dictionaries fl ying and people’s hands moving. See how 
that happens? No talent; no experience: just the dictionary and people’s hands moving. Is 
that clear? Action is a correlate of the occurring. However the ball occurs, your actions will be 
perfectly correlated. You get a truly uncoordinated person, or a person who calls themselves 
uncoordinated, and you lob the ball at them... it doesn’t look like that. It looks like a pea 
traveling at supersonic speed. You want to see a true athlete dealing with a pea traveling at 
supersonic speed? I’ll show you how clumsy 
they look. 
Erhard then called for someone who was athletic to come up. Erhard began tossing the ball to this 
participant, but threw it widely, to a point where he was unable to catch it. Erhard pointed out to the 
group how “clumsy” the athletic participant looked. 
(continuing)
That’s how the ball looks to somebody “clumsy,” where the ball occurs as uncatchable. He 
acts like Ellen acts, like the occurring “uncatchable ball.” Actions are correlated to the ball as 
occurring. Correlate is a diffi  cult word for people because we think in terms of “because,” or 
“cause and eff ect.” Correlation is not cause and eff ect. His actions are perfectly correlated to the 
ball as an occurring ball. Ellen’s actions are exactly the same: perfectly correlated to the ball as 
occurring. Your actions in life, what you do at work, the way you act with your wife or husband, 
the way you act with your friends, the way you act with things, are a correlate of the occurring. 
become appearing in the second sense: an already prepared space. 
Presence as an event of coming-to-presence is always coming-to-
presence, or it becomes constant presence.
To be always coming to presence, a being must be always 
withdrawing. If a being’s existence in the world occurs as an event, 
then each occurrence of the event must end with a return to the 
state from which the event begins. The state from which an event 
of Being begins is non-Being; therefore the happening of Being 
must include non-Being as the context to which it can return and 
from which it can begin. 
This was the nature of the sway, where unconcealment always 
returned to concealment, and meaninglessness was always the 
context for meanings. In bringing the sway to stand in the world, 
the pre-Socratics were creating a world in which beings did not 
attain a state of constant presence, but were always wavering, 
always “held out in a questioning manner into the possibility of 
not-Being” (IM 31).
This wavering has been forgotten. Heidegger’s purpose, and 
that of The Forum, is its recovery. ■

There’s no such thing as action, there’s only action-in-the-world; “world” as an occurring and 
“action” are correlates of one another. That ball looked uncatchable to you. That’s how the ball 
looks to somebody called “clumsy.” It looks uncatchable, and their actions are those of anybody 
else, athletic or not, their actions are the same, because the actions are not a product of a 
property inside one’s self called “athletic.” People’s actions are a correlate of the way the world 
occurs for them. Anybody didn’t get that?
JERRY
I didn’t get it.
ERHARD
What didn’t you get? Did you get that we are talking about the source of action?
JERRY
I heard it.
ERHARD
There’s a diff erence between hearing and getting. Did you get that we’re talking about the 
source of action? Is that clear to you?
JERRY
Yes.
ERHARD
So what didn’t you get? “I didn’t get...”
JERRY
I didn’t get that it’s the same thing when you throw the ball over there to him as when you 
throw it to her and she doesn’t catch it. 
ERHARD
That’s good. That’s clear. Now we can have a forwarding discussion. So, his actions down here 
are correlated to an uncatchable ball, yes?
JERRY
Correlated to me means “goes along with.”

That’s close enough for the moment, yes. His actions are consistent with—go along 
with—an uncatchable ball, yes?
JERRY
Yes.

ERHARD
Now, you think that the ball is uncatchable or isn’t uncatchable. I’m telling you that his 
actions are not correlated to an “is uncatchable.” His actions are correlated with an “occurs as 
uncatchable.” Occurs. You get the diff erence?
JERRY
I get the second, what was the fi rst...?
ERHARD (throwing the ball to a participant in another part of the room from Jerry)
Let me ask you something: Was that ball uncatchable for you?
JERRY
Yes.
ERHARD
No, because there’s a possibility of your catching the ball. 
(throwing the ball the same way again)
Catch that ball. What happened?
JERRY
I didn’t catch it. 
ERHARD
Because it occurred as uncatchable for you. 
JERRY
Right.
ERHARD
Is that clear for you?
JERRY
Yes.
ERHARD
And if I’m a certain way, and the ball goes like  that,
(throwing the ball again)
the ball occurs as uncatchable for me. If I threw the ball and it occurred as uncatchable for you, 
you wouldn’t have put your hand up like that, you would have acted “clumsy.” So your actions, 
and her actions, and my actions, and his actions are all a correlate of the ball as an occurring, 
not the ball as an is. That ball is going a certain rate of speed and it is within a certain number 
of inches from your body.
Event Ontology
 To begin, try this: imagine that the phenomena in the world 
around you—people, trees, dogs, the sky—do not merely exist, but 
are at every moment coming into existence. Imagine that when you 
look at a tree, you aren’t observing a thing that is just there, but 
an event. The tree is occurring. Instead of just a tree, like a thing, 
you are in the presence of a happening: treeing. The happening is 
ongoing, as the tree withdraws from the world and emerges—its 
emergence and withdrawal so correlated in time that they are 
perceived only as a quality of aliveness. You sense the withdrawal,

JERRY
I hear you. I’m worried that I’m missing what “is” means.
ERHARD.
Good. Listen up. You told me what you didn’t get. We would say, you and I, because of the way 
you and I are, that the ball is going at a certain speed, and it is arriving at a certain proximity to 
your body at a certain place. So we would say it is catchable depending on how fast it’s going 
and on how far it was when it started coming at you...
JERRY
I have a problem concentrating on what you’re saying. I’m sorry. It’s like you’re talking too fast 
or I’m thinking too slow.
ERHARD
I understand: We’re talking in a place where you have your foot nailed to the fl oor. It’s all right. 
You’re doing great. Just tell me to slow down.
JERRY
Thank you. Please slow down. 
ERHARD
We’re contrasting an “is” ball and an “occurring” ball.
JERRY
I understand an occurring ball, I don’t understand an “is” ball.
ERHARD
The ball is going at a certain speed, yes? And the ball is in your range of vision for a certain 
amount of time. 
JERRY
Okay.
ERHARD
That’s what is, you and I would say. It is going at a certain speed. And it is in your range of 
vision for a certain amount of time. And you and I would say if it is going in this envelope of 
speed—not faster than this, but in this envelope of speed—and if you have that much time to 
watch the ball going at that speed, the ball is catchable.
JERRY
Right. I got it.
ERHARD
So that’s an is catchable ball. But you and I do not act on “is ball”; you and I act on “occur ball.” It 
doesn’t make any diff erence how fast the ball is going. Your actions are correlated to how fast the ball 
and the absence, as a persisting background that contextualizes 
your experience of the presence. In the presence of something, 
you sense the possibility of nothing.
Heidegger scholar Susan Schoenbaum has proposed an 
interesting analogy as a clue to this world of emergence and 
withdrawal: the way the diff erentiation between foreground and 
background occurs for us in our visual consciousness: 
In this diff erentiation, the background is deter-
mined as receding into indetermination as the
foreground becomes more or less determinate.
The phenomenal movement of foregrounding
and backgrounding, the coming to be back-
ground and the coming to be determinate fore-
ground, all occur simultaneously. This complex
movement of determination is originary in the
sense that it makes simultaneously possible
(a) the determination of background (however 
indeterminate) as background and foreground
as foreground, (b) the consequent appearing
of determinate beings that appear (in the
foreground), and (c) the coming into being of 
the entire constellation as context or world,
including background, foreground, and the
determinate movements of diff erentiation. All
these aspects belong to an originary event of 
diff erentiation of background and foreground.

Metaphysics, 149–150, emphasis added)
“
In other words, there is much going on in our perception of the 
world that happens below the level of awareness even as it shapes 
that awareness. 
 Imagine now that this is the nature of reality: that we live 
in a world of be-ings, rather than merely beings, a world that is 
renewing itself in each instant. And imagine further that you, as a 
being in that world, are likewise emerging newly in every moment. 
Imagine that “you” are not a fixed phenomenon, but that, like 
the tree, you occur, for yourself and for others, and withdraw, and 
occur, a new being in each occurrence. Imagine that a human

occurs as going. See you and I think that the guy who hits the ball over the net in tennis all the time 
has skill. No. That’s a guy for whom the ball comes over the net very slowly and very big. That’s the 
diff erence between him and me. He does not have some property inside himself that I don’t have.
JERRY
So you’re using “occurs” as the way the ball is perceived? The way the ball is seen or perceived?
ERHARD
Yeah, I don’t like that and it’ll get you into trouble if you push it too far, but yes, that’s a correct 
understanding. It’s not mere perception. It’s not mere seeing. It’s an ontological phenomenon, 
not a physiological phenomenon. It’s the way the ball occurs. So here’s what I’ve said so far. 
Your actions are not a correlate of “is.” Your actions and her actions and my actions and his 
actions are all perfectly correlated to the occurring ball. And why some people look clumsy to 
us is because we don’t realize their actions are correlated to the occurring ball; we think their 
actions are correlated with the is ball. It is going a certain speed. It is in their sights for a certain 
amount of time. 
JERRY (laughing)
This sounds pretty simple to me now.
ERHARD
Yeah, it is.
JERRY
Everybody else have that?
ERHARD
Yeah, they got it listening to you.
JERRY
I guess my problem was I didn’t know what you meant by occurring and what you meant by is.
ERHARD
You and I don’t dwell in the distinction called “occurring.” You and I dwell in the distinction 
called “is.”
JERRY
Why not?
ERHARD
A thing called stupidity.
JERRY
Kids dwell in occurring, don’t they?
being is an event—an event with language, and therefore very 
diff erent from trees, but nevertheless a happening, like all of the 
other beings in the world, where absence is always the background 
accompaniment to presence. Nonexistence is the background for 
your existence. 
According to Heidegger scholar Charles Guignon, such a 
world is what Heidegger was aiming to retrieve for human beings. 
Guignon calls it an event ontology, an alternative to the substance 
ontology that has dominated Western thinking, in which the world 
is just a collection of things. Such a world of events may sound 
tenuous and risky; but consider: might you, reborn anew in every 
moment of now, be more alive to existence? Might such a world be 
more vivid, more challenging, more engaging? Might living in that 
world keep you on your toes, or on the edge of your seat?
Heidegger proposes that the reality we have imagined here 
was what the world was like for the early Greeks. This is also the 
nature of the transformation that occurs in The Forum, where 
participants get Nothing as a liberating context for their lives. ■

They dwell in “is” too. Nobody coaches occurring. They coach is. They tell you how to hold the 
racket.
JERRY
How about the guy who wrote the book Inner Tennis. He coaches occurring, right?
ERHARD (walking toward Jerry and then standing right in front of him) 
He doesn’t talk about it that way, but he does “occurring.” What makes Tim Gallwey’s coaching 
eff ective—Tim coaches a shift in the occurring; he’s not trying to change the behavior. No 
matter how much I know how to behave, I’m going to behave as a correlate of the occurring. 
I’m not going to behave like I know how to behave. That’s true about you because you didn’t 
always behave the way your mother told you to behave. By the time I was fi ve years old, my 
mother told me everything I needed to know about how to be a decent human being. I had all 
the knowledge I needed. Didn’t make a damn bit of diff erence. I was a rat. You too. You tell 
yourself what to do, but you don’t do it, do you? 
JERRY
Sometimes.
ERHARD
Yeah. Sometimes. But you always, your actions are always correlated with the occurring of 
the world. That dictionary fl ies through the air, your hands will move in a dance with that 
dictionary, because your hands are correlated with the occurring of the world.

Don’t believe. I want you to get it.

Well it feels like I’m missing something, because you’re saying it like it’s a big deal.

Yeah, it is a big deal. I’ll tell you what the big deal about it is: Stop trying to change 
yourself. Stop trying to put properties inside of yourself. Stop trying to get yourself to do 
the right thing. Alter the way the world occurs for you, and your actions will naturally 
alter. You get that?

JERRY
I felt I wasn’t listening. I had the problem that I didn’t hear what you said. I wasn’t listening.
ERHARD
I understand. You didn’t hear me because you were listening to your barriers to hearing what I 
was saying. And the barriers to hearing what I was saying were provoked by what I was saying. 
We’ve been doing that for four days here. We say stuff  that we don’t expect you to get. We say 
stuff  designed to drive the barriers up in front of your face. Then we keep dealing with the 
barriers. Then you start to drop the barriers. Then all of a sudden it’s empty and meaningless, 
and then it’s like “well, obviously it’s empty and meaningless. Why didn’t you just say that in 
the beginning?”
(laughter)
Clear? Give me my ball back. Thanks.
(applause)
Let me say it all over again. Here’s what I want you to get out of this. Your actions are not the 
actions you want, or the actions you decide. They’re not a product of your past; your actions 
are a correlate of the world as an occurring, not the world as an is world, but the world as an 
occurring world. Your actions are perfectly correlated to the way the world occurs for you. If 
the world occurred for you like it occurs for the person you most despise, you would act like 
the person you most despise. No shit. Really. I know you think you’ve got goodness and all 
that bullshit inside you. Go to the doctor and have him open you up so you can see. Cut that 
noise out. Your actions are a correlate of the world as an occurring. You want me to throw the 
dictionary a couple more times so you can see? Now the question is, “Well, what generates this 
occurring?” We’re going to get to that, but not until you get... see you’re almost as stupid as you 
were when you came in here, because you’re sitting out there trying to decide whether you 
agree with this or not.
(laughter)
“Is that right? Do I agree with that? I practiced tennis for ten years, and that practice really 
made me a good player. And I remember learning buh buh buh, and that made me better at 
that.” Wrong! The practice and the learning alters the occurring. Staying in the conversation 
Jerry and I were having: you know, you train an athlete. Most people train athletes like they’re 
grooving in behavior, so you do it repetitively, that’s what training is, right? Repetition. So you 
do it over and over and over again so you can do it automatically. Horseshit. Anything you do 
automatically lacks skill, lacks power. You wouldn’t want an athlete who acted automatically. 
You want an athlete free to act with the world he or she has to act within. What happens is, 
Your actions are not the actions you want, or 
the actions you decide. They’re not a product 
of your past; your actions are a correlate of the
world as an occurring, not the world as an is
world, but the world as an occurring world.

you take behavior out when you train an athlete with repetition. You take behavior out, not add 
behavior. He has to do this. You don’t want him to do that. Let him keep doing that and he’ll 
stop doing that if the training’s any good, and he’ll be free to do anything. When he’s free to do 
anything, he’ll deal with the ball eff ectively. You don’t need to tell people “step back when the 
ball bounces in front of you.” Because you’re never going to be eff ective when you’re trying to 
remember what to do when the ball bounces in front of you. When the ball bounces in front 
of you as catchable, you step back, because stepping back is perfectly correlated with the ball 
that bounces in front of you and is catchable. Stepping forward is what you do when the ball 
bounces in front of you and it’s not catchable. 
(pausing)
Is it starting to get through? Not “do you agree with it?”: Are you able to stand in the possibility 
that my actions in life are not a product of internal properties? My actions in life aren’t a product 
of anything. My actions in life are a correlate of something. What they are a correlate of is the 
world as an occurring. For example, if the world occurs as threatening, your actions will be 
perfectly correlated with a threatening world. The question is not: “Is the world threatening?” 
The question is: “Does the world occur as threatening?” It’s not that one person is strong and 
the other person weak. You think you’re strong, let me put you in a set of circumstances that 
occur suffi  ciently threatening and you will cower. People who cower are not weaklings. The 
world occurs for them as overwhelmingly threatening. People who are musical: Music occurs 
for them in a way that it doesn’t for those of us who are not very musical. The keyboard does 
not look like it does to you and me to a pianist. Totally diff erent. I did an experiment driving a 
racecar for a year. Didn’t know anything about racing cars when I started. Didn’t even drive for 
the most part when I started. I had a license. I hadn’t been in a gas station for something like ten 
years. When I started out, the car went very fast. Really fast! I mean overwhelmingly fast. Except 
for the guy on the sidelines who had the stopwatch. For him it was going very slow. But the 
slower the car went for me, the faster my times were. I could see divots in the roadway a quarter 
of an inch deep and put the edge of my tire in that divot. The car got real slow. Real easy to 
drive a car slowly. You get into a race car and drive it slowly, it’s easy. Takes no talent, no ability, 
which was very good in my case. The slower the car goes the faster the times are, because action 
is a correlate of the occurring. How many people in here manage other people? 
(several participants raising their hands)
How many other people in the room raise children? That’s managing people, by the way.
(more raising their hands)
Good. Put your hands down. You want to know why your kids act like they do? Because 
the world occurs for them in such a way that their actions are a perfect correlate. They do 
not do what you tell them to do. No shit. And if you think they’re doing what you tell them 
to do, you’re wrong. Their actions are a correlate of the way the world occurs for them. 
People murder not because they are bad people. Nobody has ever found bad inside anybody. 
People murder because murder is a perfect correlate to a certain kind of occurring. The 
law recognizes that by recognizing self-defense. Never mind how they explain it. Ellen is 
not clumsy. Her actions are perfectly correlated with the way objects occur for her. She’s

hand, but an “I didn’t get that” hand.
Seven people stood. Erhard moved to work with Art, and requested of the others that if they got it 
when Art got it, they should sit down.
ART
I’m trying to come up with answers. The occurring for life... That’s just how they see it.
ERHARD
It’s not quite right, and what’s not quite right about it is that it’s not a physiological 
phenomenon; it’s an ontological phenomenon. The ball exists as slow or fast. It’s not seeing. It’s 
not perceiving. The ball exists as slow or fast. It’s not “I see the ball.” The ball is, like existence, 
slow or fast. 
ART
I’m trying to put that into my life. I used to ride motorcycles and I could ride really fast and I 
can see little things in the road at ninety miles an hour.
ERHARD
Because the bike is occurring as slow for you.

Well I’m with the bike, I know how to do that.

No. That’s your explanation. You do not know shit about how to do it. As a matter of fact, go out 
on your bike and try to ride it out of what you know. Try it. You race your bike?

Yes.

Try racing your bike out of what you know.
ART
I’d pop the clutch and it would shut off .
ERHARD
Yeah, exactly. You don’t race out of what you know. You race out of the occurring. So let me ask you...
(getting the dictionary and then tossing it at Art)
what does your behaving have to do with what you know?
While Martin Heidegger’s thinking was consistent in its focus 
on the question of Being, his philosophical inquiry led him along a 
number of paths within this domain. None is of greater relevance to 
our current cultural situation than his perspective on technology, 
a subject central in his thinking during the last forty years of his 
career (Zimmerman, “Beyond ‘Humanism’” 219). In this light then, 
it is significant for our inquiry that Werner Erhard has chosen the 
name “technology of transformation” for his own project (“The 
Heart of the Matter” 1985). In these series of sidebars concerning 
technology, we will show how Erhard’s choice of this term 
indicates, paradoxically, both a crucial intersection of his work with 
Heidegger’s thought, and at the same time, Erhard’s contrast with 
what we might call Heidegger’s “racket”—a persistent complaint 
with a fixed way of being—concerning modern technology.
Regarding technology, Heidegger is emphatic on two 
points. First, we have misunderstood its nature; and second, as a 
consequence of this misunderstanding, we have underestimated 
its role and influence in the current human condition. Our 
problems with technology—which might include overuse, 
inadequate mastery, overreliance, and addiction—do not arise 
because of some incorrect understanding of technology, for 
instance, as a human contrivance, as an instrument for our use, 
or as a means to serve our ends. Rather, our problems with 
technology have arisen in an epoch in which we can no longer 
grasp that “the merely correct is not yet the true” (“QCT” in 
BW 313). Our instrumental understanding, wherein anything 
worthy of understanding must be able to be put to use, fails to 
reach deeply enough to capture technology’s essential impulse. 
Here Heidegger develops that particular point: 
Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to
technology, whether we passionately aff irm
or deny it. But we are delivered over to it in
the worst possible way when we regard it as
something neutral; for this conception of it, to
which today we particularly like to pay hom-
age, makes us utterly blind to the essence of 
technology. (“QCT” in BW 311–312)

ART (having caught the dictionary)
I just reacted.
ERHARD
That’s your explanation. There wasn’t any reaction. There was a dictionary and hands. You 
made up “reaction.” That’s your story about what happened. All that happened was a dictionary 
fl ying and your hands moving. 
ART
Yes.
ERHARD
You didn’t say to yourself, “Oh, put the microphone under my arm, reach out my hands...” None 
of that happened. None of your athletic experience there either. Not one bit of it was there, was 
it? 
ART
No.
ERHARD
No. Nothing. What was there was fl ying dictionary and moving hands; because your hands—
the motion of your hands—are a correlate of the dictionary as an occurring. Suppose the 
dictionary... give me my dictionary back.
(laughter as Erhard receives the dictionary back from Art)
If I throw the dictionary at you so you can’t catch it, what are you going to do? You’re going to 
go like this, aren’t you?
(fl inching)
Not like you did the last time. Why? Because you’re not athletic? No, because the dictionary 
occurs as uncatchable, and your actions are perfectly correlated with an uncatchable dictionary. 
Got it?
ART
Yes, but it just seems foggy. Like I’m always trying to come up with an answer for everything. 
I don’t want to use the wrong words here. I can understand but I want to come up with an 
answer for it.
ERHARD
No, you want to put it to use. You mean, “Shit, I can’t fi gure out a way to use this yet.”
ART
Well, I don’t see how to apply it to my life.
And in What Is Called Thinking he posits that
. . .the essence of technology is not anything
human. The essence of technology is above 
all not anything technological. The essence of 
technology lies in what from the beginning and
before all else gives food for thought. It might
then be advisable, at least for the time being,
to talk and write less about technology, and
give more thought to where its essence lies, so
that we might first find a way to it. The essence
of technology pervades our existence in a way
which we have barely noticed so far. (WCT 22)
“
Heidegger concludes this thought with a reversal: “Our age is not 
a technological age because it is the age of the machine, it is an 
age of the machine because it is the technological age” (WCT 24). 
We are reminded of one of the central rhetorical figures Erhard 
employs throughout The Forum, in many instances, wherein the 
commonplace understanding we have of ourselves as conscious 
agents of our lives is thrown into question: “You don’t think it; it 
thinks you.” As our thinking enters into this antithetical “figure of 
thought”—which rhetoricians term chiasmus—again and again 
during the course of The Forum, this way of thinking, as a technology 
of transformation, opens us toward new possibilities to be.
But if we hold this figure of thought at a distance, refusing 
to follow its course, it loses any of its transformational power. As 
scholar Hubert Dreyfus observes, Heidegger’s position with regard 
to technology is easily misunderstood as a position, when it is 
more appropriate to follow it as a movement. Dreyfus writes that 
Heidegger’s “view is so radical that one is tempted to translate 
it into conventional platitudes about the evils of technology, so 
Heidegger’s ontological concerns are mistakenly assimilated to 
ontic humanistic threats about the devastation of nature, the 
atomic threat, the media, consumerism, et cetera” (“Gaining a

You can’t apply this in your life. It applies you; you don’t apply it. Weren’t you here earlier to

Yes.

All you’ve got to do is get it. It will use you. 
ART
And once I try to do it that’s when I screw it up.
ERHARD
Exactly. But that’s a little off  too because that’s another answer.
ART
Right.
ERHARD
Don’t turn it into an answer. All there is to do is to get it. Here’s what there is to get: My actions, 
my way of being, my feeling, my thoughts, my self, are a correlate of the world as occurring. 
You get that?
ART
Yes.
ERHARD
Good. Sit down. Very well done.
BOBBY
What I got is that you’re talking about “muscle memory.” 
ERHARD
What is muscle memory? What’s the diff erence between muscle memory and muscle spirits? 
(laughter)
One is in vogue and the other one is not in vogue. “The catching God moved my hands.” What’s 
the diff erence between that and muscle memory? They are both explanatory principles. They 
both explain what happened. And the only other diff erence is that one is in vogue and the other 
is not in vogue. Neither one of them has anything to do with having any access to your behavior. 
What does muscle memory have to do with having access to your behavior?
Free Relationship to Technology”). But Heidegger’s focus is a less 
apparent threat, namely, the threat posed by “the technological 
understanding of Being” (ibid). Technology, for Heidegger, is a 
manifestation of a particular way of Being; and it is that way of 
Being, rather than technology itself, that poses the real danger. ■

BOBBY 
Well then I don’t get it. I thought that’s what you were talking about. 
ERHARD
That’s not what we’re talking about. You heard me say muscle memory?
BOBBY
That’s how I translated it.
ERHARD
Yeah: Don’t translate me. I speak perfectly what I mean. If you translate it, you don’t get it. 
What I said was, your actions are a correlate of the world as an occurring. Your actions are not a 
product of properties inside you including something called muscle memory. You get that? 
BOBBY
I heard you.
ERHARD
Did you get it?
BOBBY
Well, I’d have to translate it to get it. 
ERHARD
Don’t translate it. Just get it. My actions—the way I act—are a correlate of the world as an 
occurring. That’s what there is to get. I don’t act like I act because I’m stupid, or because I’m 
smart, or because I’m ambitious, or because I got drive, or because I think positively. They’re 
all explanatory principles. They have nothing to do with the source of action. They explain 
action beautifully. You could say that you’re possessed by a certain kind of spirit. That explains 
it perfectly, doesn’t it? Some people are possessed by good spirits, some are possessed by bad 
spirits. Doesn’t that explain action? You don’t like that explanation. But doesn’t it explain 
action? Does it not? What’s the diff erence between that explanation and the explanation that I 
act because of properties inside me? The only diff erence is that one is in vogue and the other is 
now out of vogue. This is a conversation for gaining access to action, not for explaining action. 
Remember I told you the fi rst day? Remember that X thing? This side you get explanation, this 
side you get access to the source of the action. We’re talking about the source of action, not the 
explanation for action. Somebody asks you why you act the way you do, you tell them properties 
because what they’re looking for is understanding. You want something to say about your 
actions, start dwelling in the possibility, the distinctions, that your actions are a correlate of the 
world as an occurring. Is that clear?
BOBBY 
It sounds like reaction, but I know that’s not what you mean.

ERHARD
That’s quite right, it’s not reaction. Is the back of my hand reacting to the front of my hand? No. 
It’s correlated to the front of my hand, isn’t it?
BOBBY
Right.
ERHARD
Another word for correlation is something like dancing. You and I dance together; you don’t 
move because I move. I don’t move because you move. We move in correlation with one 
another. Our motion is correlated. That’s what correlated is: It’s like dancing. You need a poetic 
understanding of correlation. Like dancing. Clear?
BOBBY
I don’t understand how catching the dictionary is like dancing.
ERHARD
It’s exactly like dancing. And what you’re dancing with is a fl ying dictionary. And Ellen dances 
with the ball as uncatchable sometimes and at other times she dances with the ball as catchable. 
In both cases, Bobby, her actions are perfectly correlated to the ball.
BOBBY
No thinking.
ERHARD
It’s not a matter of “no thinking.” There may be thinking as well. That’s not the point. The point is 
that her actions are perfectly correlated to the ball when she’s graceful and perfectly correlated to 
the ball when she’s clumsy. That’s why I got someone who was athletic up, because he looks clumsy 
when I throw the ball to him in a way that he can’t catch it. That’s pretty clumsy. When I throw the 
ball to him so that it looks catchable to him, he’s very graceful in his dealing with it. Clear?
BOBBY
Yeah.

ERHARD
You don’t have to steer the car anymore, do you?
BECKY
No, right, I don’t.
ERHARD
The road steers the car. You don’t steer the car. The road steers the car. Because when you fi rst 
got into the car your actions were a correlate of what you were told to do. That’s all that was 
there for you. “Oh, let’s see, he said to do this! Oh, he said to do that! Don’t do this, do that!” 
Your actions were correlated to the telling because that was occurring. There wasn’t any road 
out there. The road was just frightening. Now there’s nothing between you and the road. The 
road does the steering. You don’t say “Curve. Turn slowly.” Your actions are perfectly correlated 
with the road as an occurring.

MIKE (the participant who had the “stupid” racket)
I don’t understand. You threw a ball over there, with the gentleman standing over here. He can’t 
catch it.
ERHARD
No. You say he can’t catch it. There are athletes who could catch that ball. If that was an ape, 
the ape would have caught it. The ball is catchable, but the ball occurs as uncatchable. How 
close does the ball have to be to you to be catchable?
MIKE
It depends on how fast the ball is coming...
ERHARD
At a given speed, how close does it have to be?
MIKE
A ball at a given speed?
ERHARD
Yeah, how close does it have to be to be catchable?
MIKE
I have to be able to run to it in time in order to be able to catch it.
ERHARD
And that depends on how fast the ball is moving.
MIKE
Correct.
ERHARD
Very good. And how fast the ball is moving is not determined by a radar gun. It’s determined by 
the speed the ball occurs for you. Guys who play baseball for a living, play baseball with big, fat, 
Techne
 To develop the perspective on technology and the danger posed 
by the technological understanding of Being, Heidegger turns, 
as he oft en does, to etymology in order to explore the historical 
meanings deeply embedded in our language. “In the word, 
in language, things first come to be and are,” he says (IM 15). 
Therefore the way the world occurs for us today can be traced to 
the way it was originally understood and put into language by the 
first Western thinkers, the pre-Socratics, who lived at a time when 
the increasing complexity of phenomena emerging from the flux 
required the development of a deeper understanding of things. 
In their response to this challenge, so Heidegger’s account 
runs, the Greeks unavoidably set a direction for Western thinking; 
and from that meaningful beginning, the “play of Being”—the 
evolution of human thinking and thus of human Being—can 
be traced through history, culminating in our current view of 
ourselves and our world. “What is Greek,” says Heidegger, “is the 
dawn of that destiny in which Being illuminates itself in beings, 
and so propounds a certain essence of man; that essence unfolds 
as something fateful . . .” (EGT 25).
A central artifact in this archaeology of language is the Greek 
word techne. Heidegger notes that “the Greeks, who knew quite a 
bit about works of art, use the same word techne for craft  and art 
and call the craft sman and the artist by the same name: technites” 
(PLT 59). Over time, techne came to mean the activities of the 
craft sman, primarily the work of making things; so its subsequent 
evolution as a term for the functioning of technical instruments is 
not surprising. But Heidegger asserts that this meaning is “oblique 
and superficial,” and that the word techne “never means a kind of 
practical performance. The word techne denotes rather a mode of 
knowing” (PLT 59). 
But it is knowing in a unique mode: techne is knowing that 
creates what is known. It reveals things by bringing them forth for 
the first time, a stage in the creative process that precedes the 
act of making. When a house or a ship is to be built, it is revealed 
before it is produced: 
ERHARD (continuing)

slow, baseballs. Guys like you and me who play baseball once at the company picnic, we play 
with very small, supersonic bullets... 
(laughter)
...and our behavior is correlated to uncatchable balls. See you were not a creep when you were 
sweeping up and missed those spots. The fl oor occurred as clean for you. And you stopped 
when it did, like anybody would, like your father would. The fl oor occurred as not clean for 
your father. Therefore, for your father you should have kept sweeping.
MIKE
So I could have caught that ball if I saw it big, and slow, over there?
ERHARD
Let me ask you a question. Forget that you can’t reach it because there are people around you. If 
I threw the ball over there...
(throwing the ball)
...could you catch it?
MIKE
There’s a possibility.
After receiving the ball back from another participant, Erhard threw the ball farther away from 
Mike.
ERHARD
If I threw it there could you catch it?
MIKE
No.
ERHARD
Who said so?
MIKE
I said so.
ERHARD
Because the ball occurs for you as uncatchable.
MIKE
So if it would occur for me as catchable I could catch it.
This revealing gathers together in advance
the aspect and the matter of ship or house, 
with a view to the finished thing envisioned as
completed, and from this gathering determines
the manner of its construction. Thus what is
decisive in techne does not at all lie in making 
and manipulating, nor in the using of means,
but rather in the revealing. . . . It is as reveal-
ing, and not as manufacturing, that techne is a 
bringing-forth. [. . .] Technology is a mode of 
revealing. Technology comes to presence in the
realm where revealing and unconcealment take
place, where aletheia, truth, happens. 
(“QCT” in BW 319) 
“
For Heidegger, what is fundamental in techne, and therefore in 
technology, is not the tools and instruments it manifests, but 
that it is a way of disclosing entities as entities. Here we find 
a harmonic with Erhard’s technology of transformation as the 
process of distinguishing distinctions, the distinguishing of which, 
entirely in language, discloses worlds within which human beings 
have access to acting on and fulfilling new possibilities for Being-
in-the-world beyond what is already and always given for human 
beings to be: the in-order-to—the techne—of our technological age. 
Techne as the in-order-to discloses entities as raw material and 
resources that can then be used up to enhance power and security, 
and a correlative way of Being is brought forth in that disclosure, 
in that manifestation of the tools and instruments techne calls for, 
a technological way of Being that on Heidegger’s view poses great 
danger to us.

There would be the possibility of catching it and your actions would be consistent with catching 
it. Let me ask you a question: Have you ever seen a great athletic feat?

If you don’t move, you don’t catch. Did you hear what I said?
MIKE
If you don’t move, you don’t catch.
ERHARD
Yeah. So. Guys who move have the possibility of catching. And you see them do things you 
thought were impossible. You get that now? Is that clear? You don’t move, you don’t catch. And 
you only move when the ball occurs as catchable. These are not guys calling for superhuman 
eff ort from themselves. These are guys who because of certain ways they are trained see a ball 
as catchable like a possibility, which you don’t see. You don’t catch the ball every time I throw it 
right there, do you?

Not for guys with high batting averages: That looks like a home run. A ball traveling that fast: 
That’s a ball with home run written on it. That’s like me picking up this ball off  the fl oor for

Same ball traveling at the same speed according to the radar gun, occurs one way for one person

Sure. If I cut your arms off  and throw you the ball, it’s uncatchable.

Don’t bring up this stupidity: It’s going to make you look silly. I’m not talking about some kind

No, it does not. I said it can’t. If you can’t get it down the tube—if the tube’s blocked—your

We’re not talking about growing a third arm here. So it’s a trivial conversation to get stuck in 
this muscles and bones and nerves thing. I’m willing to do it if we need to because I’m someone 
who can stay up all night. But that’s not the conversation that you and I ought to be having 
when we’re talking about your being able to behave eff ectively.
MELINDA
Okay.
ERHARD
Growing a third arm is a diff erent conversation. It’s true that your body is a tube down which 
this gets expressed, but it’s only the tube. You know, I’ve worked with brain-damaged children. 
There’s no less of a person there. There’s less of a person expressed. No question about it. There 
are ways to get around the limits of the tubes. Blind people function with the same equipment 
I’ve got at a way higher level than I do. Your body is merely the tube down which this gets 
expressed. The tube is trivial.
(Melinda sitting)
About the occurring, and about access to the occurring... We now know that access to action is 
in the occurring. You don’t gain access to action through decisions, and making up your mind, 
and all that other nonsense. That’s a very weak access to your actions. If you checked and 
counted up how many times you made up your mind and then checked how many times you 
did what you made up your mind to do: very infrequently. It’s a lousy access to action. Takes 
you forever to produce any eff ective action that way. Takes years of practice and discipline to 
produce any eff ective action that way. And it isn’t the way to produce action, even taking years 
to do it. It’s just a stupid way to behave and it’s based on a stupid explanation; an ineff ective way 
to behave based on a stupid explanation.

Now here’s another hard part. Where does the photographic image occur? Not on the paper! 
Because if the photographic image occurred on the paper, everybody who looked at the paper

Oh, I apologize: I forgot you were a photographer. I don’t want to know about taking pictures; 
I want to know where the photographic image occurs. So if you show me a photograph: Where 
does the image occur? It’s not on the paper.
BARRY
It’s the person who can recognize it there. 
ERHARD
Where does that recognition happen? 
BARRY
Through an association?
ERHARD
Not through association. The photographic image occurs in a medium called the possibility of 
a photographic image. Now, how long is it going to take you to get this? This is pretty simple. A 
photographic image occurs in a certain medium. The name of the medium is the possibility of 
a photographic image. To say it a bit more rigorously, a photographic image occurs in a medium 
called photographic image as a possibility. Photographic image as a presence, as an occurring, 
occurs, happens in a medium called photographic image as a possibility. Is that clear?
BARRY
No.
ERHARD
Then you’re going to have to go home without that being clear then. Sorry. It’s hard.
(Barry sits)
The medium of occurrence is possibility. Possibility shapes the occurring. What Ellen and 
I did was to shift the realm of possibility in which we were working. In one realm we were 
working on the possibility of catching the ball. That had a smaller possibility for Ellen. In the 
other realm we were working on the possibility of telling me which way the ball was spinning; 
that had a bigger possibility for Ellen. Hence, the ball traveling at the same is speed, alters 
its occurring speed, because occurring is a phenomenon which arises in a medium called 
possibility. Not possibility like you mean possibility, something that might, maybe could, 
maybe happen. Photographic image as a possibility is like—listen!—a clearing in which 
photographic images can happen. It’s not a maybe, might. It’s not made up of photographic 
images either. Photographic image as a possibility is not made up of photographic images, 
any more than “two” as a possibility is made up of examples of two. As a matter of fact, 
examples of two arise in the possibility “two.” So, access to your action, access to your feeling: 
Enframing
For Heidegger, our technological understanding of Being emerges 
in three stages: “challenging,” “standing-res erve,” and “enframing.”
Challenging
“The revealing that rules in modern technology,” Heidegger says 
first, “is a challenging (Herausfordern), which puts to nature the 
unreasonable demand that it supply energy which can be extracted 
and stored as such.” Thus the “earth now reveals itself as a coal 
mining district, the soil as a mineral deposit.” Heidegger protests 
this development as a significant change from the days of “the old 
windmill.” While the windmill served human beings, the call for its 
service was left  to the wind’s blowing, since “the windmill does not 
unlock energy from the air currents in order to store it.” Modern 
technology, on the other hand, “sets upon nature,” always driving 
on toward “the maximum yield at the minimum expense” (“QCT”

SPEAKING BEING
You’ve got no access to your feelings right now, do you? Yeah, you can’t feel sad if you want 
to feel sad. You can’t be happy if you want to be happy. The circumstances determine your 
happiness or your sadness. And all you got to deal with your feelings is fucking around with 
your circumstances. So you do what you think you need to do to create circumstances that will 
make you happy. And they don’t. They gratify you for a little while, and then you’re unhappy 
again. So, to gain access to your actions, to gain access to your feelings and thoughts, as 
actions so to speak, you need to see that your actions and thoughts and feelings are a correlate 
with the occurring. And the occurring arises, occurs, in a medium called possibility. So now 
the question is: “Well, how do I gain access to this possibility stuff ?” Because if I can shift 
possibility, I can shift occurring; and if I can shift occurring, I can shift action. But you’ve got 
to get possibility like I’m saying it, not like something that might happen. That’s an option. 
Something that might happen is an option. That’s what Mike and I were talking about back 
there, options. “If the ball is over there, I might be able to catch it.” That’s an option. “And if 
it’s over here, it’s more likely that I’ll catch it.” That’s a better option. These are options, not 
possibilities. Possibility doesn’t limit. It opens up. It frees one, not limits one. So possibility is 
the medium of occurring, and occurring is the correlate of action. Does anybody not get that? 
You’re starting to slide back into the fi rst day. You’re starting to wonder how to use this stuff . 
“I don’t understand it.” What you’re really saying is “I don’t see its applicability. I don’t see 
how I’m going to apply it, or use it. I don’t see how this is going to make me thinner, or richer, 
or younger, or sexier. So I don’t understand it. If it isn’t going to make me thinner, or richer, 
or younger, or sexier, then what is it?” So now the question is, “Where do I fi nd possibility?” 
And the answer to that is in the ape never picking up the stick because he might fi nd bananas 
hanging in the jungle clearing later on. Possibility arises in languaging. And I use the term 
languaging instead of language so you don’t confuse what I’m talking about with vocabulary 
and syntax and grammar. You know, music is languaging, action is languaging when it speaks, 
and actions do speak don’t they? And “in a glass,” which is never said, and is yet present 
without being said by virtue of what is said, that’s languaging too. And you want to know 
what? Sitting in a chair is languaging. A lot of people would look at a chair and never sit in it. 
It would look stupid to them: silly, uncomfortable, or nasty. Like sitting on two stakes sticking 
up. You look at two stakes sticking up—that doesn’t look too comfortable to us. There are 
people who look at a chair and don’t see it as a comfortable place to sit. It’s something to stand 
on to get something in the cupboard that’s up high. Not a place to sit. And the way it occurs 
to you is a product of languaging, not a product of what it is. Is a chair a chair? No, it’s not an 
is chair, it’s an occurring chair. In other cultures it occurs as something to stand on to get up 
to the cupboard that’s up high. It’s not an is chair; it’s an occurring chair. And your actions 
with it are exactly like they are with the dictionary. Your actions are correlated to the object as 
an occurring. So we’re sneaking up on a statement: You do have something to say about your 
actions. You do have something to say about it. And why you have something to say about it is 
because possibility arises in language. 
At one point during this conversation, at about 10 pm, the doors to the room were opened and 
about two hundred people fi led into the room and seated themselves in rows of chairs that had been 
placed at the sides and rear. These were friends of the participants who had previously taken The 
Forum, and who had been invited by them to join them, for this portion of the course.
in BW 320–321). As Michael E. Zimmerman has pointed out, this 
new way of revealing has now overtaken even the windmill: “Forty 
miles east of San Francisco in Livermore, California, thousands 
of turbo-driven windmills cover the hills  as far as the eye can 
see. The wind’s energy is, in fact, being  harnessed and stored to 
produce electricity” (Heidegger’s Confrontation with Modernity 
216). However, what stands in the way of windmills being really 
useful as a power source is merely that no power can be generated 
when the wind isn’t blowing. The solution, which is already likely 
at hand, will be to invent super batteries that could store up the 
energy for use and distribution when and where we need it. This 
would transform the “freely flowing” wind into something stored 
up, standing at the ready, in reserve.
Standing-Reserve
This situation reveals a second stage of the technological 
understanding of Being, which Heidegger calls Bestand, or 
standing-reserve. In this mode of revealing, says Heidegger, 
“everything is ordered to stand by, to be immediately on hand, 
indeed to stand there just so that it may be on call for a further 
ordering” (“QCT” in BW 322). This mode of revealing distorts the 
appearance of things: the airliner on the runway, for example, 
“conceals itself as to what and how it is.” 
Revealed, it stands on the taxi strip only as
standing-reserve, inasmuch as it is ordered to
insure the possibility of transportation. For this
it must be in its whole structure and in every
one of its constituent parts itself on call for 
duty, i.e., ready for takeoff . (“QCT” in BW 322)
“
David Tabachnick has provided a useful contrast between 
the old and new ways of revealing, between the techne of the 
craft sman and the techne that we observe in current technology. 
For the craft sman, “‘bringing-forth’ describes a working in 
partnership or co-operation with the nature of materials to 
construct an artifact, such as a chair or a house, while the 
contemporary technologist is described as ‘challenging-forth’ or 
changing the nature of materials to make them stronger, more

Forum Day Four: Session Three 501
Erhard called on Jane, the young woman with whom he had interacted with on Days Two and Three 
about her being “worthless” after having no one she invited come to her birthday party.
ERHARD
Jane and I were having a discussion when she was standing over there. And I said: “are you 
going to act out of being worthless and ugly?” And she said “not as much but probably some.” 
Right? Something close to that?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Is that true or false? It’s neither. The question is garbage. She has shaped the possibility for her 
future actions because she shaped the world as an occurring, by speaking a possibility. She said 
“my possibility is limited to this.” 
(holding up both hands to eye level)
This is how big the possibility is. It’s that big because she said so. It’s not that big because she 
believes it’s that big, and not because it is that big, not because it’s her opinion that it’s that big. 
It’s that big because she said so. Remember, languaging is not just what’s coming out of your 
mouth. I don’t say “in a glass,” and yet it’s there in languaging. I want to make sure nobody 
confuses what we are saying with “positive thinking.” See, I’m not asking her to think positively. 
I don’t like positive thinking. I’m an anti-positive thinker. I like honest thinking, not positive 
thinking. I like straight thinking, not positive thinking. I know that possibility is a product of 
languaging, but I don’t like the word product: possibility arises in language... and that Jane 
can be a conversation for the possibility of anything she wants to be. See, where am I going to 
fi nd “ugly”? Can I fi nd anything ugly in somebody’s face? This is not some nice platitudinal 
horseshit. Things are ugly, but they’re ugly in people’s mouths, not on people’s faces. Ugly is not 
a phenomenon that arises independent of language. My dog looks at me and sees neither ugly, 
nor anything else about me, because ugly is a phenomenon that only arises in language. There’s 
no ugly in anybody’s face or body. Faces and bodies are just like they are. Ugly is a phenomenon 
that only arises in language. This doesn’t sound very useful, does it? It sounds what you call 
abstract or conceptual. See, there’s a diff erence between is ugly and occurs as ugly. What’s 
the diff erence between is ugly and occurs as ugly? Something called plasticity, malleability, or 
something more aptly called possibility. If something is ugly you’ve got to adjust to it, don’t you? 
(forcefully)
It is ugly so you have to adjust to it. If it occurs as ugly there’s the possibility of some 
malleability, some plasticity, you might be able to shape it in a new way if it occurs as ugly. I 
want you to begin to see that there’s a lot of what you deal with that only arises in language. 
And because it only arises in language, you’ve got something to say about it. You’ve got 
something to say about being ugly—no shit—because ugly only arises in language. I’ve seen 
a lot of women whose features don’t measure the perfect standard who are extraordinarily 
beautiful and so has every other man in this room. Beauty is not a matter of standard features. 
flexible, longer lasting, etc.” Tabachnick continues, explaining that, 
for example,
A doctor may “bring forth” the already avail-
able health of an individual through medicine,
whereas cloning or genetic engineering “chal-
lenge” the natural bounds of the body, creating 
a wholly new “artifact” with diff erent charac-
teristics. As Heidegger details, earlier human
inventions did not permanently impose a new
form onto nature. Under normal conditions, be-
cause the material of an artifact was still bound
by natural characteristics, nature would always
“shine through” the imposition of the artist,
craft sman or technician. A carpenter imposes
the form of a chair onto wood, but once the
chair is finished that wood still maintains its
natural characteristics to rot and decompose
in the same way a fallen tree rots and decom-
poses on the forest floor. In other words, the
craft sman’s chair is a site of openness for the
revealing of nature. (Tabachnick 2004)
“
Tabachnick compares these earlier technologies with some that 
are representative of more recent developments, “technologies 
that do not co-operate with nature but attempt to replace it”: 
A nuclear engineer can manipulate the struc-
ture of natural elements to produce artificial
elements. Plutonium, for example, is designed to
never abide by or return to the characteristics of 
the uranium from which it was derived. The char-
acter of plutonium (i.e., its level of radioactivity)
is always artificial. Likewise, the genetically
altered human is designed to never return to the
natural characteristics of the material from which
it was derived (e.g., a sick or weak body) and
thus is always artificial. In turn, contemporary

SPEAKING BEING
It’s a way of being, not features. You know, it’s nice to have good equipment, but too fucking 
bad, you’ve got the equipment you’ve got. Ugly is a conversation. That’s all it is. You can’t fi nd 
ugly anyplace in the universe except in people’s mouths. That’s a metaphor. Now I’ll say it 
rigorously. You can’t fi nd ugly anyplace but in languaging. And if you’re listening to this like 
some platitude, then you are truly an asshole. This is hard stuff  I’m taking about. Not “nice 
nice.” And “worthless.” Where am I going to fi nd “worthless”?
JANE
In the conversation “worthless.”
ERHARD
Yeah. Beautiful. See, you’ve got something to say about “worthless.” You’ve got nothing to 
say about your feelings. You can’t feel anything but what you’re feeling. You’ve got nothing to 
say about how you feel. But you’ve got something to say about worthless and ugly. Because 
worthless and ugly are a conversation, that’s all. One is a conversation for being worthless, or 
one is a conversation for being ugly. And that becomes the possibility in which life and the 
world and your own image occurs for you. You don’t see yourself when you look in the mirror. 
You don’t see yourself like an is, you see yourself like an occur; you see yourself as an occurring 
self, not an is self. And what occurs in the mirror is not in the mirror. It’s in languaging, 
therefore, you have access to what occurs in the mirror: Like a conversation for the possibility 
of being beautiful. It’s idiotic to walk around saying “I’m beautiful,” especially if you look 
like me. You look like her, maybe, because there’s some agreement for that. I didn’t say I walk 
around speaking positively. I said it’s possible for me to be engaged in the conversation for the 
possibility of being beautiful. I and you and the world will occur in the space, the clearing given 
by that conversation for possibility. And my actions, and my feelings, and my thoughts, will be a 
correlate of that occurring. And my actions, and my feelings, and my thoughts will work on the 
world. You getting this?
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
And so you have something to say about this. What you say about it is none of my business. 
That’s your business. We know why you said you were ugly and worthless, because you got 
something out of that, right? For the payoff . Remember the payoff  conversation?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
And so ugly and worthless was a racket for a payoff . But there’s no payoff  for the possibility of 
beauty. Beauty as an assertion, “I am beautiful,” like describing yourself, like you are an object, 
there’s a payoff  in that. But there’s no payoff  in the possibility of beauty. As a matter of fact it 
puts you further at risk, because now you’re at risk for being beautiful. When you’re ugly you 
technological artifacts do not disclose nature.
And, because in a technological society so much
of our world is filled with these “undisclosing 
artifacts,” we are cut off  from, become unaware
of, or forget the essential movedness or tran-
sience of existence. (Ibid.)
We remind the reader that we are not advocating a universal 
return to wooden furniture; we do not regret advances in medical 
science that employ new materials. To do so would be tantamount 
to the demonstration Wes carried out during The Forum, earlier 
in Day Four, of arguing with the floor. At the same time we are not 
making an ethical statement concerning what the technological 
understanding of Being has done to human beings such that 
we might, as a matter of course, accept without question even 
radically dangerous technological advances. Here we are simply 
focusing on the view that we are already in a technological way 
of Being-in-the-world, and therefore, what is at issue is the way of 
being human that has emerged with these developments.
One principle way of being human that has emerged is one that 
Erhard himself has exemplified in his development of his technology 
of transformation: entrepreneurship. The term “entrepreneur” 
stems from the French term entreprendre, to undertake. An 
entrepreneur is an enterpriser. Far from accepting or even tolerating 
the way things already are, the entrepreneur envisions and reveals, 
through originary naming, new possibilities which alter the way 
the world occurs. With language we impact the occurring world 
and consequently, our Being, for our Being is always and already in 
a dance with the occurring world. We bring into Being what could 
never be without being said into Being: we speak Being.
The relationship to modern technology at work in Erhard’s 
technology of transformation does not immediately square with 
Heidegger’s persistent complaint that holds our technological way 
of being as presenting us with profound danger. The diff erence is 
subtle, and will require us to walk a thin line as both thinkers are 
nevertheless treading the same waters. 
For instance, if we envision Heidegger’s understanding of 
our technological way of being as harmonic with the in-order-to

If you’re beautiful, you’ve got to put your lines out. You understand why?

Yeah.

Do you understand trolling?

Yeah.

Trolling is a game called being alive. And it’s as meaningful as everything else in life. Zero. 
Therefore you’re free to play. And there are certain agreements in society about playing. And

Forum. You’re really beautiful. 
JANE
Thank you. 
She sat to long applause from the group.
Erhard moved to the chalkboard, and drew three circles. The fi rst two he labeled “story” and “what 
happened.”
ERHARD
Remember on the fi rst day, we drew these two circles. One was your “story” and the other 
circle was “what happened.” So there was what happened, and there was your story about what 
happened, and then we talked about the vicious circle where those two domains got collapsed, 
and you couldn’t tell the diff erence between what happened and your story about what happened. 
And you began to think that your story about what happened is what happened. And that makes 
people suff er. Just like putting your hand on the gas stove makes you suff er. That’s why you 
can’t trust psychology, because all of the then-known facts in psychology had been established 
with experiments with rats and college sophomores, neither one of which might be human—I 
don’t know about college sophomores, but I know that rats are not like human beings. And the 
diff erence between a rat and a human being is a rat will stop crawling into the oven if it gets 
burned, and human beings will keep crawling into the oven. Forever. Why? Because “it’s the right 
fucking oven, and I believe in it.” And then we got more sophisticated and said there were two 
realms of existence: that what existed, existed as a presence, and what existed, the same stuff , exists 
as a concept. These are two distinct realms of existence, domains of existence.
mechanism of the “they” self, the two thinkers appear side-by-side, 
but this is only a semblance. For Heidegger, one notable eff ect of 
understanding the world as a source of resources is that humans 
have surrendered their role as the self-certain ontologically centered 
subject. Since standing-reserve is an “inclusive rubric,” it moves us 
beyond the Cartesian subject-object model in which we have come to 
conceptualize our relationship to things. Instead, says Dreyfus, “we are 
passing from the subject-object stage to the stage in which the culture 
is becoming, one might say, one big cybernetic system” (“Gaining”). 
Clearly, this is not the overcoming of Cartesian subjectivity that the 
early Heidegger of Being and Time and Erhard—from the est Training to 
the present—have been working toward. It is not the opening for a new 
possibility of Being for human beings. Instead:
As soon as what is unconcealed no longer 
concerns man even as object, but exclusively 
as standing-reserve, and man in the midst of 
objectlessness is nothing but the orderer of the
standing-reserve, then he comes to the brink of 
a very precipitous fall, that is, he comes to the 
point where he himself will have to be taken as 
standing-reserve. (“QCT” in BW 332, emphasis
added)
“
This precipitous fall, we off er, has already taken place: this is the 
way of being human The Forum addresses in its participants from 
the very beginning. Those seeking to improve, to acquire the tips 
and techniques to overcome and change their lives for the better, 
who take any morsel of wisdom and put it to use, all the better to 
order it, but in the process they—we—unwittingly rob the truth, 
as unconcealment, of its power—this is the way of being that self-
destructs against the bulwark of the Nothing the inquiry of The 
Forum brings to presence.
Enframing
And so, we arrive at the final stage in the way modern technology 
reveals the world: “the essence of modern technology,” says 
Heidegger, “lies in enframing [Gestell]” (“QCT” in BW 328). This

ERHARD (indicating the “story” circle)
In this realm there are things like explanations.
(indicating the “what happened” circle)
And in this realm there are things like experience. So one is the experience and the other 
is the explanation of the experience. This was the whole story at the time we discussed this 
earlier. We were going backwards. We got to zero, we got to empty and meaningless. Now 
we’re seeing that there are two sides to The Forum. The fi rst side is “What is the already 
always being of human beings?” And the other side is “What is the possibility of being for 
human beings?” Now you heard “What is the possibility of being for human beings” as the 
something maybe, could I, might be, maybe, like some stupid image you got of yourself as 
thin and sexy and young and rich, or whatever your silly notion is for your self. Holy. It fi ts 
in there. The same crap.
(indicating the fi rst two circles) 
That’s what you got born with. That’s what came with the package—those two domains. There’s 
another domain. 
(drawing a new circle to the left of the “what happened” circle)
It doesn’t come with the package. You don’t get it for free. 
(indicating the “story” circle)
You can talk about that domain right here, but that’s talking about it. That’s like eating the 
menu. 
(indicating the third, still empty circle to the left of the “what happened” circle and of the “story” 
circle)
A lot of people talking about this domain.
(indicating the “what happened” circle)
You can even have experiences of it. People who merely have the experience of it get weird. Lot 
a weird people in this room, by the way. They gravitate to California. 
(laughter)
People with the experience of that other domain: Makes them weird. They can’t get over it, so they 
stay weird. They’ve got no mastery of the domain. They don’t dwell in the domain; they don’t come 
from the domain. They don’t dwell in it, but they’ve touched it experientially. Everybody in the room 
has had that experience. Everybody. Some of you haven’t had enough of that experience to be weird 
yet, that’s all. You know that experience where you don’t have to eat, where you don’t have to go to 
the bathroom, and you don’t have a home, and there’s nothing but what you’re doing. You’re not even 
there, right? It’s like when you get out of the way, and there’s that thing that happens when you’re out 
of the way? By the way, when do you come back? When it goes bad. Right away you’re right there: 
“Oh shit!” 
is the culmination, the gathering of the challenging-forth and 
ordering, the box in which human beings as resources already 
find themselves at this juncture in our history. To employ the 
vernacular, the technological way of Being is a done deal: “The 
actual threat has already aff licted man in his essence. . . . Thus the 
question as to how we are to arrive at a relationship to the essence 
of technology, asked in this way, always comes too late” (“QCT” in 
BW 333, 329). In a 1966 interview with the German newsmagazine 
Der Spiegel, asked what was missing in the world when, aft er all, 
everything seemed to be functioning and production was at a 
peak, Heidegger replied: “Everything is functioning. This is exactly 
what is so uncanny, that everything is functioning and that the 
functioning drives us more and more to even further functioning, 
and that technology tears men loose from the earth and uproots 
them” (in Zimmerman’s Heidegger’s Confrontation with Modernity 
199, emphasis added). Thus uprooted, says Dreyfus, human 
beings “become a resource to be used, and more importantly to be 
enhanced, just like any other resource” (“Gaining”).
And yet, it is Erhard’s technology of transformation that brings 
forth its participants to arrive at such a relationship to the essence 
of technology, right in the midst of being torn loose from the earth, 
used and enhanced as any resource would be, caught up in the 
relentless logic of the in-order-to. Rather than turn away from the 
technological way of being we are thrown to be, the inquiry of The 
Forum directs its participants to come face-to-face with it, to own 
up to it, to be in the trap that it is for human being. ■

Forum Day Four: Session Three 505
ERHARD (continuing to laughter)
That’s you. You’re “oh shit!” That’s how we know when you got back. 
(laughter; indicating third empty circle)
So a lot of what the second half of The Forum is about is access to this domain. And you and I 
are not going to do as good a job at access to that domain as you were getting to zero, because 
you all were a pain in the ass and it took too long to get to zero. If you didn’t hear me making 
you wrong, I was just making you wrong. 
(laughter)
The other side of that is that we haven’t gotten our shit together to get The Forum to zero 
quickly enough to do a good job on the second half. That’s making me wrong. You notice 
nothing changes, no matter who’s wrong?
(laughter and applause) 
The point is that we can’t do very much more than open up the second half of The Forum. 
That’s as much as we can get done, because you all need your beauty sleep.
(laughter)
Okay, so what is this domain? If it’s not experiential, and it isn’t; it’s not conceptual, and it isn’t: 
What is that domain?
(writing “possibility” in the third circle) 
Simple. It’s the domain of possibility. Not this possibility or that possibility,
(indicating the “story” circle)
...that’s here. You could say that it’s the possibility of possibility. But there’s no such domain. 
No matter where you go to look for it you can’t fi nd it. You can’t have it unless you invent it. 
You have to invent the possibility of possibility. You want to listen to that. People don’t have 
possibility in their lives. They have options. Options are futures generated from the past. The 
past could work out like this, or it could work out like that. You know, common conversation 
between people. Things could work out like this, or they could work out like that. “They’re 
likely to work out like this, but oh boy would I love them to work out like that, but that is 
not very likely.” That is not possibility; that is “options.” Options are conceptual. And your 
experience—listen up—your experience will mostly be limited to the options that you give 
yourself to experience. It’s the vicious circle all over again.
(indicating the “story” circle)
The options are here. Why do I call them options? Because they’re derived from your past 
experiences! The options shape your future experience. And the option-shaped experiences 
reinforce the options. So now you fi nally got yourself fi gured out so you don’t need to get 
up in the morning anymore, because there’s nowhere to go. Why bother? You already know 
how it’s going to be, so why bother? The only reason why most of you get up is because you

handled. We don’t handle that in here. But most of you get up because you like suff ering. I 
mean, you must like suff ering: That’s what you do. And you know you’re going to do it. No, 
what gets you up is hoping, hoping you’re going to make it, hoping it’s all going to work out, 
hoping it’s somehow going to be diff erent, hoping you’re going to get the answer. What’s that?
(in response to a participant calling out, Erhard repeats)
Yeah. You suff er hoping. Exactly. Hoping keeps you suff ering. Why would you bother getting up 
in the morning if you know what it’s going to be like?
(walking back to the chalkboard to indicate the “possibility” circle)
At any rate, you’ve got something to say here. You’ve got nothing to say about experience—you 
can only report on it more or less accurately. 
(indicating the “story” circle)
And you’re limited to what you say here reporting on experience. This is reporting on that.
(indicating the “possibility” circle)
Here you are free. Now, there’s one little catch. A pipe dream is not a possibility. Pipe dreams 
and possibility are not the same thing. Possibility is the future. You could say that the past could 
have possibly been like this. But in the future, we might learn that the past was really diff erent 
than what we thought. Possibility is always future. It’s got that kind of temporality: future. And 
you’re going to have pipe dreams and call them possibility. I’ll tell you how to tell the diff erence 
between a pipe dream and possibility. There is no future, which will ever be realized, which is 
not an extension of the past when it happens. All futures will be an extension of the past. There 
are no discontinuous futures. Not in your lifetime, because all futures, when realized, have a 
continuity with the past. There is nothing that ever happened that was inconsistent with the 
past. If necessary, the past is rewritten. On the basis of Columbus and Einstein, the past was 
rewritten. See, it was true the world was fl at, until someone did something inconsistent with 
that. Then we said, oh, it wasn’t fl at. How the hell do you know it wasn’t fl at? The point is that 
you’re free to create possibilities for your life and you want to ground those possibilities by 
bringing the possibility back into the present. Like standing in the future to create a future. And 
then you tease it back to the present, so there’s a structure to fulfi ll that possibility. But that’s too 
technical, and we don’t have the time to go into all the technicalities tonight. All I’m going to 
tell you is this: If you live with possibility, you live with both risk and power. None of this works; 
it’s only empowering. None of this is the answer, and it is empowering. Life is authentically 
risky. You got the wrong idea about life. You think life is about reducing the risk with fi nding the 
answers. You want to cheat. If you want to reduce the risk, play tennis with three-year-olds. You 
win all the time. Makes you feel great. 
(laughter)
If winning all the time makes you feel great then you like playing tennis with three-year-olds. 
Winning doesn’t make people feel great. Being powerful and able and playing and dancing, 
that makes people feel great. And to do that you’ve got to have power, and that’s what we’re 
ERHARD (continuing)
All I’m going to tell you is this: If you live with
possibility, you live with both risk and power.

talking about here: What we’re talking about here is empowering yourself, not reducing the 
risk. We’re not talking about giving you the answers so that you know how to beat people; it 
just reduces life and people to a three-year-old. That’s silly. If the point was getting to the top of 
Mount Everest, some goddamn entrepreneur would put an elevator on it. The question is: How 
powerful and how able can you be in the face of the risk called Mount Everest? 
(pausing)
Okay. So we’re almost home. We’ve got two more defi nite steps. And the fi rst step is a step 
called responsibility. Remember the choice exercise? You discovered something about choice 
that was inconsistent with the interpretation you already had that choice was, and that there’s 
a certain power to distinguishing choice the way you distinguished it during the exercise. Same 
thing about responsibility. The fi rst thing you want to get is, responsibility is not blame or guilt 
or fault. When I say I’m responsible, I’m not saying I did it, or I am to blame or that I’m guilty. 
When I say I’m responsible, what I mean is that I stand for being cause in the matter. Not “I 
caused it.” It’s a stand for being cause in the matter. 
(indicating the “possibility” circle)
And you can’t take a stand without this domain. Without this domain, your stand is a mere 
position. Some position you’ve taken on the matter. I don’t know if you’ve been watching this 
over the past four days, but your positions have gotten you into a lot of hot water. Your positions 
have ruined your life a little bit. Or a whole lot.
(pausing)
Without this domain... See, a possibility is established by taking a stand for something as a 
possibility. A position is established by setting something up as something toward which you 
are working. Possibility is something you are free to realize, which is diff erent than something 
you are working towards. It’s like you’re free to realize whatever it is that you’re willing to stand 
for. That’s diff erent from working towards something. Can you imagine: Working toward hitting 
the ball over the net in tennis does not make great tennis? Or working toward dancing. My 
mother only made one mistake in raising me. She sent me to the Bala Cynwyd Women’s Club to 
learn to dance. This was a big mistake.
(laughter)
Knowing where to put your feet is not dancing. I didn’t know that for a long time. 
(indicating the “possibility” circle) 
The action in this realm is declaration. 
(indicating the “story” circle) 
The action in this realm is assertion. 
(indicating the “what happened” circle) 
The action here is expressives. These are Speech Acts, but that’ll get too complicated. To 
understand declaration, you have to go to an umpire convention. 
See, a possibility is established by taking a
stand for something as a possibility. A position
is established by setting something up as some-
thing toward which you are working. Possibil-
ity is something you are free to realize, which
is diff erent than something you are working

er it is that you’re willing to stand for. That’s

SPEAKING BEING
Here Erhard told the story about the three umpires: the rookie umpire who said he “calls them like 
they are,” the experienced umpire who said he calls them “like I see them,” and the master umpire, 
who said “They ain’t anything until I call them something.” 
ERHARD
That’s declaration. See, the umpire’s got the power of declaration. What is it? If President Carter 
wakes up in the middle of the night, says “to hell with glasnost, I’m sending the bombs out,” 
what does Rosalynn say? “Shut up, Jimmy, go to sleep.” But if President Bush does it, Barbara 
runs for the bomb shelter. Actually, the president doesn’t do that, but never mind; it ruins the 
story if I go into that. This power of declaration: That’s what it takes to be responsible, because 
being responsible is merely a declaration. It is the declaration that one is cause in the matter. It’s 
not a description of the case. It’s not a report on the facts: It’s a place to stand in life regarding 
what you care about. When I’m in India, I say the people who are hungry are responsible for 
their hunger. And the bleeding hearts have a problem with that. But I’ll tell you, if you are 
responsible for your hunger you’re a lot more powerful than if you’re a victim of being hungry. 
It’s quite clear to me that the hungry do not want to be hungry, and the hungry would not 
have it that way if they had the opportunity to do something about it. It’s quite clear to me that 
it takes more courage to live one day there than it takes for me to live ten years. But treating 
people as if they have no responsibility is disempowering to people. Now you can’t argue that 
you’re responsible, because that’s not a declaration, is it? That’s an assertion, an argument. A 
declaration has to be done freely, not coerced. You’ve got to have the power of declaration, and 
the power of declaration is a product of freedom. It’s a privilege to be responsible, not a burden 
to be responsible. “I am cause in the matter” is a stand for giving yourself power, not a report 
on the facts or the circumstances. It’s clear to me that I’m the cause in the matter of people’s 
hunger. I make that declaration; it gives me power with regard to the issue of hunger. It’s not a 
report on the fact that I did it. It’s a place to stand from which one has power. If it’s not my fault, 
if I didn’t do it—but none of that interests me—whose fault is it? Somebody gets to be wrong 
and somebody gets to be right. That’s the point. 
(indicating the “possibility” circle)
The realm of possibility is also the realm of responsibility. Most people are never going to be 
responsible because that realm doesn’t exist; you have to invent it. One of the things we haven’t 
told you is what you’re going to get out of being in The Forum. Listen up! What you’re going to 
get out of The Forum—yeah you’re going to get a lot of nice things and good things, but that’s 
all chicken shit. What you’re really going to get out of The Forum is whatever you’re willing to 
stand for having gotten out of The Forum. You’re not going to get out of The Forum what we 
gave you because we can’t give you anything of value. You know, all these people are not here 
because we have something valuable to give to people. You can’t get anything valuable from 
other people. Like “be given it.” Chicken shit is what we get from one another. But you can give 
yourself something valuable. You can give yourself something extraordinarily valuable. You 
can give yourself something that will last the rest of your life. You can give yourself something 
that will make it that your life is never the same. So here’s my promise: I promise that you can 
have anything out of The Forum you’re willing to stand for having gotten. I also promise you 
What you’re really going to get out of The
Forum is whatever you’re willing to stand for 
having gotten out of The Forum.

won’t get anything else out of The Forum that’s worth anything. What you’ll get out of your 
participation in The Forum is what you’re willing to stand for having gotten. You don’t get 
what you’re checking to see if you’ve gotten...” Let me see, what happened to me? Did my mind 
change? Did my feelings change? Did my eyesight change? Am I taller? Am I thinner? Do I 
feel better?” You can’t have any of that. If you’re willing to stand for having been empowered 
in here, you can walk out of here empowered. That’s the truth. This isn’t some airy-fairy crap. 
You are not the fi rst people I have done this work with. This is grounded on a lot of evidence. 
You paid your $625. You bust your ass for four days, you still got one evening to go. Whatever 
possibility you’re willing to stand for, whatever conversation for possibility you’re willing to 
generate, that’s what you will have gotten. Whatever possibility you’re willing to stand for, that’s 
what you can have. What you’ve done in here has given you the power to realize what you’re 
willing to stand for, not like a formula, but like a possibility in which you can act and be. Not 
like a guaranteed outcome, not like playing tennis with a three-year-old; being fully at risk, but 
being fully empowered in the face of the risk. If you don’t like risk, you don’t like life. So we’re 
up to the last thing now. Kind of. I say kind of because I never know what’s really last. Who has 
any questions?
A participant raised his hand.
RICHARD
I got what I paid my money for. What has happened in the last few months is that my projects 
have become so successful that they’re bigger than my possibility for them.
ERHARD
You hear what he said? He used up the world of possibility. The content has overwhelmed 
the context. He’s created a possibility and has related to that possibility powerfully enough, 
with the power to fulfi ll the possibility such that the content is overwhelming the context. 
You know what a hero is? Not what you think a hero is. A hero is not some dashing fi gure, an 
extraordinary person. Only ordinary people can be heroes. A hero is an ordinary person who 
dares to recognize and accept the call of a possibility bigger than themselves. Real simple. 
A hero is an ordinary person who sees, who hears, who is open to, and accepts the call of a 
possibility bigger than themselves, or herself or himself.
CECILIA
I’ve accomplished a lot and I’m an artist and illustrator. I’ve done book publishing, and so all 
this work is sixty percent solitary at least, and I’ve been having this conversation for years that 
I ought to go participate with other people. And so once and a while I go do that from “ought 
to.” I’ve done some good things but in the end I say “Jeez! That was a mistake. I wish I had done 
that by myself after all.” I mean the nurturing is kind of awful out here and I’ve been doing this 
work for years going in and out of that. And what I fi nally got these last four days was that it’s 
never going to work if I think I have to go and do it. It’s like “Gee, I already like this thing I’m 
doing: painting. It’s meaningless, so I’ll just do it!” But I also got that I had killed off  one of the 
main human attributes, which was love.

HENRY
I’m speaking and listening and it’s like the fi rst time. I’ve been stingy and this is the fi rst time 
that I’m not. I called my father and my mother. I told them that I loved them and they told me 
they loved me. I told them they were okay by me. My father said, “Well that’s interesting!” I 
asked him if I was okay by him and he said “Sure you’re okay by me.” My relationships with my 
mother and father are complete. I say so.
ERHARD
By the way: They are if you say so. Not like you want to say so. You’ve got to be free to say so. 
You can’t say so in-order-to. You’ve got to be standing where what you say is so. We’ll talk about 
that in a moment. Please go on.
HENRY
Everything that I’ve accomplished in my thirty-two years of my life is empty and meaningless. I’m 
okay with that. My life is perfect. What’s happened for me in the last several days is... I’m standing 
here trembling in awe and respect and gratitude for the incredible space of listening that you’ve 
created. I’m expressing myself for the fi rst time. The parts of The Forum that have been diffi  cult 
for me—I’m going through The Forum thinking I’m the only one going through this. But I’ve 
seen myself in everybody’s share and it hasn’t been diffi  cult or painful. It’s been great. I’ve gotten 
it: My back pain is gone, the stuff y nose is gone. I’ve got beyond the fi ve-year-old. I was that “I 
can’t remember beyond fi ve-years-old.” I don’t know whether I’m remembering what happened 
or remembering the story, but I’ve started to remember when I was very young. And what that 
frees up for me: I couldn’t own what was invisible to me. The racket, which came from incidents 
that were invisible to me and blocked out from me, kept coming up, and the incidents were so 
far back, way earlier than I’ve ever looked before. Even though I’ve done the training before, I’ve 
never experienced what I have now. I’ve always shared to look good, and now I’m sharing to 
contribute. I feel like the amount of time that people will listen to me is very short, and so I speak 
fast, cram it all in and nobody gets it. And I’m just worse off  afterwards. It was an in-order-to. 
ERHARD
Say what’s there instead of talking about it. I didn’t say, “say it fast,” I said “say what’s there.” 
You may have already said what you stood up to say, which is “I love you. And I respect you. 
And I acknowledge you.” If you’ve got something beyond that to say, say it. But get to the punch 
line. If you’re going to talk, do it eff ectively.
The Oblivion of Oblivion

important element in the understanding of Werner Erhard’s work 
that we are developing here. Dreyfus finds a useful summary of

I understand that. It says to me to be generous.

I’m not asking you to be generous. You will be generous if you do that. I’m not asking you to be 
generous, because that would mean for you to have a quality inside yourself called generous. 
If you act on the off er to have anything out of The Forum you are willing to stand for having 
gotten... if you act on the off er you will be being generous. Generosity arises in an act of being. 
It’s not a property inside of people that gets expressed in their actions. You get that?

WALT
I say I’m not confused about what you’ve given us in the last hour, but it is a lot to hold.
ERHARD
Yes, precisely, so listen up here. This is good. I read something to you three days ago and I want 
you to hear it again. See if it occurs for you diff erently than it did then.
Here, he read again the passage from the Heidegger/Japanese dialogue in Heidegger’s On the Way to 
Language.
ERHARD (reading)
“We Japanese do not think it strange if a dialogue leaves undefi ned what is really intended, or 
even restores it back to the keeping of the undefi nable.” ... “That is part of every dialogue that 
has turned out well among thinking beings. As if of its own accord it can take care that that 
undefi nable something not only does not slip away, but displays its gathering power ever more 
Stanley Kubrick’s film 2001, when he asked whether he is happy: 
“I’m using all my capacities to the maximum. What more could a 
rational entity want?” This, says Dreyfus, is “a brilliant expression 
of what anyone would say who is in touch with our current 
understanding of Being.”
Of particular relevance is Dreyfus’ observation that “the 
human potential movement perfectly expresses this technological 
understanding of Being” (“Gaining”). Werner Erhard’s work, which 
Peter Marin has called “the logical extension of the whole human 
potential movement” (“The New Narcissism,” Harper’s Magazine, 
October 1975, 47), may therefore be considered as a representative 
manifestation of our current technological understanding of 
Being, especially to the degree that this logical extension is 
itself, paradoxically, a denial of the so-called human potential 
movement. This point is central to the conclusion we are moving 
toward here.
The situation: humans are always subjected to understandings 
of Being, and to the way they play themselves out over time. In 
Dreyfus’ words, “We don’t produce the clearing; The clearing 
produces us” (“Gaining”). Every historical epoch is characterized 
by a particular mode of unconcealment, a particular way in which 
Being shows itself, so that in each epoch humans are given a 
particular way to be. Through this epochal self-revealing, this 
giving of itself to humans, Being manifests its nature; and beings 
show up being that way, “the way they wound up being,” as Erhard 
might say more recently. 
But as Western thought has evolved over time, human beings 
have lost their awareness of Being, if ever they have even been 
aware of Being. Now, of the giver-giving-given event that is Being’s 
gift , we see only the given, and we see it only as it is represented by 
beings. Being “withdraws in favor of the gift  which It gives” (OTB 8). 
When a giver withdraws and holds itself back, and gives only 
its gift , that giving is appropriately called sending (OTB 8). The 
gift  is given, but the sender, crucially, is not present. So while an 
experience of Being is no longer available, the sending continues 
to shape human existence in every age. This is the process which 
Heidegger calls the destining of Being, and from this destining

luminously in the course of the dialogue.” The Japanese inquirer said “Our dialogues with our 
teacher failed to turn out so well. Us younger men challenged him much too directly to satisfy 
our thirst for handy information.” ... “Thirst for knowledge and greed for explanations never 
lead to a thinking inquiry. Curiosity is always the concealed arrogance of a self-consciousness 
that banks on a self-invented rationality.” 
(to the group)
You remember I told you that that means we treat anything worth knowing as something 
that merely extends from what we already know and that if we don’t immediately understand 
something it must be bullshit. 
(continuing to read)
“The will to know does not will to abide in hope before what is worthy of thought.”
(to the group)
What you and I just spoke about in the last two hours is worth standing in front of. You may not 
get it all, which means you may not understand it all, which really means you may not be able 
to apply it all, and your applying it will only denigrate it anyhow. Much better to stand with it, 
to be with it.
WALT
So I’m way beyond what I understood before. I’m standing on a beach ball here, ready to lose 
my balance. But it’s a good place to be. I understood you to tell us that the forwarding of this is 
in declaration, that declaration is the way to access this? 
ERHARD
Declaration is the action out of which possibility is generated: the speech act out of which 
possibility is generated; it’s the name of the speech act out of which possibility arises.
WALT
So that’s what a person can do, in doing, to work with this.
ERHARD
Yeah, to generate a possibility. Precisely.
WALT
But the possibility, this possibility that’s created, is itself not useful, or applicable, but it sounds 
“opportunity” somehow gets created.
ERHARD
There’s an opening. A freedom. There’s a freedom for that which you have declared possible. It 
doesn’t mean you will—it means that there’s a freedom for that which you’ve declared possible, 
that your actions may arise inside that possibility, and that your actions will arise inside that 
possibility. We’re not done yet. We’ve got one last step to take.
“the essence of all history is determined” (“QCT” in BW 329). Here 
Dreyfus recounts the historical record:
In the Christian age, everything showed up as
God’s creation, and showed up in terms of its
nearness or distance from God’s own nature.
In the modern age, everything showed up as
either a subject with a deep essence, or an ob-
ject with fixed properties. In the technological
age, by contrast, everything shows up in light
of what will allow us to put it to “the greatest 
possible use at the lowest expenditure.” (Com-
panion to Heidegger 13)
“
Heidegger refers to this historical evolution of destining as the 
play of Being. Being holds itself back in a particular way in each 
epoch, and it is in the progress of the epochs that the play of Being 
is manifested. The order of that play defies human understanding 
and control: “The sequence of epochs in the destiny of Being is not 
accidental, nor can it be calculated as necessary” (OTB 9). It plays. 
Therefore enframing can be seen from one perspective as the 
essence of modern technology, while from another it is simply the 
particular clearing for unconcealment which the play of Being has 
sent at this moment in history.
At this point, the reader may notice herself thinking some 
version of “So what?” Yes, we can see the eff ects of technology 
in our world. We overuse our gadgets and texting while driving is 
dangerous and our interpersonal eye contact is suff ering. 
But at the same time global communication and the conveniences 
of everyday living have improved exponentially, and marginalized 
groups around the globe have found a voice through social media 
that have also shaken the foundations of local, national, and world 
politics. Every advance brings its challenges. We can deal with it.
Perhaps. Certainly, the advantages are undeniable. But the 
threat embedded in technology’s essence may make this one 
advance too far. With each development in the play of Being, we 
are moving farther and farther from the possibility of an originary 
experience of Being: “The epochs overlap each other in their

Okay. I’m just trying to handle the steps I’ve taken. 
ERHARD
You’re doing the right thing. Go ahead.
WALT
In the previous days here, I’ve been able to get outside of myself. The meaninglessness, and 
the meaninglessness of that, was a further push out of myself. And it’s an exciting place to be 
for action. I have a concern that this will just remain potential. And I want to use it as soon as 
possible so that it does not remain potential, or just a memory. 
ERHARD
Your actions will be consistent with it remaining a potential, and consistent with your avoiding 
that.
WALT
So I will not avoid that.
ERHARD
I don’t know. I just said your actions would be consistent with the occurring you created.

Relax. See, relax. All you got to do is be here. Real simple. All you got to do is be here. This stuff

But it’s too great just to let it sit.
ERHARD
No, it’s so great you’ve got to let it sit. All you’ve got to do is take a stand for anything you want 
to get out of The Forum. 
WALT
Yeah but me... get out of The Forum, it’s puny compared to what you’ve put on the board. 
ERHARD
I didn’t say “you,” like limiting it to you, like you, individually. “One can give...” Is that better?
sequence so that the original sending of Being as presence is more 
and more obscured in diff erent ways” (OTB 9). 
Therefore Heidegger makes his case in the strongest 
possible terms: it is not just that our technological way of being is 
distancing and impersonal. It is that once we lose ourselves in the 
system, we may not be able to find our way out. As the Cartesian 
subject, the self-certain lord of the earth, we encountered our 
subjective truth in every objective being. But enframed as 
resources for technology, “precisely nowhere does man today 
any longer encounter himself, i.e., his essence” (“QCT” in BW 332). 
We might begin to detect in Heidegger’s discourse the hint of a 
persistent complaint reaching a fever pitch:
Enframing does not simply endanger man in
his relationship to himself and to everything
that is. As a destining, it banishes man into the
kind of revealing that is an ordering. Where this
ordering holds sway, it drives out every other 
possibility of revealing. [. . .] 
The rule of enframing threatens man with the 
possibility that it could be denied to him to en-
ter into a more original revealing and hence to 
experience the call of a more primal truth. Thus
where enframing reigns, there is danger in the
highest sense. (“QCT” in BW 332–333)
“
The culmination: what has been lost is forgotten. 
Enframing disguises even this, its disguising, just
as the forgetting of something forgets itself and
is drawn away in the wake of forgetful oblivion. 
The coming-to-pass of oblivion not only lets fall
from remembrance into concealment; but that
falling itself falls simultaneously from remem-
brance into concealment, which itself also falls
away in that falling. (“TT” in QCT 46)

You have to free yourself, not limit yourself. You want to limit yourself: That’s what you want to

free inside the possibilities you create. You want to limit your actions to make sure you realize 
your goal. That is not this course. That’s a “Success” course.

So if I’m going to stay with it here, stay on board, really...

Give yourself some freedom. Create the possibility and then operate out of that possibility. 
Operate on what? Whatever the hell’s in front of you, do whatever you do. Stop complicating

prescription. You go left and then you go right, that’s how you get there; but the real way to

I was trying to address something else. I was trying to address what you put out there.
At this point, for Heidegger, we let slip our own essential 
role as the beings with meaning, the beings for whom Being is an 
issue, the clearing in the world for beings to be the beings they 
are. “Being’s coming to presence needs the coming to presence 
of man, in order to remain kept safe as Being. . .” (“TT” in QCT 38). 
But as enframing, we forfeit our role as safekeeper. Lost in the 
machinations of the cybernetic system, we not only let the truth of 
Being fall into oblivion, but we let fall into oblivion the knowledge 
that we have done so, until finally, oblivion itself is forgotten, 
and we forget that anything has been lost. “The most profound 
oblivion,” says Heidegger, “is not-recollecting” (EP 63).
As evidence that this is already the condition in our world, we 
cite the diff iculty that is inevitably encountered in any discussion 
of Being, for example, the recurring sense in reading this book of 
“What the hell are we talking about?” Being in our time, so goes 
Heidegger’s persistent complaint, cannot be recollected, let alone 
spoken. ■

ERHARD
You’re trying to address what I put out there using your approach. And you need a little bit of 
your approach. But we don’t need to discuss that; you’ll come up with that with your genius 
in that quarter. You don’t need to discuss that with me. What you need to do is create the 
possibility and to let yourself be free in the possibility. All the rest of it you’re thrown to.
 
WALT
Okay, so create the possibility.
ERHARD
Yeah, that’s what I said. You can have anything out of The Forum you can stand for having 
gotten. “Stand for having gotten” and “create the possibility” are synonymous.
WALT
And that’s the declaration.
ERHARD
Yeah. That’s: generate a conversation for. 
WALT
So if I don’t screw with that, it’s going to be all right.
ERHARD
Yeah, just handle that... No, I don’t know whether it’s going to be all right. All I know is that 
you’re going to have power in the face of the risk that life is. That’s all I promised you. I didn’t 
promise you things would be all right. I promised you the power and ability. I don’t know about 
all right.
WALT
Thanks, Werner.
ERHARD
Yes, you’re welcome.

Bill? Stand up.
Bill stood, the participant from the chocolate/vanilla demonstration, who also confronted Erhard on

BILL
I don’t really have anything to discuss that I am confused about, but it’s what has set me free 
that makes me feel a lot better about my experience here. For one thing, I want to thank you 
Werner for tolerating my controlling nature. 
ERHARD
Yeah, and you and I needed to tolerate each other for it to work and so I want to thank you for 
tolerating my controlling nature, too. 
BILL (to laughter)
I came in this Forum with somewhat of a chip on my shoulder, 
(laughter)
...and I was kind of angry. I had a lot of rackets that I couldn’t see until many of you stood up to 
discuss them.
ERHARD (to the group)
This is called being big. This is called magnanimous. And it’s not that he is that. He gives 
himself that in this action. 
BILL
Anyway, I found that for myself I have a tendency to try to analyze behavior and try to explain 
things on my terms in order for me to be in a controlling advantage. I don’t like to be controlled 
at all. And at fi rst I felt like I was being controlled.
ERHARD
The word’s “dominated.”
BILL
Exactly. But what I was shown is that I can’t empower anybody. I lose love, lose self-expression, 
and I lose freedom.
ERHARD
And you lose power. When you dominate you lose power. Love is power. Happiness is power. 
Self-expression is power. Power is having your self realized in the world. That’s power. 
BILL
Right. I fi nd that through letting that controlling element go and accepting myself for the way 
I am, recognizing that I’m always already being that way, and yet being able to accept myself 
more, and it was especially a release to fi nd out that things I was putting a contingency on: My 
happiness is not contingent upon anything. 
ERHARD
That’s right. We’re about to talk about your happiness. You’re in the right place. Keep going.

BILL
For a great part of my life I’ve been doing things in-order-to. Very often in-order-to. I changed 
jobs in-order-to; I got a college degree in-order-to. Everything I’ve done has been in-order-to. 
I’ve been searching a lot to fi nd out how to be happy just being. And coming here is a... I want 
to thank the people who compelled me to be here. Well, infl uenced me, empowered me...
ERHARD
People pressured you into being here. I understand. Go on. 
(laughter)
BILL
They empowered me and they were very magnanimous in doing so. I recognize now that there’s 
a lot of joy in just being. 
ERHARD (to the group) 
You want to hear that. You don’t want to listen to that like it’s some kind of platitude. Listen 
to it like it’s a possibility into which to live your life. Joy in just being. That’s diff erent than 
running your racket just being.
BILL
I came here with a lot of things on the line. 
(holding back tears)
I had a brother who lived with me who was just killed in an automobile accident, and... 
ERHARD
And that’s sad. Authentically so.
BILL
Yes.
ERHARD
Not racketedly so. Racketedly so it’s bullshit. Authentically it’s sad—to lose your brother.
BILL
But the way I was responding to it was I wanted to get out of my immediate environment and, 
as I said, I’ve always been putting reasons and contingencies on every move in my life.
ERHARD
Hold on for a second. We’ve gotten a lot of people up here so you could see yourself. And a 
lot of that was hard to see. Seeing some of the bullshit you are is hard to see. Now you got 
a guy being the other end of the spectrum. A guy standing up being possibility. Start seeing 
yourself there too. I don’t hear Bill giving a report. I hear Bill making a declaration. I hear

SPEAKING BEING
Bill standing for what he got out of his participation in The Forum. Bill’s making all this 
up. There’s not one bit of it that’s not made up. Just like when the umpire says “strike”: It’s 
a strike because he said so. It’s not a report on the man’s internal state. That’s not the way 
I listen it. I listen him declaring himself, saying who he is in the matter of his participation 
in The Forum.
BILL
I had called a friend that I had told I was moving to Germany. I had lived there previously and 
was looking forward to it. My experience is not that I am going there because of anything: I get 
now that I choose to go there. 
ERHARD
Do you understand that’s just a way of speaking? But it’s not mere semantics as you would 
call it. “I’m going there because I’ve chosen to go there.” It’s just a way of speaking. He could 
say that he’s going there because he already made the commitment, or that it would be 
inconvenient to get out of going there. Or I made the commitment when I wanted to get away 
from being reminded that my brother died. Which one is empowering? Which one’s going to 
give Bill the most power? The most freedom to be?
BILL
I’d like to in the future use this experience to make choices for myself and not blame them 
on circumstances, and take complete responsibility for my life, and to experience the joy of 
each day, every day of my life: to look forward to each day with a possibility; to not have my 
happiness contingent upon anything I create or anything that I want in life. This is really giving 
me the framework for, the context...
ERHARD
Because you said so. It is because he said so. When he stops saying so it won’t be. Brilliant, Bill. 
Absolutely brilliant. Thank you for your generosity.
(applause)
(to the group)
The last step is the answer to the question, why can’t you say “I love you” to somebody? Because 
you’re too sincere to do that. And you won’t say “I love you” to somebody unless you really feel 
it, will you? I mean, that would be terrible, wouldn’t it? Saying “I love you” to people you didn’t 
feel love for, that would be insincere, wouldn’t it? That’s true insincerity. Saying “I love you” 
to people you don’t feel love for. That would be insincerity, right? That’s my proof for: You are 
your feelings. You get that? I just proved to you that you are your feelings. See, what you say isn’t 
insincere unless it’s an expression of your feelings. Which means you are that over which you’ve 
got no dominion. That’s what you are... I’m accusing you of being your feelings. I’m accusing 
you of being something over which you have nothing to say. I’m accusing you of being sincere, 
which I fi nd disgusting, because that’s what sincere is, sincere is identifying with the way you

feel and the way you think, and the way you see things, about which you’ve got nothing to say. 
Nothing. In fact the way you see things has to do with the way you were when you were a little 
girl or a little boy. Anybody not clear about that? I say you can’t say “I love you” to somebody 
without checking your feelings, because if you say “I love you” to somebody and you didn’t 
feel like it, that would be insincere, inauthentic for you; because your love is an expression of 
your feelings. Who you are is your feelings. Who you are is your internal state. Anybody not 
clear about the accusation? Good. Now I want to talk to you about a possibility beyond that 
accusation, which arises in getting clear about the accusation. Anybody want to tell me they’re 
not clear about the accusation now that they know what the consequences are? Stand up. 
RALPH
Can you repeat the accusation?
ERHARD
Sure. I said you can’t say “I love you” to a guy you don’t know—you can’t walk up to someone 
you don’t know and say “I love you,” because it’s not true! It’s just a bunch of words. Unless 
you feel love for somebody you can’t say “I love you” and have it be authentic. I say that that’s 
incontrovertible, clear cut evidence that you are your feelings. That’s who you are. You are your 
internal state: your feelings, and your thoughts, and your attitudes. That’s who you are.
RALPH
Because you can say “I love you” without authenticity...
ERHARD
Because you can’t say “I love you” without feeling it.
RALPH
And be authentic.
ERHARD
And be authentic. Precisely. But when you say “authentic,” you mean say yourself “honestly,” 
right?
RALPH
Yes.
ERHARD
And if you say “I love you” to somebody and you don’t feel it, that’s not saying yourself 
honestly. Therefore it must be true that you are your feelings.
RALPH
That’s where I miss it. It’s that connection I miss.
Transformation as Technology
In the face of this subjection to the technological way of Being, 
what is there for us to do? Certainly, any action can never have as 
its objective the “mastery” of technology. “That would mean, aft er 
all, that man was the master of Being” (“TT” in QCT 38). Besides, as 
Dreyfus observes, the more we try to master technolo gy, the more

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Look. I say “I love you.” But it’s just a bunch of words, because I don’t feel it. 
RALPH
But when you say “I love you” and you feel it, I don’t understand why that means I am my 
feelings.
ERHARD
Because you can’t say “I love you” without feeling it.
RALPH
So who you are is just the state of what is true for you, whatever that state is. Feelings or not 
feelings. When they are there.
ERHARD
When they’re not there, then it’s not there.
RALPH
Then who you say you are is a lie. So who you are is your feelings, only when who you are, who 
you are saying who you are is really the feeling.
ERHARD
No, you got it too complex. This has to do with thinking. Listen: “I assert that you are your 
feelings.” And you should say “Okay, I heard your assertion; what evidence do you have to 
validate that assertion?” Then I say, “My evidence is: When you say ‘I love you’ to somebody, it’s 
not authentic for you unless you feel it—hence the evidence there validating my assertion that 
you are your feelings. Because the ‘I’ which you’re speaking is your feelings or it’s not authentic. 
‘I love you’: ‘I’ refers to my feelings.”
RALPH
I got it.
ERHARD
Thank you. I assert “you are your feelings.” And my evidence for that assertion is you can’t 
say “I love you” to somebody and have it be authentic if you don’t feel it. What you mean by 
“I” is feeling. “Feeling loves you. And I am my feelings, therefore I can say ‘I love you’ if I feel 
it. Because ‘I’ and feeling are one. I am my feelings.” This is the age of sincerity. In an age of 
sincerity people identify with their feelings—I don’t like “identify” because it’s a psychological 
term and this is an ontological conversation. So I don’t say people identify with their feelings, I 
say “you are your feelings,” and their mood, and their attitude, and their state of mind, and the 
way they see things, and what they believe in—“believe” being something like feeling it, seeing 
it. You don’t have a special “believe” organ. “Believe” is constituted of perceptions and thinking 
and feeling. So I’m accusing you of being your internal state. You are your internal state because 
this is the age of sincerity. In an age of sincerity, what you meant is what’s really important. 
technological we become (“Gaining”). During his conversation with 
Jacob in Session Three of Day Three, Erhard said, “The attempt to 
get out of the trap constricts the bars of the prison. The attempt to 
get beyond the ‘this-is-all-there-is’ keeps you in the trap. Trying to 
get out of the prison keeps you in the prison. And not trying to get 
out of the prison keeps you in the prison.” 
Having sounded the alarm, Heidegger has a suggestion—not 
an answer, but a hint, which also is echoed in Erhard’s technology 
of transformation in the distinction “getting off  it,” where we are 
no longer constrained to entertain a given way of Being (an already 
and always way of listening). “In the normal course of events,” 
said Erhard in Session Five of Day One, “if I found out my already 
always listening was disempowering I would try to stop it. He [the 
participant in dialogue with Erhard] didn’t change it. That’s the big 
secret. Because when you change it, nothing changes.” Heidegger’s 
suggestion comes from these lines from the German poet 
Hölderlin: “But where danger is, grows/The saving power also” 
(“QCT” in BW 333). That is, at its root, technology’s danger is at the 
same time Being’s gift . Therefore, Heidegger asks, “might not an 
adequate look into what enframing is, as a destining of revealing, 
bring the upsurgence of the saving power into appearance?” 
(“QCT” in BW 334). Here, he specifies the conditions for such an 
upsurgence: 
Because the essence of technology is nothing
technological, essential reflection upon tech-
nology and decisive confrontation with it must
happen in a realm that is, on the one hand, akin
to the essence of technology, and, on the other,
fundamentally diff erent from it. (“QCT” in
BW 340)
“
Being given by the technological way of Being, swept up into the 
in-order-to, we cannot but be given entirely by “its” aims. We 
don’t run it; it runs us. But appropriating this lostness there at the 
precipice that Nothing brings us to face, at the very moment we 
can be in the trap of the in-order-to, the saving power surges up. 
That is Erhard’s technology of transformation.

For example, if I really meant to do it, that’s just as good for you as if I did it. You can’t even 
tell the diff erence. You don’t relate to people out of what they produce, you relate to people out 
of their sincerity. No shit. So. There’s another possibility. And the other possibility is an Age 
of Integrity. That’s diff erent than the age of sincerity. In the age of integrity you are your word. 
Real simple. You just got clear that who you are is your feelings, your attitudes, your states of 
mind, your internal state. In the age of integrity you are your word. That means you honor your 
word as yourself. You’ve got to get that, because if you don’t you won’t get the rest of what I’m 
going to say. You’ve got to get it abstractly. Not conceptually, but just the way I say it. You’ve got 
to create the possibility of actually being your word. Not the idea of being your word. Not the 
option of being my word. I am my word. I’ve got feelings, and I’ve got thoughts and attitudes 
and a state of mind, and I have a hand. I am not my hand. I take care of my hand, I enjoy my 
hand, I celebrate my hand, but I’m not my hand. And I have feelings. I take care of my feelings, 
I enjoy my feelings, I celebrate my feelings, but I’m not my feelings, or my states of mind, or 
my moods any more than I’m my hand. In an age of integrity you would be your word and you 
would honor your word as your self: You wouldn’t honor your feelings as your self, you would 
honor your word as your self. You would be your word and you would have feelings. Not be 
your feelings. You be you word and have feelings like you have a hand. You would have feelings, 
and have thoughts, and have an attitude, and have a state of mind, and you wouldn’t be that. So 
instead of your life being shaped by your thoughts and feelings and attitudes, your life would 
be shaped by your word. Because your word would be the context in which the world occurs, 
and your feelings and your actions and your thoughts would be a correlate of an occurring that 
arose in a world created by your word. So you would be able to love somebody just by saying so. 
See, if I am my word and I say “I love you,” I love you. And it’s got power that your feelings will 
never have. No diff erent than feeling “I love you.” See, if who you are is feeling, feeling “I love 
you” is the same as if who you are is your word saying “I love you.” The same except that being 
your feelings will never have the power that being your word has, because you’ve got something 
to say about your word, and ain’t got shit to say about what you feel. When you start to honor 
your word as yourself, live as your word, be your word, I don’t mean some silly moral horseshit 
about keeping your word. You see this is only a possibility: You can’t struggle toward this; you 
can’t set this up as a goal; you can’t try to achieve this; you can’t pray for this. You’ve got to 
live in the possibility of this, because that’s the only way it will work. To live in the possibility, 
to live from the possibility of being your word, and having your feelings, and your thoughts, 
and your state of mind, and having your attitude, et cetera. It gives you power to love people, 
rather than have love for them. It makes your word kind of sacred, and it gives you access to 
the sacred. Being happy is a sacred state. See, if you are your word, you can say “I am happy” 
and you are happy. And it ain’t a bunch of fucking words: It’s your self. It’s no diff erent than 
reporting on your internal state. If what you are is your internal state, then to say “I’m happy,” 
you’ve got to have an internal state called happy. But if you’re your word, you’re happy because 
you say you’re happy: I am happy.” Your feelings and your attitudes and your state of mind and 
your thoughts and your hand start to line up with your word. I don’t assess my feelings. I don’t 
address my feelings to fi nd out who I am. I don’t look at my hand to fi nd out who I am either. I 
also don’t look at my nose or my feet to fi nd out who I am. I don’t look at my feelings to fi nd out 
who I am. And my hand lines up with who I am and so do my feelings, and so do my thoughts. 
So I’m leaving you at this juncture of The Forum with the possibility of honoring your word as 
ERHARD (continuing)
In an age of integrity you would be your word 
and you would honor your word as your self:
You wouldn’t honor your feelings as your self,
you would honor your word as your self. You 
would be your word and you would have feel-
ings. Not be your feelings. You be you word and
have feelings like you have a hand. You would
have feelings, and have thoughts, and have
an attitude, and have a state of mind, and you 
wouldn’t be that. So instead of your life being
shaped by your thoughts and feelings and atti-
tudes, your life would be shaped by your word.

If I gave everyone in the room who’s awake an opportunity to speak, we would all thank each 
other. The other people who participated in The Forum gave you an enormous gift, one of great 
generosity and magnanimity. You did not pay for The Forum. You did not. The Forum you just 
participated in was a gift from the people who assisted here—to you. Not to you as a personality 
because they didn’t know you personally. It was a gift to the possibility that you are. This thing 
wouldn’t exist without them. There were one hundred and twenty to one hundred and thirty 
people who volunteered their time and their intelligence and their ability and their energy 
and their humanity so that we could do this Forum together. They got here before you or I did, 
and were here after you and I left. You wouldn’t have even gotten enrolled if it weren’t for the 
assistants. And you know the kind of courage it took to enroll you. And the deep profound 
humanity that it took to put up with your shit. So I wanted to give you an opportunity to 
acknowledge the assistants.

Thirty-three staff  members of WE&A from diff erent centers put this together. If you get a 
chance to be around staff  members, I recommend that you take that opportunity. Something 
rubs off . You know, they are ordinary people like you and me. They’re not something 
extraordinary. But what they’ve chosen to do with their lives... what gives you your life—listen 
up—what gives you your life gives you: you. And what they’ve chosen to do with their lives 
gives them something, and you ought to get some of that. And the way to get some of that is 
be around them. One of the things you can do is nurture them and support them. That’d be all 
right. The other thing you could do is assist with them. Hang out and watch them. I’d like to 
give us an opportunity to acknowledge those thirty-three staff  members who created this Forum

went to school, and got an award for something I wrote, and the best thing I wrote was about

Forum Day Four: Session Three 523
my experience in church. But let me tell you something: I’ve never had the kind of experience 
with church like I’ve had at the service I’m inviting you to. It’s extraordinary. Whatever your 
experience has been, I promise this is worth doing, and I’m not hustling you to go to church, or 
I am, whatever you like. The last thing for me: Be at one of the seven evening sessions and get 
all that shit out of your head about my reasons for asking you. The other thing is that there is 
a lot of talk about me, and most of it is bullshit. I’m not worth all that talk, but there are some 
things I am worth.
Here Erhard told a story about an “award” he had received from a professor of English at the 
University of New Delhi—a Professor Manmohan—who had traveled with him in India. Normally, 
Manmohan was very quiet. But when he’d talk with Erhard about Erhard’s work, he’d always ask 
when Erhard was going to bring it to India.
ERHARD
Eventually we did do the work in India, and Manmohan had participated in the fi rst program 
we did. One of the things he got, he got the possibility of an extraordinary relationship with 
his father. Manmohan had a good relationship with his father, but particularly in the Indian 
culture, it doesn’t matter how old you are, you are always your father’s son. Manmohan took the 
train back to his father’s village and they sat and talked for hours, and they cried together, and 
everything was wonderful, and opened up, and all that stuff . And Manmohan said, “Werner, my 
father asked me ‘Son, what happened to you?’ And he told him about the work, and his father 
said, ‘Oh, I understand, son: you found a guru.’” By the way, “you found a guru” is not an insult 
in Indian culture. In this country it’s an insult. You’re in good shape if you found your guru in 
India. Manmohan said to me, “You know Werner, I had to think about it, because I had just 
fi nished being really straight with my father, and I really wanted to be straight with him and 
answer his question. I told my father ‘No, father, I didn’t fi nd a guru. I found a friend.’” That’s 
the most important award I’ve ever gotten. It’s the only one I want. And what I can promise you 
is that I am your friend and I will always be here for you. I’ll always be for the possibility you 
are, and if I never see you again, I’ll still be your friend for the rest of our time. So, if somebody 
asks you: “You went to The Forum with Werner, who’s he?” You say “He’s a friend of mine” and 
you’ll be telling them the truth. Thank you very much, and good night.
Erhard left the room through the opening in the curtains at the back of the platform, to a standing 
ovation.

There are three woman in my life who are here, and I am madly in love with each of them: 
my mother, my future mother-in-law, and my fi ancée. These three women stand for me, no

of this work, and I’ve been participating for a while, I know my relationship with Becky will

really just out of our commitment, and our stand together, the possibility of this work and the 
diff erence we can make, just like giving it away. And I just really want to say to you three that I 
love you, and thanks!

Forum Day Four: Session Three 525
BERNICE (very moved)
This is the fi rst time I’ve gotten up to share. I don’t know if I can make it without crying. I want 
to acknowledge someone I haven’t acknowledged in about ten years of my life. And that’s my 
brother. I love you. He introduced me to The Forum and I fought him every step of the way. One 
of my rackets is that people are setting me up to fail, and I had thought: “If you set me up here, 
I will never forgive you!”
(laughter)
But you have given me more with this Forum, than I’ve ever gotten from anyone in my life. And 
I love you so much. I also want to acknowledge and thank Jane. Everything she said, I felt so 
deeply, and there are no words to describe my gratitude. But, I just want to say, I think you are a 
truly beautiful person, you have the courage to stand up and tell people, and I owe you for that. 
Thank you.
KIPP (to applause)
Very well said!
VICTOR
I don’t know where they are in the room but my brother and my mother are here and I take my 
hat off  to you, and I want to say that I love the both of you. You are my family, and are pretty 
much the most important thing in my life. I thank you for giving me the chance to see who I 
was, who the hell I really was. I love you. And I thank all the people that shared. I saw a little of 
my self in each and every one of you. And now I know who that is and I have to accept and be 
with that I’m a human being.
KIPP (to applause)
Well said! Thank you!
MIC
This is the fi rst time I’ve gotten up to share, and I was pretty sure I’d get through the whole 
Forum without having to. I want to thank the people who I’ve had conversations with, each 
one is an exceptional person. And I want to thank my girlfriend, who was the fi rst person to 
introduce me to The Forum and basically put up with all my shit. I just want to say thank you, 
and I love you, and I will tell you that in private, but right now I want everyone to hear that 
also. I love you.
KIPP
Beautiful!
ROB
I didn’t expect you to call on me! I did est back in 1974, and it was great. A lot of things 
happened in between, and everybody has said what I want to say. I just feel at a loss for words. I 
want to express my gratitude for you Kipp. When you fi rst came out, I thought, “who is this?”

KIPP (to laughter)
That’s what I thought when I fi rst came out.
ROB
After the second session, I was “this guy’s incredible.” Even though I’ve only talked to a few of 
you here, I love you all. I love who you are and I love who I am. I am comfortable in my own 
presence. Thank you!
KIPP
Thank you very much.
STEPHAN (wearing clerical attire)
I want to thank you Kipp, Wes, and Werner, of course, but you and Wes in a very special way, 
because you were with me in a very special way. I’ve been complete with my parents and my 
sister, who are dead now. And the completion I got is a great joy. And now out of this I get to 
pray to my parents. They are now with me, to empower me. That’s an immense gift. The other 
gift I want to acknowledge for you out of the whole process of the empty and meaningless and 
being down in the shadow of the Valley of Death, you know, that’s our territory...
(laughter)
I want you to know that I put on my meaning suit. This is a meaning suit, full of meaning. 
What I want to thank you for is being able to live again my priesthood. And I declare that I am a 
renewed priest, and available for the transformation of people everywhere, the people especially 
who are in religion, and if I can be selfi sh, in my own church, but for all people. God bless you 
and thank you for that.
KIPP (to applause)
Thank you very much!
(walking back up to the platform)
So, in the interest of sleep, we’ll go on and what I’d like to get created a little bit for you is 
our Forum Evening Sessions coming up next week. And The Forum Evening Sessions are 
designed to complete The Forum, and there are two aspects of the completion of The Forum. 
One of the aspects is contributing this. As many of you said since being here, it took a lot to 
get you here, and it’s now an opportunity for you to contribute the possibility of The Forum in 
everybody’s life in your life. That’s one aspect of The Forum Evening Session. And the other 
aspect of The Forum Evening Session is designed to create the third part of The Forum. The 
fi rst part is about unconcealing the being of human being. The second part is about creating the 
possibility of being for human being, and the third part of The Forum is discovering your life as 
a commitment to possibility. So The Forum Evening Session could be said to be about the rest of 
your life. And it really is the completion of that.

Forum Day Four: Session Three 527
Kipp proceeded to review the logistics and procedure of the evening, including a play-by-play 
recounting of what will happen, including having an opportunity to share during the evening 
session, right at the beginning, when The Forum Leader presents the opportunity to share.
KIPP (continuing)
...and I invite you to not hold back, to create for yourself and the people that you have there, 
having possibility in your life and in their lives... Now, I’m going to tell you everything you 
need to know to share The Forum eff ectively and have your friends and family do The Forum. 
It’s very simple and it’s very straightforward. So if you’re committed to sharing The Forum 
and having people at your Forum Evening Session and having them register, the fi rst thing 
is this: Do not sell The Forum. Simply be straight with the people in your lives. Say whatever 
The Forum is for you. Whether you think it’s great or whether you’re not sure, whether you’re 
confused, or if you think it was stupid, or whether you are totally enthusiastic with a thousand 
breakthroughs. Whatever it truly is for you, authentically share that. Don’t sell The Forum. 
Because what people listen to is not what you say. People listen to who you are being. The 
second thing is, it serves the people who you are bringing for them to know there will be an 
opportunity for them to register, so they should bring their schedules... and they should bring 
money with them. Be straight with people. That’s what works. The last thing is this: When you 
walk out of here and share The Forum, that is, share your self, you will be speaking into the 
listening of the world. You already know what that listening is. When you share yourself, people 
will think it’s a racket, it’s a cult... When you speak, people will have those thoughts. Everybody 
clear? People will have those thoughts.
(Kipp grabs a tissue and holds it up; laughter)
Don’t get stuck with their thoughts. Don’t get stuck with your own. What there is to do is 
simple. Okay?
Kipp grabbed the dictionary from a table on the platform, and he asked a participant to stand up on 
the stage with him.
KIPP (addressing the participant)
When sharing The Forum with anyone, what’s the worst thing they could say to you?
ED
“I think you’re stupid and weird.”
KIPP
So this dictionary represents “I think you’re stupid and weird.” Resist it.
Kipp light-heartedly attacks Ed over and over with the dictionary repeating “I think you’re stupid 
and weird” with each attack, and Ed defl ects each attack with upraised hands.
KIPP (to the group)
For the most part that’s what you call communication.

(laughter)
Here is what to do when people say that stuff  to you.
(to Ed)
This time take the dictionary.
(as Kipp attacks once more)
“I think you’re stupid and weird.”
(Ed takes the dictionary away)
That’s your job. So when people say that stuff , your job is to be with them. Chocolate: choose. 
When you get a whole big pile of dictionaries, we turn around and put them down, and say, 
what else you got? Peacocks are these gorgeous birds. Do you know what peacocks eat? They 
eat poison off  the ground. If you want to make a diff erence in people’s lives, you’ve got to be 
willing to eat their poison. Thank you Ed.
(Ed sits to applause)
And, you’re going to get stuck with some dictionaries. You’re going to notice in the middle of 
a conversation with somebody, all of a sudden, you’ll be resisting what they are saying. You 
notice that in the middle of a conversation, you can say, “I got hooked. Here’s what I want to 
say.” I invite you not to stop. You can make a real contribution to the people in your lives this 
weekend. Another thing: Whatever emergencies come up for you, whatever can normally stop 
you in life, don’t get stopped. Be at your Forum Evening Session, and complete The Forum for 
yourself.

in order to speak a language which communicates Being, one must speak from an 
ontological location, a clearing, which provides access to Being.
The second question asks: how does the dialogic rhetorical structure of The 
Forum achieve ontological transformation?
The Forum as an instance of ontological rhetoric—that is, rhetoric which 
communicates strategically so as to produce a shift in its audience’s way of Being.
What are the central functional characteristics of ontological rhetoric, as they
have been developed in this book? Fundamental to ontological rhetoric is the 
communication of an unsaid element of language. That is, both Heidegger and
d
Erhard hold that Being is a region or horizon which pervades and contextualizes 
language, but which cannot itself be articulated. Nevertheless, while Being must
remain unspoken, it can nevertheless be brought to presence by means of a certain 
kind of speaking; Heidegger proposed that a dialogue which is conducted in a
certain way can function to bring Being to presence for dialogic partners. Therefore, 
The Forum is an attempt to design and enact a dialogue which brings Being to
presence as an unspoken element of a spoken conversation.
In order for Being to be brought to presence, an ontological shift must occur, a 
t
transformation in the way human beings conceive themselves. According to Heidegger, 
the presence of Being requires a clearing; in our current way of thinking and being,
however, the clearing which human beings are is obscured by the normative self-
structure which we call identity, or the “they” self and its current technological 
way of Being. Therefore, much of The Forum is devoted to the deconstruction of 
identity and its in-order-to, so that participants can begin to see themselves as a
different ontological entity: a clearing for Being from which it becomes possible to
appropriate one’s inauthenticity. Furthermore, from this event new possibilities
for Being arise, and as they are languaged, the world as it occurs transforms and 
takes us along with it. This process of ontological deconstruction and invention is 
posited in The Forum as a process that occurs entirely in language: The Forum is 
a dialogic enactment of Heidegger’s thesis that “language is the house of Being.” 
It creates the conditions for ontological transformation by engaging participants
in the speaking of a new language, a language grounded in certain ontological
assumptions (Erhard’s distinctions, the figures of speech and thought which
comprise his technology of transformation). During the four days of this 1989 Forum, 
as participants engage in the dialogue and speak its language, they gradually come 
to dwell in the ontological assumptions in which that language of distinctions is
grounded, ontological assumptions which have become available as an unsaid
element of the dialogue, and which produce the ontological shift which is The
Forum’s goal.
END OF DAY FOUR INTERVAL
CONCLUSION
Technology of Transformation
Two fundamental questions have guided our inquiry that has, at last, brought us 
to bring to language Erhard’s technology of transformation as we have witnessed 
it in the dialogue of The Forum and in our ruminations that have brought Heideg-
ger’s and Erhard’s thinking face-to-face: What are the foundations of Erhard’s rhetor-
ical and ontological rhetoric? How does the dialogic rhetorical structure of The Forum 
achieve ontological transformation?
First, what are the foundations of Erhard’s rhetorical and ontological rhetoric?
We have sought to show that both Heidegger’s philosophy and Erhard’s
rhetoric are founded upon the existence and nature of what Heidegger calls the 
ontological difference, the difference between beings and Being. Both projects
attempt to span this difference and to develop a language through which beings can 
speak and communicate Being. The Forum may be seen as the practical, rhetorical 
development of Heidegger’s thought in this area; Erhard appears to have taken 
certain difficult Heideggerian ideas and made them accessible in a profound way.
It is not our thesis, however, that Heidegger’s thought is foundational
t
to Erhard’s work as a whole. According to Erhard, his project was generated
by an experience of ontological transformation which he underwent in 1971;
his subsequent work has been an evolving attempt to communicate that
transformation experience. His use of Heideggerian terms and concepts in this effort 
began just a few years prior to the time The Forum replaced the est Training in 1985,
t
and indeed, it may be argued that this encounter was crucial in this development
of Erhard’s work, which development continues to this day in Landmark Worldwide 
and in his new work with speaking the Being of leadership. In any event, while 
drawing upon Heidegger’s ontological language to express his own transformation, 
Erhard has simultaneously extended the communicative possibilities of that 
Heideggerian language. That is, he has shown how a dialogue with Being might look
in lived experience and what its effect might be for those who participate in such an
unfolding ontological dialogue.
Thus the foundation of Erhard’s rhetoric may be seen to be its relationship with
Being, and that where ontological language speaks from determines its power: that

=== PAGE 545 ===

Forum Day Four: End of Day Four Interval 531
The strategic dialogue in which this process occurs is from time to time 
characterized by aggressiveness and intrusiveness on Erhard’s part, and by frequent 
resistance on the part of his dialogic partners. Heidegger has pointed out that 
any attempt to analyze Being constantly has the character of doing violence to
the complacency of the everyday interpretation. Thus what occurs in The Forum 
is the violation of the everyday interpretation, as identity (the “they” self) is
deconstructed and Being is wrested from unconcealment. In the process, Erhard’s
rhetoric sometimes seems intrusive, and the dialogue which it stimulates is often 
combative; yet during the four days of The Forum the results of the dialogue are 
dramatic.
Central to Erhard’s achievement is his rhetorical development of two 
Heideggerian ideas. The first is the complex and elusive notion of appropriation, 
which addresses the central paradox of the being-Being relationship: that human 
beings can attain ontological freedom only by recognizing and allowing their 
fundamental subservience to the play of Being. The second is the encounter with
the Nothing, the emptiness and meaningless correlative to the mood of anxiety. 
Both of these ideas are communicated, in The Forum’s persistent and reiterative
ontological rhetoric, so that they can be apprehended as ontological insights:
that is, so that they produce a result in the participants’ way of Being by virtue of 
discovering it for themselves, rather than simply being understood conceptually. 
Through the reiterated dialogic communication of these ontological insights, 
participants in The Forum’s dialogue come increasingly to dwell in the ontological
assumptions given by those insights, and then act in their lives with freedom to be
in the very circumstances that would otherwise appear as constraints.
Embedded in both of these Heideggerian ideas, and basic to The Forum’s 
ontological rhetoric, is the figure of reflexivity. That is, for both Heidegger and 
Erhard, what is necessary for the creation of a clearing for Being is that human 
beings turn around and see themselves as they are. Thus The Forum is fundamentally 
the enactment of a reflexive turn, a rhetorical figure par excellence: participants in 
The Forum, by virtue of its technology of transformation, speak a language designed
to reveal them as they are, so that what may be simultaneously revealed, within and 
beyond the way they are, is their own largest possibility.
We conclude that Erhard’s work is both a manifestation of the metaphysical/
technological tradition and a new appropriation of that tradition. Therefore, on the 
Heideggerian view, it is an appropriate venue for a reflexive thinking which can step 
back, and in taking such a step, to reach beyond the current technological paradigm
by reaching through that paradigm. The technology of The Forum is putting-into-
use putting itself to use in order to turn and see itself face-to-face. It is calculative, 
technological thinking calculating its own deconstruction, reflexion radicalized
for the appropriation of its own essential nature. As a dialogic, rhetorical project,
it extends the communicative possibilities of Heidegger’s thinking, and makes the 
event of appropriation, and the freeing release which it occasions, available to an 
audience which Heidegger’s work is likely never to reach.

AFTERWORD
WERNER ERHARD, 
MARTIN HEIDEGGER, A N D 
THE POLITICS OF BEING
By Michael E. Zimmerman
Michael E. Zimmerman was a philosophy professor at Tulane University and the University of 
Colorado at Boulder before retiring in 2015. Author of four books, and more than a hundred
articles and book chapters, Zimmerman’s research interests include environmental philosophy, 
Heidegger, Nietzsche, Buddhism, and integral theory. His books include Eclipse of the Self (1981),
Heidegger’s Confrontation with Modernity (1990),
y
Contesting Earth’s Future (1994), and Integral 
Ecology (2009).

Reading Bruce Hyde and Drew Kopp’s insightful book, Speaking Being, has been a
remarkable journey, one that brings me back to the transformation I experienced 
when I took The est Training in December 1981. During the Training, I discovered a
t
profound and wholly unanticipated connection between the work of Werner Erhard 
and that of Martin Heidegger. In spring 1982, I would find myself writing a philo-
sophical appraisal of the Training at Erhard’s request. This appraisal and related 
conversations were two of many factors that eventuated in The Forum, which rolled
out in 1985.
Erhard developed the key elements of what would become The Forum (and
later, The Landmark Forum) long before he knew anything about Heidegger. The 
point of Speaking Being is not to show that Erhard’s ideas derive from Heidegger’s,
but rather that there is a remarkable aff inity between ideas that the two thinkers 
arrived at independently. The first question I will explore at length is this: Do the 
remarkable parallels between the work of Erhard and Heidegger confirm the validity
of their respective findings?
Some autobiographical comments will help to contextualize my answer. Al-
though I eventually wrote two books and dozens of scholarly articles about Heide-
gger’s philosophy, my first encounter with it was an abject failure. In spring 1968, 
as a senior philosophy major in college, I took a seminar on Being and Time (1927),
Heidegger’s most important work. I was feeling confident because the previous 
semester I had apparently managed to make a little sense of Alfred North White-
head’s Process and Reality (1927), a notoriously diff icult text. The title of Heidegger’s
y
book attracted me, as did its cover, with large white letters standing against a black 
background. The seminar was over my head, although I was hardly alone in my 
confusion. Little secondary literature in English was available on Being and Time,
which had been translated only a few years earlier. Aft er struggling to about page
180, I realized that I had understood nothing about what was going on—especially 
not how important “nothing” was to prove in Being and Time. 
As a graduate student at Tulane University, I gave Being and Time another try,
this time in a seminar taught by Edward G. Ballard, who later became my disser-
tation director. In that seminar, I began to chip away at Heidegger’s conceptual 
massif. Later, as a Fulbright-Hays Fellow in Belgium in 1972–73, I worked on my PhD
f
dissertation, “The Concept of the Self in Heidegger’s Being and Time.” Ballard was
enamored of Plato’s thinking because it combined philosophical depth with the pos-
sibility of transformation for the one who engages wholeheartedly with the Platonic
dialectic. Such a transformation, so Ballard maintained, is necessary to understand 
what Plato was pointing at.

Gradually, I concluded that the same was true for making sense of Being and 
Time.1 (And later I found undergoing a transformative experience was also required
to truly understand Erhard’s est Training program and later The Forum program.) To
t
understand the book meant doing more than writing intelligible sentences about its 
oft en diff icult and controversial ideas. I needed to undergo the anxiety (Angst
(
) that
discloses human existence as neither a body nor even a mind, but instead as the
temporal clearing or openness in which things can manifest themselves and in that 
sense can “be.” Surrendering to the mood of anxiety, however, is akin to a death
experience, from which we ordinarily flee. Heidegger’s concept of authentic human 
existence, at least so I argued in Eclipse of the Self, amounts to the following.2 One
must own up to the fact that one has been thrown into the world as the mortal, tem-
poral openness required for entities to reveal themselves in various ways. Anxiety 
invites us to suspend momentarily our absorption into the average, everyday way of 
existing (for Erhard, this includes what he would call “running one’s racket”), so that 
otherwise hidden possibilities—specific to our own capacities and situations—can
reveal themselves. Heidegger insisted, however, as does Erhard, that taking a stand 
upon one’s own finite possibilities is not only unusual, but also diff icult to sustain. 
We tend to fall back again and again into the tranquillizing mode of everyday life, in
which there is supposedly nothing really new or important to be discovered.
One day in the early 1970s, while a grad student at Tulane, I had a full-blown
anxiety moment that began as I was walking through the University Center. All 
of a sudden, the people, furniture, floor and ceiling began pulling away from me. 
Everyone and everything became utterly meaningless, insignificant, and pointless.
My projects, self-understanding, goals and objectives—these, too, fell away, leaving
only bare, unmotivated, directionless awareness. The world had become empty and
meaningless. Aft er a while, things started to regain their significance, such that I was 
able to find my way around once again. This experience confirmed for me much of 
what Heidegger had said about anxiety in Being and Time and elsewhere.
The occasion for another important insight occurred in early January 1978 on a
dark and stormy night. At the time, I was suff ering from the flu, which seemed like a
symptom of my unhappy personal situation. Feeling miserable while holed up in my
tiny apartment, I heard a knock at the door. A friend whom I rarely saw stood there, 
shielding himself from the rain. Presenting me with a book, he said:  “Here, Michael.
I think you should read this.” With that, he departed, leaving me with a copy of Baba
Ram Dass’s book, Be Here Now.3 Formerly Richard Alpert, a psychology professor at 
Harvard, Ram Dass (along with colleague Timothy Leary) had been dismissed from
the university for turning students onto LSD. Traveling to India, where he found his 
guru, Ram Dass discovered that various meditative and yogic practices could gener-
ate the non-attachment and non-duality associated with enlightenment—without 
using drugs. Be Here Now was so influential because Ram Dass brilliantly explained
major aspects of Indian teachings in ways that could resonate with Western readers.
Years earlier, I had seen Be Here Now at a bookstore, but I had dismissed it as
w
pop psychology masquerading as Eastern religion. I had little patience for either,
especially Asian thought to which my way was barred by a regrettable ethnocen-
trism. That this very book would appear unbidden in the midst of a personal crisis 
persuaded me to read it that very night. In the wee hours I experienced something 
like kensho, the Zen term for an initial awakening.4 I realized with unprecedented 
conviction that my life was misguided, even though by the standards of most peo-
ple, including academics, my life was successful. Gripped by fear, I had long tried to
protect myself in ways that provoked unnecessary suff ering in myself and in others.
Attempting to satisfy various cravings, I had sometimes acted in ways that did not 
make me feel proud. Suddenly, Søren Kierkegaard’s dictum, “The specific quality 
of despair is not knowing that one is desperate,” struck me like a thunderbolt. That 
night, I resolved to become a Zen monk, thereby supposing that doing so would 
somehow bring me happiness.
First, of course, I needed to learn how to meditate.  Asian traditions oft en speak 
of the tyranny of the “monkey mind,” the relentless interior chatter that jumps from
one topic to the next. My everyday experience was filled by neurotic chatter. All the 
time I was thinking that it was I who was thinking, even though perhaps it would
be better to say that the thoughts were having me!  Aft er many years of meditation
practice, I finally learned how to silence the interior voice upon command. In the
summer of 1979, I spent five weeks as a guest student at Green Gulch Farm (near 
Muir Woods outside of San Francisco) and at Tassajara Zen Mountain Retreat Center,
both of which were run by the San Francisco Zen Center. Arising at 4 am to meditate 
every day (except Sundays, when we could sleep in until 6!) was challenging, in part
by the emotional torment provoked by being apart from my girlfriend, whom I even-
tually married. Clearly, I had a lot of work ahead of me.
In February 1980, I took part in a seven-day sesshin at the London Zen Center.
This was very serious business. Run by a well-known Rinzai Zen monk from Kyoto, 
the sesshin required us to sit cross-legged for 40 minutes, sixteen times per day. Each
day was divided into four sessions of four 40-minute sittings. During the evening of 
the third day, pain in my left  knee had become so overwhelming that I was exhaust-
ed. There was no way out, of course, because if you move your body in a Zen
y
sesshin,
you might as well go home. Having held the pain at arm’s length for as long as

possible, I finally surrendered to it. My expectation was that I would be obliterated, 
leaving a smoking pile of rubble on the zafu (meditation cushion). Amazingly, how-
ever, the pain vanished, and was replaced by very intense sensations that had no 
pain valence, so long as I did not introduce any temporal distinctions, such as “This
has lasted so long. . . ” or “How many more minutes. . . .” Upon introducing such dis-
tinctions, the excruciating pain would return, only to abate when I dove ever more
deeply into it, embracing and experiencing each subtle and not so subtle aspect of 
it.  This was an astonishing discovery, which encouraged me to explore knee pain far 
earlier during a later ten-day meditation retreat in Barre, Massachusetts. By letting
the sensations show up just as they occurred instant-by-instant, without telling a
story about them or representing them in some other way, they showed up as they 
were rather than as how I had been representing them. By going ever more deeply 
into the source of pain, I eventually experienced the disappearance of self and even
space/time, leaving nothing at all, which I later interpreted as what Heidegger called 
the “clearing,” the no-thingness that allows all contents of awareness to reveal
themselves. Those contents can include the multiple stories we make up about 
what shows up, but I discovered the diff erence between the sheer showing up
(Being) of contents, on the one hand, and my representations/stories about them, 
on the other.
During the Zen sesshin, each of us had a nightly meeting with the Zen master,
a remarkable human being. I was typically a basket case when climbing the stairs
to his room, where he sat cross-legged. Usually, he just looked at me for a few 
moments—without saying a word—before ringing the dismissal bell. I hoped that 
the smile on his face was benevolent! Whatever shreds of self-assurance I may have 
had before climbing the steps—“Aft er all, a man is justified in being tired aft er such
rigorous meditation!”—were removed by his penetrating gaze. I had a long way to
go before I could ever be like him. Nevertheless, his extraordinary mode of Being 
showed me what is possible for a human being. I didn’t have to be this neurotic, 
self-absorbed, worried person.
In December 1981, I took the est Training in a suburb of New Orleans. Given 
t
the previous course of my life, which included writing about Heidegger’s concept
of authentic existence, practicing Zen meditation and hatha yoga, reading widely in 
Eastern and Western spiritual traditions, and above all still wallowing in ignorance, 
I was a prime candidate for what the Training had to off er. It allowed for the pos-
sibility of seeing that one’s “personality” is deeply tied up with one’s “racket,” the 
particular way in which one defends one’s identity by making oneself right and/or 
others wrong, or more generally, constantly justifying oneself. To experience being 
free from my racket, I first had to become aware of its structure (that is, the “payoff s”
and the gratification that seems to come from the payoff s of my racket, and on the 
other hand the “cost” of my rackets to the quality of my life), and second I had to
identify with it, to embrace it (make it my own). Paradoxically, this move was a nec-
essary condition for the next step, distinguishing myself from my racket. In doing so, 
a palpable sense of freedom spontaneously arose. What had been my subjectivity, 
my racket, now became a mere object in a wider awareness. 
As the Training progressed, I began to conclude that this wider awareness is an 
instance of what Heidegger had in mind by the “clearing,” the openness that consti-
tutes human existence. For Heidegger, authentic human existing means letting this 
clearing disclose entities as they are, rather than as how they show up through one’s
projections, stories, and self-justifying assertions. At one point, in reply to the Train-
er’s query about what we were beginning to realize, I raised my hand to say: “Who
we really are is no-thing! We are not things, not identities, not personalities, not 
emotions—we are the clearing in which all these can arise.” Even the distinction that 
we are no-thing, so I came to realize, arises within the clearing. As Heidegger would
put it, we don’t own the clearing; instead, the clearing “owns” us so that things can 
show up and thus “be.” I would later discover that while I was in that 1981 est Train-
ing, Werner Erhard was exploring some of the ways in which Heidegger’s thought 
overlapped with and could grant greater force to the ideas embodied in the Training.
Not long ago, when I was conversing with Erhard, he referred to this famous 
phrase from Heidegger’s essay “What Is Metaphysics?” (1929): We are “held out
into the nothing.”5 Erhard maintains that The Forum is designed to allow for this
experience, to be held out into the nothing, that is, into the emptiness and mean-
inglessness of existence. Without first-person experience of this emptiness, people
continue to cling to the subjective narratives that give rise to their rackets, as well as
other automatic instances of inauthenticity. Having become aware of their rackets
and their narrative-based identities, participants can notice the clearing—under-
stood not only as the open space needed for things to show up and thus “to be,” but 
also as the opening for a possible future in which things might be other than what
r
would otherwise be predictable; indeed, a possible future in which people at times
might make choices not dictated by their rackets. The
t
experience of being held out
into the nothing, into meaninglessness, is necessary for disclosing the ontological
event called the clearing.
In our conversation, Erhard aff irmed that his profound encounter with the empti-
ness and meaninglessness of his own identity did not lead—contrary to expectation—
to moral irresponsibility and nihilism. In fact, prior to that encounter, he had acted

irresponsibly in ways that occasioned considerable suff ering on the part of others,
including members of his own family. He reported that by wiping away the signifi-
cance of his story, he was left  only with the ontological clearing. At this moment, what
l
showed up was the mess that he had created, but without any story about it, as well 
as the authentic obligation to clean things up. Erhard told me that in cleaning things 
up with his family, he told them he was not apologizing to them, because that would
somehow soft en the raw fact of what he had done. So long as he was his story, his 
self-justifying interior narrative, the suff ering he had provoked remained blunted. He
could not let others be who they were; instead, they were reduced to pawns in his own 
game. Unthinking identification with his story stood in the way of allowing others to
be beyond the limits imposed by their own narratives. This recognition contributed to 
his decision to initiate the est Training.
t
What it means to share in the est Training 
and The Forum
Most of the activity in the Training involved sharing by participants. Trainers (later, 
Forum leaders) were there to help participants recognize their rackets, their ways
of manipulating self and others for ends that are oft en not understood. As Hyde 
and Kopp have demonstrated so well in their book, the inter-subjective component 
was crucial to the success of The Forum, as it was for the est Training. The centrality
t
of sharing in the Training helps to explain why it could take people so far so fast,
when compared to other avenues to transformation. Over the course of many hours, 
participants listen to each other describe a similar mode of Being-in-the-world: 
operating so as to promote survival oft en at the expense of others and their own 
quality of life. It is easier to recognize these inauthentic ways of being in others, but 
having done so leaves me with the possibility of seeing them in myself. The Training 
and later The Forum (and The Landmark Forum) allowed over two million people 
to reliably experience liberation from their rackets, from the compulsion to be right 
(oft en at the expense of others) and from the need to constantly self-justify. 
In the Training that I took—and as in the 1989 Forum recounted in this book—
the dialogue opened up, and soon revealed that the participants were frustrated,
suff ering, confused, and hiding their pettiness, all because of what the Forum leader 
called their “rackets.” At first most people scoff ed at the idea that they were running
y
(or were run by) a racket. Instead, they were amazed at the ridiculous things that
other apparently accomplished people were saying about conducting their lives. 
Gradually, however, the courage exhibited by certain participants in their honest
sharing shift ed the mood in the room to one of utmost seriousness regarding what
was being disclosed. Increasingly, we began to support one another in the sharing 
process. We came to recognize that, perhaps for the first time, we were speaking 
frankly with others about what really matters in life, and about the obstacles that we
had placed in the path of living aligned with what really matters.
I recall one particular moment when I experienced this for myself. It was on
the Saturday aft ernoon of the second weekend of the Training that I took in 1981,
when participants were asked to take part in a “milling” exercise (which is not found
in The Forum or The Landmark Forum). The ballroom had been cleared of chairs.
In the large open space, we were asked to walk slowly around, making eye contact 
with others, but not engaging in conversation. We were simply to witness each oth-
er. By this point, many of us had already shared our stories. Otherwise successful, 
educated, and capable people had started to “come clean” about their rackets. We 
were in touch with the vast pain, heartache, sorrow, and frustration brought about
by our treachery, lying, cowardice, and perhaps above all self-deception. Even as I
write about this, I am brought back into that extraordinary moment, when waves 
of compassion began arising within me. I had never experienced anything like it. 
Finally understanding the mechanical, unavoidable aspect of so much human be-
havior, I also began to forgive others, and myself. We are thrown into a very diff icult
situation, we self-conscious human beings. Doing our best to survive and prosper, 
we sometimes act in ways that later haunt us.
The courageous sharing that occurred in the Training allowed me and others
to see the truth of the Hindu saying, Tat tvam asi, “That thou art.” The poor devil 
breaking down across the room, the other person who had made such a mess of her 
life even while being so “successful”—now I could see that person is me, just running
a diff erent racket! One by one, people began to realize that we are all in this togeth-
er. Run by fear, we employ survival strategies, oft en developed before we became 
self-conscious. By the time we are adults, we are deeply patterned to act in ways that 
protect us and that justify us, such that everything we do is “in order to” promote 
our self-defending project, whereas we experience little if anything in and for itself. 
People want to act nobly, generously, courageously, and honestly, but doing so is dif-
t
ficult and rare, which is why we admire people on those occasions when they can act
in such ways. Seeing how compulsive the actions of other people are, participants
gain insight into how circumscribed their own lives are as a result of fear and anxiety,
and see that furthermore, no amount of achievement, success, sex, drugs, and rock 
and roll will “fix me.” It is sometimes said that people are above all committed to
“Being right and looking good,” but in the Training invidious distinctions between

self and other melted away, without any sense of boundary violation. There arose a 
higher level of “we-ness” that respected diff erence, but that no longer allowed diff er-
ence to create an insuperable barrier to being together in the world. 
The Forum hammers home the idea that there is no way to escape the racket 
that constitutes one’s basic way of Being-in-the-world, and that people do what
they do because they have little freedom in the matter. However, perhaps the great-
est realization generated in The Forum, as in the Training, is that despite all this,
people are more than their rackets, more than their fear-driven habitual stances and
practices. Rather, we are the clearing for possibility, as Erhard suggests in the tran-
script of the 1989 Forum. What makes the clearing for possibility available is what 
Erhard calls “being authentic about one’s inauthenticity,” where we own up to—take 
responsibility for—the fact that we compulsively “run rackets.” Such resolute em-
brace of my own inauthenticity unexpectedly allows for a taste of freedom, in which 
a new possibility for action can show up. Such action is motivated not “in order to” 
improve my standing, but instead arises solely for the sake of handling what a given 
situation calls for, as an end in itself.
During the 1970s and 1980s, some critics charged the Training with promot-
ing narcissism, as in the “Me Generation,” and encouraging successful selfishness. 
Although the actions of some Training graduates may have encouraged such critical
evaluations, the Training itself revealed step by step that self-absorption—especially
clinging to my “views” about this or that—is the source of suff ering in my life and in 
the lives of others. Insight into our shared openness, the marvelous freedom with
d
which we are mysteriously endowed, generates not selfishness but rather compas-
sion and the question: “How can I help?” One of Erhard’s favorite phrases goes like
this: “If you forget who you really are, then be of service.” Erhard’s oft en-stated goal 
of creating a world that works for everyone stems from a deep realization that life
is not just about me, it’s about everyone. Like many of those who took the Training
and later The Forum, I would not trade the insight it provided for anything in the 
world. No amount of money, fame, power, sex, drugs, or knowledge is comparable
to what one spiritual tradition calls the “the pearl of great price.”
Spirituality and its relationship to the 
est Training and The Forum
Those who are interested in spirituality and philosophy of religion, as I am, 
can find parallels between Zen Buddhism, Hinduism, and Christianity, on the
one hand, and the Training, on the other. The Training and The Forum are best 
understood, however, as ontological rather than “spiritual” explorations. Unlike
traditional spirituality, as typically experienced in church, synagogue, or mosque, 
and in other non-religious spiritual disciplines, the Training sought to disclose the 
ontological structure of human existence.
Erhard would agree that theologians can draw upon this ontological insight, as 
twentieth-century German theologian Rudolf Bultmann drew upon Heidegger’s phi-
losophy so as to “demythologize” Christian theology. Theology, however, interprets
the transformational experience in accordance with religious concepts and narra-
tives, some of which conflict with the Training’s claim that everything is inherently 
“empty and meaningless,” until we assign a meaning to something that occurs.6 For 
Biblical theism, the universe was meaningful long before humans showed up, be-
cause God intentionally created it. Although informed by an evidence-based idea of 
human existence, the Trainers engaged in phenomenology, that is, instead of getting 
bogged down in discussion of the merits of this theory versus another one, Trainers 
focused on what actually discloses itself in the processes of sharing and interpret-
ing that sharing. As the transcript of the 1989 Forum reveals, the number of shares 
supporting The Forum’s basic assumptions—that we are the clearing in which things
can show up and thus “be,” and that we assign meanings to events that do not 
inherently contain such meaning—was overwhelming.7
In the 1989 Forum, Erhard engages briefly in God-talk, but primarily to dissuade
people from using the idea of God to further their rackets. Doing so, he says at one
point, amounts to blasphemy. “Blasphemy” may seem to be a curious term to use in 
a secular, ontological inquiry. Here is one way to make sense of that usage. The God-
talk in the 1989 Forum is an instance of what Buddhists calls skillful means (upaya). 
Mahayana Buddhism, especially Zen, maintains that “salvation” does not lie in some
far-off  realm still to come, but instead is always already available here and now, in
this very human body/mind. Depicting God as some sort of super entity controlling 
everything from up in heaven, while apart from human existence, impedes discovery
of humankind’s own mode of Being and the possibilities belonging to it. This is the
point made by the shocking Mahayana Buddhist directive: “If you encounter the Bud-
dha on the road, kill him!” You can’t kill the Buddha, however, because he’s not “out 
there.” Instead, Buddha-nature lies within each human being, awaiting the possibility 
of awakening to itself.8 Toward the end of The Forum, there typically arises what I
call “the space of transformation,” that extraordinary moment when most partici-
pants had the experience of shedding the burden of their rackets. Yes, the rackets will
return, but for many people, never with the force that the rackets once had.
Critics sometimes charge that Erhard’s seminars lack “spirituality,” but most 
participants in the 1989 Forum experienced with joy the realization that they are not

substances with certain properties, but instead the clearing that is open to possibil-
ity. What The Forum refuses to provide, and in fact cannot provide based on its own 
method of exploration, is some story about the ultimate “meaning of life.” The three
y
Western monotheisms provide such stories, which have inspired faith for many cen-
turies. Instead of off ering such a story, however, The Forum leaves to participants 
the task of establishing goals and organizing their lives to achieve them. The issue of 
an otherworldly, metaphysical eschaton does not come up, except when it is brought 
up by participants, and then The Forum leader typically brings the conversation 
back to the here and now, to what’s right in front of the participant. And yet, accord-
ing to Erhard, most clergy, be they priest, nun, rabbi, minister, or imam, have left  the
est Training or The Forum with a deeper relation to their particular practice of faith.
t
Deflecting and dismissing “metaphysical” concerns is a common practice
among Zen masters. Having been knocked off  a bridge into the water below by a
Zen master exasperated by his student’s persistent metaphysical questioning, for 
example, one Zen student finally “awakened.” The key was finally realizing the futil-
ity of such questioning and the opportunity of existing fully in this life, moment by
moment. Another anecdote reveals the inveterate tendency to “go metaphysical,”
as well as the opportunity to follow a diff erent path. A famous Zen koan says: “Show 
me your original face before you were born!” I used to think that the answer to this
koan had something to do with revealing who I was in the bardo, the realm in which
one’s “habit-energy” dwells before manifesting itself in a new body-mind.  This is 
“going metaphysical” in a way suggested by some Buddhist discourse. Only recently
did I arrive at a very diff erent interpretation of the koan, one consistent with what I
learned in the Training and later in The Forum. The key is what word to stress in the 
koan: “Show me your original face before YOU were born!” By “you,” the koan has
in mind the fear-driven, greedy, delusional being that I had turned myself into. I did 
not show up in the world like that, but gave birth to that unhappy self by decisions I 
made while growing up. Not long ago, when I asked Werner Erhard if he agreed with
this interpretation of the koan, he said “Yes! That’s it!”
Erhard, Heidegger, and The Forum
Around the time I took the Training, I had been reading psychiatrist Irvin D. Yalom’s
Existential Therapy, which argued that much human suff ering arose from not allow-
ing anxiety and ontological guilt to play the revelatory and transformative role they
could play in human existence.9 Citing authors such as Ernst Becker, author of The 
Denial of Death, Yalom remarked that we shrink from life, we hide ourselves away, in 
order to avoid paying the debt: death.10 Finitude is essential to authentic existence.
Staying in touch with mortality encourages us to be present each moment, rather 
than fleeing into the myriad distractions now available. 
I wrote to Yalom to see if I could study with him during a six-month sabbatical, 
which I planned to spend in the Bay Area in the first half of 1982. He suggested that I
would benefit more by studying and teaching at the California School of Profession-
al Psychology in Berkeley. (The work I did there led to my subsequent appointment 
as a clinical professor in the Psychiatry Department at Tulane University School of 
Medicine.) Shortly aft er arriving in Berkeley in early January, Hubert Dreyfus invited 
me to his house for dinner. Dreyfus was a leading interpreter of Heidegger’s philos-
ophy and later was professor emeritus for many years at the University of California
at Berkeley. Soon, I discovered that he, too, had done the Training, that he had been 
blown away by it, that he knew Werner Erhard, and that he was co-director of the 
PhD dissertation of Fernando Flores, who combined elements of speech act theory, 
which he learned from Berkeley philosopher John Searle, with Heidegger’s view of 
temporal-historical human existence, to develop a powerful vision of “conversation
for action” in the “off ice of the future.” Erhard, a brilliant man in his own right, quick-
ly came to appreciate the role played by language in creating futures where none 
seemed possible. This is a story for another time, however.11
Even before meeting Flores and learning something about Heidegger’s thought,
Erhard and colleagues had been planning to redesign the Training. Erhard invited 
Dreyfus and me to develop philosophical critiques of the Training. We gladly con-
sented to do so, because both of us had gained so much from it. Each of us sat in on
Trainings given at diff erent times and locations, then composed our assessments
of what we witnessed.12 In May 1982 I met with Erhard, Flores, and several of their 
colleagues to discuss my findings. The papers that Dreyfus and I wrote contributed 
to what would become The Forum, the first version of which was presented in San 
Francisco in 1985. It was a pleasure to attend that signal event. I am proud and hap-
py to have made a contribution to the emergence of The Forum.
Not long ago, I re-read the 104-page transcript of the discussion about my 
critique of the Training. Doing so confirmed for me that Erhard had already come
up with the key elements of the Training, later The Forum, independently of what
y
he learned about Heidegger from Flores, Dreyfus, me, and others. Heidegger’s ideas 
were remarkably similar to Erhard’s in many ways, and Erhard learned some valu-
able distinctions from Heidegger, but they arrived at their major ideas on their own.
Heidegger’s writings have had an enormous influence on twentieth-century
philosophy in Europe, Latin America, and to a lesser extent in the United States. 
Perhaps his university teaching helped to evoke transformation experiences on the

part of some students, but he created no seminars with that aim in mind. Erhard’s
work, in contrast, has been made available to more than two million people by way
of the Training and later The Forum. Linguistic distinctions developed by Erhard and
colleagues have had a vast if underappreciated influence on culture in the past forty
years. Many distinctions that Erhard coined or used in new contexts have found their 
way into the larger culture without being attributed to Erhard. The present book is in 
part an eff ort to correct this situation.
Another diff erence between Erhard and Heidegger concerns compassion and 
forgiveness. Those familiar with Heidegger know that such ideas rarely appear in his
early writings. In fact, his writings in the 1930s oft en emphasize steely resolution, 
authentic being-towards-death, and a kind of ruthless commitment to revolutionary 
change. Such discourse became particularly frequent and charged in the years when 
Heidegger was involved with National Socialism, beginning in 1932. Later on, Heide-
gger developed his famous discourse on Gelassenheit, or “releasement,” the attitude
of letting things be, which some have read as including compassion for others. 
Let me now answer the question that I posed at the beginning of this first 
section of this Aft erword, namely, “Do the remarkable parallels between the work 
of Erhard and Heidegger confirm the validity of their respective findings?” The fact
that Heidegger and Erhard arrived independently at similar findings about human
existence justifies taking the two views more seriously than either one alone. The 
remarkable confluence of their findings does not, of course, mean that they are 
true, such that other possible approaches to understanding human existence are 
excluded. Indeed, there are many alternatives, which are oft en incompatible with
one another. As any student of Heidegger’s work knows, it exhibits unusual depth
and originality; likewise, the distinctions that Erhard deployed in the Training and
The Forum have elicited from many thousands of people an experience of the
clearing that is central to Heidegger’s thinking. I hope that the book that Hyde and
Kopp have written will be the first of many other investigations into the ontology of 
human existence and into how we can elicit experiential insight into that ontology.
The question concerning Heidegger’s 
Politics
Let me now pose a second and final question: Do revelations about Heidegger’s
d
far-right-wing political views negate the value of all his work and disqualify him as a
philosopher?
Martin Heidegger settled on a philosophical career only aft er health concerns
required him to end his Jesuit novitiate. He remained drawn to the mysticism of 
Meister Eckhart, avidly read the works of Luther, and was influenced by Gnosticism.
In Being and Time Heidegger drew on such sources, and many others, in describing 
humankind as “thrown” and “fallen,” fleeing from finite openness and from the 
concrete possibilities disclosed therein, embracing instead routinized everyday 
practices, and being seduced by countless distractions aimed at concealing who we
really are. This book revolutionized twentieth-century European philosophy, and
Heidegger had a dramatic eff ect on students, many of whom were Jews, such as 
Hannah Arendt, Herbert Marcuse, Helena Weiss, Hans Jonas, and Karl Löwith.
These students were understandably shocked when in 1933 Heidegger publicly
announced his allegiance to National Socialism. Caught up in the ecstatic revo-
lutionary moment, Heidegger used his own discourse of resolute authenticity to 
encourage others to join him in supporting Adolph Hitler. For a few years Heidegger 
was a devoted follower, but gradually became disenchanted with what one might 
call the “really existing” Nazi party, which he came to regard as another version 
of the same techno-industrial nihilism that in his perspective animated American 
capitalism and Soviet Marxism. Nevertheless, he remained attached to the idea 
that National Socialism had contained an “inner truth and greatness” that had
been perverted by leaders who were not up to the task. Showing little sympathy for 
Heidegger’s attempted self-justification, however, the Allies in charge of post-war 
de-Nazification hearings concluded that his complicity with the Nazi regime made
him unfit for teaching. He was removed from his post at the University of Freiburg. 
Ever since then, controversy has raged about the extent to which the positive con-
tributions of Heidegger’s thought can be separated from his far-right-wing, arguably
anti-Semitic views.
I had always been concerned about his Nazi aff iliation, so much so that my first 
published article bears the title “Heidegger, Ethics, and National Socialism.”13 At that 
time, I tended to side with his supporters, who contended that one should distin-
guish between Heidegger the thinker and Heidegger the man, that is, the misguided 
political activist. Critics, on the other hand, charged that his philosophy had much 
in common with Nazi ideology. In the late 1980s publication of books demonstrating 
the aff inity between important aspects of Heidegger’s thought and Nazi ideology led 
me to rethink my attitude toward his philosophy, as I reported in my book, Heideg-
ger’s Confrontation with Modernity: Technology, Politics, Art. 14
In that book, I argued that Heidegger’s notion of the “history of being” had
much in common with views promoted by various Nazi ideologues and pro-Nazi phi-
losophers. According to Heidegger, modernity is the final stage in the long decline of

Aft erword 539
Western civilization from its grand beginning in ancient Greece. Techno-industrial 
modernity brings to a culmination the nihilistic history of the West. It is worth
noting, as Berkeley philosopher Hans Sluga has pointed out, that Heidegger was 
only one of many German philosophers who became either outright Nazis or else
fellow travellers.15 Many academic humanists of the era—German, French, English,
Spanish, Italian—agreed with Heidegger that modernity was a colossal misstep, 
which promoted the revolt of the masses. Of course, Heidegger’s already elevated 
philosophical status meant that his conversion had greater significance at a time 
when the Nazi regime still sought cultural legitimation. It is also worth noting that
much of what he says about techno-industrial modernity, namely, that it reduces
nature to mere raw material and humankind to resources demanded by the pow-
er-seeking system, is remarkably similar to what was said around the same time by
leading members of the left -wing Frankfurt School, including Theodor Adorno and
Max Horkheimer.
Heidegger’s view of Western history as leading to nihilism stands in stark 
contrast to progressive interpretations, initiated by French Enlightenment thinkers,
as well as by G.W.F. Hegel, Marx, and many other nineteenth- and twentieth-century 
European and American political theorists, according to which history leads to 
emancipation from ignorance and unjust political authority, and to scientific knowl-
edge that promises relief from human misery. Heidegger’s anti-modernist attitudes 
were similar in some ways to those held by Nietzsche. Both thinkers became major 
influences on post-modern theory, which depicts modernity in ways that at times
have much in common with anti-modernist views that prevailed in Germany in the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
Despite his rejection of modernity and his embrace of the far-right Nazi par-
ty, Heidegger carefully avoided anti-Semitic statements in his published works.  
Subsequent historical research has showed, however, that while he was Rektor of 
the University of Freiburg (1933–34), he made such statements in off icial letters and 
engaged in some anti-Jewish activity. 
The ongoing publication of the Black Notebooks, which Heidegger began to 
compose in the 1930s, brings the political controversy to a new stage. In these Note-
books, now appearing in his Gesamtausgabe (Collected Works), Heidegger writes that 
European Jewry played a significant role in the rise of “calculative” thinking, which
he held responsible for modernity’s disclosure of everything as mere means for en-
hancing power. At times, he suggested that the Jews were somehow responsible for 
the rise of such thinking, but at other times he indicated that the Jews were pawns 
in the process by which the Being of entities had concealed itself, with the result that
entities (including humans) had been gradually reduced to sheer 
instrumentality.
For Heidegger, human existence opens up the clearing in which entities can
manifest themselves and in this sense “be.” Supposedly, the ancient Greeks were
opened up in a way that allowed entities to stand forth, to reveal themselves in 
ways that gave rise to incomparable beauty and terrible violence. Gradually, how-
ever, the clearing that constitutes human existence began to become constricted,
beginning already with Plato and Aristotle (!). Hence, the Being of entities could re-
veal itself in ever more limited ways. Instead of existing so as to let entities be man-
ifest in their own ways, humankind asserted itself as the human subject, arrogating 
to itself the right to dominate the planet. Such violent self-assertion, according to 
Heidegger, results not from a merely human decision, but instead from eff acement 
of the Being of entities. In addition to blaming the Jews for this outcome, he also
assigns responsibility for it to the Catholic Church, American capitalism, Soviet 
Marxism, scientism, democracy, and other institutions. In some ways, Heidegger 
was an equal-opportunity denouncer. 
Heidegger goes so far as to suggest that the death camps, however terrible their 
outcome was for Jews, were the products of the very same calculative, instrumen-
tal, power-driven thinking that they had promulgated. Today, we would call this 
“blaming the victims.” That he held such a view helps to explain, at last, his silence
about the Holocaust. We may be charitable in saying that he did not endorse the 
death camps, but he did not speak out against them, even aft er the war, much to the 
consternation of his Jewish students as well as many other philosophers who had 
learned from Heidegger’s publications.
Anti-Semitism was widespread in Europe and America in the decades leading 
up to World War II. It became particularly ferocious in Germany for many diff erent
reasons, one of them being that emancipated Jews turned out to be exceptionally 
intelligent, capable, and hard-working, thereby winning positions of influence in
academia, medicine, law, and business. These achievements, presumably unexpect-
ed by a German population still harboring anti-Semitic views, provoked widespread 
ressentiment, as Nietzsche put it. Germany’s defeat in World War I, accusations of 
internal betrayal that led to that outcome, the punitive treaty at Versailles, the Great
Inflation followed by Great Depression, widespread street fighting between Nazi
Brownshirts and communists, and the perceived political gridlock arising from the 
democratic Weimar regime, helped to create the conditions that allowed for a char-
ismatic demagogue like Hitler to seize power by blaming Jews for Germany’s misery. 
Describing these social, political, and economic conditions, however, does not

remove personal responsibility for Heidegger and others who chose to side with the
Nazis and who tolerated the violence they wreaked on millions of innocent people. 
There has already been a virtual tidal wave of commentary addressing the
question  of Heidegger’s anti-Semitism,  most recently as it appears in his Black 
Notebooks.16  Some scholars conclude that Heidegger’s should no longer be 
taught or studied, because it is allegedly “contaminated” with far-right-wing and
anti-Semitic views. My own view is that Heidegger’s philosophical gift s were so great 
that we would make a mistake to boot him out of the philosophical cannon, any 
more than we should exclude Wagner from the musical canon, even though his 
anti-Semitic attitudes may be discerned on occasion in some of his greatest operas, 
not to mention in his published essays. In both cases, we must read and listen with
discernment, with recognition that even brilliant philosophical work and stirring 
musical compositions may contain dark and dangerous aspects. 
Publication of the Black Notebooks ought to be an occasion for reflection about 
the anti-Semitic and racist views that characterized much of the Western world, es-
pecially in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Recent work on American slavery
has demonstrated that this dreadful industrial regime provided the wealth needed 
for capitalism to get up a head of steam by the middle of the nineteenth century.17
American and European colonialism, justified by white supremacist notions of “the
white man’s burdens,” included practices that we should look back upon with hor-
ror. Heidegger belonged to a version of that white supremacist world, even though
he adhered not to biological racism, but instead to a kind of metaphysical-linguistic
racism focused on the exceptionalism of the ancient Greeks and the German Volk. 
Racist views, to be sure, were held by many, including those whom we otherwise 
revere. The recent controversy over public display of the Confederate flag in some 
Southern states demonstrates the cultural staying power of anti-modernism, includ-
ing white supremacy.
Heidegger should continue to be studied and appreciated for his important 
philosophical contributions, especially work from the era of Being and Time, which
proves most important for understanding the parallels between Erhard’s work and
Heidegger’s. His later writings, including his powerful reflections on the nature of 
language, and his eff ort to understand the essence of modern technology, also merit
attention, though they should be read while keeping in mind that they sometimes
entwined themselves with his far-right-wing political views. 
One of the things that struck some of Heidegger’s students when reading Being
and Time was this: What should be the content of decisions made within the light of 
t
resolute authenticity?  I am resolved, but resolved to do what? Heidegger answered
that question for himself in the early 1930s by becoming a Nazi. According to him,
only the situation itself makes clear what is called for. For him, then, authenticity 
was consistent with being a Nazi, which for Heidegger also meant taking a stand 
against Soviet Marxism, which he regarded as a mortal threat to Western civilization.
The inconceivable atrocities of the Holocaust seem to annul the validity of Heideg-
ger’s decision to support Nazism, even if his concern about Soviet Marxism may have 
been justified. Throughout history, people have committed violence when they felt 
duty-bound to fulfill some great task. There is no guarantee that anything we choose 
to do now, even in moments of apparent clarity, will later prove morally praisewor-
thy.18 Heidegger joined a movement that provoked World War II and killed millions of 
people in concentration camps. Presumably, readers of this book would agree that 
at some point before he died, or even posthumously, Heidegger should have off ered
some expression of regret for his contributions to the Nazi movement. We can only
speculate about why he refused to do so, but one reason may be his inability to tell
the truth about his personal responsibility. Heidegger was a particular moral agent,
not the spokesperson for the “history of Being.” 
Although Erhard’s Forum is apolitical, it is not morally neutral. Those who took
The Forum in the late 1980s, or The Landmark Forum up until the present, will recall
its emphasis on making a diff erence by contributing to the community. When Erhard
initiated the Hunger Project in the 1970s, his goal was to demonstrate that we could
end the conversation that holds hunger to be inevitable. Instead, we can initiate a
new conversation, according to which hunger can be ended. Despite being criticized
in some circles, the Hunger Project was an important social, economic, and political
intervention. It invited people to commit to this proposition: We do not have to put 
up with hunger. There is enough food, but we lack the conviction that hunger can 
be eliminated. By changing our attitude toward hunger, we can end it, thus helping 
to create a world that works for everyone. Or as Erhard would put it, by altering the 
way hunger occurs for us as inevitable, so that it can occur for us as
r
endable, our 
behavior related to hunger would also be altered.
Erhard would agree that life is dangerous. In taking a stand, we may end up 
going astray, even though it made sense to take that stand at the moment. One 
of the reasons that The Forum’s sharing is so important, however, is its revelation 
that most people really want to make a diff erence that contributes to human well
being and—these days—to planetary well being, too. Creating and attempting to 
bring to fruition possible and desirable futures—these are risky endeavors. Not only
can they fail, and usually will fail, but at times they will cause more harm than they 
attempted to prevent. Recognizing this is an invitation to heed what others have to

say, especially those who are most critical about what we propose to do. Heedless
confidence in your own way of being the one that will perfect the world, as was the
case in totalitarian movements of the twentieth century, is almost certainly a recipe
for disaster. New worlds must be built together with people from a wide variety of 
perspectives, pre-modern, modern, and post-modern.
*********
In the foregoing book, Hyde and Kopp have threaded the needle. They have showed 
that Heidegger’s work has important parallels with ideas that Erhard arrived at on 
his own, and they have done so in a way that leaves no room for ascribing either 
far-right-wing or far-left -wing views to Erhard. Although he may be an existentialist, 
he is also a modernist, unlike Heidegger.  I regard Speaking Being as an enormous-
ly important contribution to understanding Heidegger and Erhard. The latter has 
received far too little serious academic attention, and this book begins to make up 
for that lack. Moreover, the book’s analysis of Heidegger’s thought is among the best 
that I have ever read. I commend this book to all readers without reservation.

11  Through Dreyfus’s good off ices, I met both Erhard and Flores, as a result of which the 
six months I spent in Berkeley proved to be extraordinary. Flores introduced Erhard to
Heidegger’s work, as well as to my book, Eclipse of the Self. In introducing me to a talk I was
f
to give to some Trainers, Erhard said that he had read more of my book than any book since
Shogun. Erhard has oft en acknowledged his debt to the Zen tradition. Heidegger was new
to him, but not to the Japanese, who have produced at least five translations of Heidegger’s 
Being and Time, because they sense a connection between sunyata and what Heidegger had in 
mind by nothingness (das Nichts) or the clearing that constitutes human existence.

 A distinction is made sometimes between kensho and satori. Kensho is a first taste of 
enlightenment, but one that must be continually cultivated and repeated. One transformation
experience is enough to get one started on the journey, but Buddhism argues that many
lifetimes are required to overcome the conditioning imposed by the three poisons, greed,
aversion and delusion.

 Conversation with Werner Erhard, November 24, 2015.
6 
 In Heidegger and Theology (London and New York: 2014), Judith Wolfe shows that even
though Heidegger’s philosophy arose in constant critical dialogue with theology, Being and 
Time analyzes finite human existence, without reference to God. Heidegger’s contention 
that authentic existence involves Being-towards-death suggests an “eschatology without
eschaton.” In “The Facticity of Being God-Forsaken: The Young Heidegger and Luther’s
Theology of the Cross,” American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly, 79, 2 (2005), 273–290,
y
Sean J. McGrath argues that the task of phenomenology is to describe the Being of the fallen 
human, and also to depict the extent to which finite, fallen existence can be authentic.
Theology’s eschatological concern with salvation and a possibly eternal aft erlife are not 
matters of concern to philosophy, Heidegger concluded.
7 
 Humans are very good at recognizing patterns and making distinctions, but for patterns to
be experienced as meaningful, they must somehow matter to our Being-in-the-world. Our 
r
existence is always at stake for us, which is what Heidegger meant by saying that the very 
Being of humankind is care. Arguably, until computers exist in a clearing of their own, their 
distinction-making—no matter how much faster than human distinction-making—will have 
no significance for computers themselves. Computers are (not yet) at issue for themselves. 
See Michael E. Zimmerman, “Heidegger on Techno-Posthumanism: Revolt against Finitude? 
Or, Doing What Comes ‘Naturally’?” in Perfecting Human Futures: Technology, Secularization
and Eschatology, ed. J. Benjamin Hurlbut and Hava Tirosh-Samuelson (Dordrecht: Springer,
y
2015). In his books and many articles, Hubert Dreyfus has pioneered a Heideggerian critique of 
Artificial Intelligence.

 Something similar is true for certain interpretations of Christianity. When Jesus called his 
followers “sons and daughters of God,” he aff irmed they were always already divine, although
y
cloaked in sin (analogous in some ways to rackets). As German philosopher G.W.F. Hegel put 
it two centuries ago, in a controversial interpretation, Jesus was the first person to awaken to 
his own divinity.
