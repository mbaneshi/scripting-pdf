SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
You have no idea: she struggles with being on time.
MARY
Yeah.
ERHARD
So now it’s okay with him.
(laughter)
JAKE
I believe that people’s intentions are important. Let’s take a poll.
ERHARD
If we took a poll 100 years ago, somebody in here would be burned as a witch.
JAKE
That’s true.
Another participant, Paul, spoke up while remaining seated.
PAUL
In some languages making promises sometimes involves using a special tense that says you
might not arrive.
ERHARD  (laughing)
When I arrive, if I do...
PAUL
It’s characteristic of other languages. In Spanish there’s all these subjunctive tenses. You can
say: “When you do this for me, then I’ll do that.” It’s subjunctive, it’s something we don’t recog-
nize in our language. It’s recognized as theoretical. Maybe that’s what you’re getting at.
ERHARD
No it’s not, but what you’ve said is useful nevertheless for what I am getting at: that you will
present yourself as a person who will do what you said you will do, and you don’t do what you
say you will do. In fact maybe you will do it and maybe you won’t. That’s inauthentic.
PAUL
Well, I wouldn’t agree.
Forum Day One: Session Two
49
ERHARD
Why don’t you stand up for a while?
PAUL  (standing and receiving a microphone)
To me being inauthentic is to say you’re going to do something without fully intending to do it.
That’s inauthentic to me.
ERHARD
Try to keep in mind I’ve been discussing this for seventeen years with people almost as smart as
you are. And I’m still saying this thing. I haven’t met the person, although I haven’t met anyone
as smart as you...
PAUL
Nor have I met anybody as smart as you.
ERHARD
You don’t know that.
PAUL
I know I don’t, but neither do you know what you are saying.
ERHARD
Oh, you’re going to do your program with me, right?
PAUL
Oh no, I’m just...
ERHARD
Wait, wait. I don’t know a word for that except “asshole.”
(laughter)
If someone pays $625 to come in and take my course and they take the time to do their course
with me for free, that’s an asshole.
PAUL
You’re playing with words.
ERHARD
What isn’t playing with words?
PAUL
Well anything nonverbal is obviously not playing with words.
50
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Really? Are you a linguist?
PAUL
Yeah, I speak three languages.
ERHARD
I didn’t ask if you speak three languages, I asked if you understood language. Is that your busi-
ness? Is language your business?
PAUL
No, but I speak several languages.
ERHARD
How many people in this room speak several languages?
(many hands raised)
I have a lot of respect for people who speak several languages. I don’t mean any disrespect, but
it doesn’t mean you know shit about language.
PAUL
Well, language encompasses a pattern of thought, a process of thought. It’s contained within
the language you think within. Like I was referring to with Spanish, you have within the lan-
guage incorporated a structure for dealing with the fact that some things are hypothetical, some
things are real...
ERHARD  (to the group)
You want to listen to this very carefully, because otherwise you’re going to stand up and do this.
And I’m going to let him do this long enough that you can see what it looks like. Go on Paul.
PAUL
The point is, I agree, that to be inauthentic is to, you’re saying that it is to, to do something, to
say you’re going to do something and, nobody knows, I could say I’m going to walk over here,
and the world may end before I get there.
ERHARD
That’s not my point. That’s not what I said.
PAUL
Well, what is the point?
Forum Day One: Session Two
51
ERHARD
The point is, to present your self in one way and be another way is inauthentic.
PAUL
Yeah, that’s true.
ERHARD
That’s what I said from the beginning. It’s like I said one and one is two, and then you say,
“Well, not always...”
PAUL
But that doesn’t account for intention. There are some things within one person’s realm of con-
trol and other things that aren’t.
ERHARD
You’re nutty about this too.
(pointing to Jake)
I want you to listen here. We’ll get this now. I don’t know if he’ll get it, but you’ll get it.
PAUL
I’m trying to clarify the distinction.
ERHARD
Hold on. I understand. See, look: I didn’t say anything about intention. You brought that up,
actually it was Jake, but in this conversation, you brought that up.
PAUL
Yes.
ERHARD
I said that “inauthentic” was to present yourself in one way, and be another way. That’s pretty
goddamn simple, isn’t it?
PAUL
Sure, yeah.
ERHARD
And is that inauthentic?
52
SPEAKING BEING
PAUL
Yes, if that is your way of being.
ERHARD
That is what I said. I said if you present yourself in one way, and you’re actually being another
way, that’s inauthentic. Right?
PAUL
Sure, if you’re mindful of the fact that you’re that other way.
ERHARD
Well how about if the moon comes up blue with pink polka dots?
PAUL
Well...
ERHARD
How about if the world ends in 30 seconds? My question is: Why are you coming up with these
little things about intentionality, when what I’m saying is very simple?
PAUL
Well, because it implies will.
ERHARD
It doesn’t imply anything. If you present yourself one way, when in fact you are another way,
that’s inauthentic. If it says gold stamped on a thing and it’s not gold, that’s inauthentic.
PAUL
No.
ERHARD
It’s when you present yourself one way, and you’re another way—that’s inauthentic.
PAUL
Well, I don’t agree, but still. I think that’s the wrong word.
ERHARD (to Jake)e
Do you get that he doesn’t agree with that?
JAKE
Can I respond to what you’re saying?
Forum Day One: Session Two
53
ERHARD
Did you get that he doesn’t agree with that?
JAKE
We’re not exactly aligned.
ERHARD
I understand that. Jake, you’re not exactly aligned from exactly the same place.
(addressing the two men)
You’re both nutty about your word. He’s coming from the same thing. If you thought it was gold
t
and you stamped gold on it, then it’s really gold. You hear how stupid that sounds?
JAKE
Yeah.
ERHARD
That’s what you said.
JAKE
I didn’t say that.
ERHARD (indicating Paul)
That’s what he said. Pretty stupid what he said, isn’t it? If you thought it was gold and you
t
stamped gold on it, then it’s really gold. That’s what really counts, what you intended. Right?
JAKE
It doesn’t make it authentic, but it doesn’t make me dishonest. It doesn’t make me a liar either.
ERHARD  (to the group)
I’m taking all this time with this bullshit because I want to accomplish something. No mat-
ter what I bring up, somebody will have a thing about it. Somebody will be nutty about it. No
matter what they’re saying, it’s obvious these two guys are intelligent. But they’ve got their foot
nailed to the fl oor, so it’s like talking to stupid people. Being stuck makes you stupid. There’s no
power available where you’ve got your foot nailed to the fl oor. All this conversation regarding
intention, in response to my simple statement about authenticity, indicates that there’s some
nuttiness there. The point is, at some point, you will be that person.
(to Jake)
And to settle this conversation: I ask you to stand in—that a person who presents himself one
way, and in fact acts another way, for any reason, is inauthentic. That’s not true. It’s a “take the
case that” I’m asking you to stand in. Is that clear?
“
There’s no power available where you’ve got
your foot nailed to the floor.
54
SPEAKING BEING
Jake nodded and then sat down.
ERHARD (to Paul)
Did you get what I said to him?
PAUL
Yeah, so, what you’re saying is that specifi c instance you didn’t do what you said, you’re inau-
thentic, and I would agree with you there, but...
ERHARD
I don’t want your agreement. I want you to create this square.
(drawing an imaginary square on the fl oor in front of Paul)
Inside that square is a diff erent world. Inside that world, when you act one way and present
yourself another way, that’s inauthentic.
PAUL
Specifi cally, or generally?
ERHARD
Generally. Just in that world. It’s not true in the rest of the world. Can you handle that?
PAUL
Yeah. I’m not sure what it applies to, but...
ERHARD
It doesn’t apply to anything. Can you handle that?
PAUL
Yeah.
ERHARD
Stand in that square and listen to what I say next. Because only standing there will what I’m
about to say make any sense. All right? You ready to stand in that square?
(to Paul)
You ready? So in that little square, I know it’s not true, and it’s not that way in the rest of the
world, and for those for whom one and one is two, when you pretend to be one way and act
another, that’s called inauthentic. When you own up to this, that’s being authentic about your
inauthenticity. Anybody not get that? That’s the beginning of authenticity. Authenticity does not
AUTHENTICITY
Here Erhard provides a counterintuitive, but very Heideggerian
premise: authenticity is possible only with the development
of an authentic relationship with our own inauthenticity. Here
authenticity is an act of ownership, of owning the calculative
clearing which we are, of accepting the particular gift  of Being
whose sending characterizes our epoch. Heidegger introduced
this idea in Being and Time, where he employed the term
“resoluteness” to characterize Dasein’s state of having-
appropriated; he described this resoluteness as an empowering
authenticity toward one’s own inauthenticity:
Resoluteness appropriates untruth authen-
tically. Dasein is already in irresoluteness,
and soon, perhaps, will be in it again. . . . The
irresoluteness of the “they” remains domi-
nant, notwithstanding, but it cannot impugn
resolute existence. (BT 345)
“
This idea lies at the heart of the appropriative event: in
the context of having appropriated one’s inauthenticity, that
inauthenticity, which persists, is nevertheless transformed.
It is an idea which defies our usual thinking: ontically, such a
“transformation” can only be seen as blatant self-justification, a
philosophically sophisticated rationalization for accepting one’s
worst nature. Ontologically, however, appropriation justifies
nothing. Appropriation appropriates; it gives Being. Resoluteness,
then, is “the opening up of human being, out of its captivity in
that which is, to the openness of Being” (“OWA” in PLT 67). Much
of The Forum is devoted to developing the possibility of a non-
justificatory event of appropriation. ■
Forum Day One: Session Two
55
begin with being authentic. Authenticity begins with being authentic about your inauthenticity.
If you’re ever going to have any degree of authenticity the only way to get there is to start with
being authentic about your inauthenticity.
(to the group)
I’m not interested in your belief systems, I’m not interested in your values, I’m not interested in
your principles. So no more conversations like I just had with Jake and Paul. I don’t mean don’t
say anything, I mean don’t preach. I’ll do all the preaching in here, and if I’m any good, I won’t
do any either. All I’m asking when I talk to you about the things I’m talking about is: build
a square, stand inside of it, look out at life and the world and see what you can see standing
in that square and standing in that possibility. If it empowers you to stand there, keep it. If it
doesn’t empower you to stand there, destroy it. Simple.
BELLA
You said to someone else that something happened when they were a child. I remembered. My
father was a liar, and I decided I could never be that. I had to be honest. I’ve had no freedom to
keep my word.
ERHARD
You can’t be anything you’re forced to be. Anything you are forced to be, you aren’t.
BELLA
I couldn’t stand the feeling.
ERHARD
Yeah.
(to the group)
Who couldn’t stand being a liar?
(several raise their hands)
You think a truth teller would fi nd lying absolutely abhorrent? For the person who tells the
truth you don’t have any problem with a lie, it’s only somebody down in the swamp, in the bot-
tom of the Valley of the Shadow of Death, who is afraid they might be a liar. I know you know
better.
BELLA
I am a liar.
ERHARD
Yeah. You are a liar. That’s being authentic about being inauthentic. And that’s the beginning of
authenticity—and the beginning of the freedom to tell the truth.
“
All I’m asking when I talk to you about the
things I’m talking about is: build a square,
stand inside of it, look out at life and the
world and see what you can see standing in
that square and standing in that possibility.
56
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (to the group)
I know most of you don’t get that, but never mind. Just listen. What today and tomorrow is
about mostly is about being authentic about being inauthentic. So there are a couple of things
to get. One: you present yourself as someone who keeps your word, but in fact you are someone
who does or does not keep your word depending on whether you feel like it. Is that the truth
about you? I told you I don’t know the truth. See if it’s empowering—like trying on a robe.
Two: when you can wear that robe, that’s called being authentic about your own inauthenticity.
Always, the beginning of authenticity is being authentic about your own inauthenticity. I want
you to treat the promises in here diff erently from usual. I want you to say “regardless.” When it’s
all over, maybe you will, maybe you won’t. Sincerity is pure story. I’m asking you to engage in
these promises as a matter of integrity, not sincerity. As a matter of fact, standing in the back-
ground is always the possibility that you may not. But then you won’t, and that’s that.
At 3:12 pm, The Forum adjourned for a second break.
58
SPEAKING BEING
Dasein: Meaning and Mineness
Dasein is Martin Heidegger’s name for the central figure in his 1927 magnum opus,
Being and Time. The term is one of the few in Heidegger’s writing that consistently
remains untranslated from the German: the most literal translation of Da-Sein is be-
ing-there. Scholar Hubert Dreyfus suggests that the best way to understand Dasein
is to think of “our term ‘human being,’ which can refer to a way of being that is char-
acteristic of all people or to a specific person—a human being” (Hubert L. Dreyfus,
Being-in-the-World 14).
But the term being-there itself indicates the essential characteristic that distin-
guishes humans from other beings. Dasein is being-there because it is the only being
for whom its Being is an issue. Humans are the beings who reflect upon themselves,
and the only ones who exist in a world of meaning. We dwell in a meaningful “there,”
and we bring our “there” along with us when we show up. Other beings inhabit the
earth; human beings live in a world.
This is a challenging and essential aspect of the thinking Heidegger is devel-
oping here, and a distinction that emerges persistently over the four days of The
Forum. The meanings of the things in our world are not properties of the things
themselves. Non-human beings are “entities whose kind of Being is of a charac-
ter other than Dasein’s,” and therefore they must be understood as “unmeaning,
essentially devoid of any meaning at all” (BT 193). When Heidegger says that “only
Dasein can be meaningful or meaningless,” he is saying that other beings can have or
lack meaning only when they are encountered by Dasein and are thereby disclosed as
meaningful or not (BT 192–193). Consider: a dog may not be “a dog” for another dog,
nor may the dog see “beauty” in a sunset. Dasein is the only being in whose world
there is meaning. Only for human beings do things show up as the things they are.
Further, Dasein is the only being for whom existence is always an issue, and the
issue for each Dasein is always fundamentally its own existence. Heidegger calls this
human characteristic mineness: the Being of human beings, while it characterizes
the ontological nature of the collective, always occurs as the Being of a particular
human being. Therefore, while Dasein is not a person, we have to talk about it as if
it were: “Because Dasein has in each case mineness, one must always use a personal
pronoun when one addresses it: ‘I am,’ ‘you are’” (BT 68).
Each Dasein relates to this existential situation in a particular way. “Mineness
belongs to any existent Dasein, and belongs to it as the condition which makes
authenticity and inauthenticity possible” (BT 78, emphasis added). That is, my
SESSION TWO INTERVAL
Dasein is always mine, but whether or not that relationship is authentic—as Werner
Erhard would put it, whether I own the condition of mineness, or whether it owns
me—depends upon an act of existential choice. The purpose of The Forum is to
bring participants face-to-face with that choice, thereby making available the possi-
bility of authentic existence.

درز
شما هیچ ایده ای ندارید: او با حضور در زمان تلاش می کند. مریم
بله درز
بنابراین اکنون با او اشکالی ندارد. (خنده)
جیک
من معتقدم که اهداف مردم مهم است. بیایید نظرسنجی کنیم درز
اگر 100 سال پیش نظرسنجی را انجام دهیم ، شخصی در اینجا به عنوان جادوگر سوزانده می شود. جیک
این درست است یکی دیگر از شرکت کنندگان ، پولس ، در حالی که نشسته بود صحبت کرد. پولک
در بعضی از زبانها که وعده ها را می سازند گاهی اوقات شامل استفاده از تنش ویژه ای است که شما را می گوید
ممکن است نرسد erhard (خنده)
وقتی وارد می شوم ، اگر انجام دهم ... پل
این مشخصه زبانهای دیگر است. در اسپانیایی همه این دوران زیرزمینی وجود دارد. شما می توانید
بگویید: "وقتی این کار را برای من انجام می دهید ، من این کار را خواهم کرد." این مطیع است ، این چیزی است که ما دوباره نمی خواهیم-
در زبان ما nize. این به عنوان نظری شناخته شده است. شاید این همان چیزی باشد که شما به آن می روید. درز
نه ، این نیست ، اما آنچه شما گفتید با این وجود برای آنچه که من می گیرم مفید است: شما
خود را به عنوان شخصی معرفی کنید که آنچه را که شما گفتید انجام می دهید ، انجام می دهید ، و آنچه را که خود انجام نمی دهید انجام نمی دهید
بگو در واقع شاید شما این کار را انجام دهید و شاید نتوانید. این غیر معتبر است پولک
خوب ، من موافق نیستم روز اول انجمن: جلسه دو

درز
چرا مدتی ایستاده اید؟ پل (ایستاده و دریافت میکروفون)
برای من غیر معتبر بودن این است که بگویم شما می خواهید کاری انجام دهید بدون اینکه قصد انجام آن را داشته باشید. این برای من غیرقانونی است. درز
سعی کنید به خاطر داشته باشید که هفده سال است که با افراد تقریباً باهوش صحبت کرده ام
تو هستی و من هنوز این چیز را می گویم. من با شخص ملاقات نکرده ام ، اگرچه من با کسی ملاقات نکرده ام
به اندازه شما باهوش ... پل
و نه با کسی به اندازه شما باهوش آشنا نشده ام. درز
شما این را نمی دانید پولک
من می دانم که من نمی دانم ، اما شما نمی دانید چه می گویید. درز
اوه ، شما می خواهید برنامه خود را با من انجام دهید ، درست است؟ پولک
اوه نه ، من فقط ... erhard
صبر کن ، صبر کن من یک کلمه برای آن نمی دانم به جز "Asshole".

اگر کسی 625 دلار بپردازد تا وارد شود و مسیر من را طی کند و آنها برای انجام دوره خود وقت می گیرند
با من به صورت رایگان ، این یک لاله است. پولک
شما با کلمات بازی می کنید. درز
چه چیزی با کلمات بازی نمی کند؟ پولک
خوب هر چیزی غیر کلامی بدیهی است که با کلمات بازی نمی کند. 50
وجود
درز
واقعاً؟ آیا شما یک زبان شناس هستید؟ پولک
بله ، من به سه زبان صحبت می کنم. درز
من نپرسیدم که آیا شما به سه زبان صحبت می کنید ، من از شما پرسیدم که آیا شما زبان را درک کرده اید یا خیر. این است که
ness؟ آیا زبان تجارت شماست؟ پولک
نه ، اما من به چندین زبان صحبت می کنم. درز
چند نفر در این اتاق به چندین زبان صحبت می کنند؟ (بسیاری از دستان بلند شده)
من به افرادی که به چندین زبان صحبت می کنند احترام زیادی دارم. منظور من بی احترامی نیست ، اما
این بدان معنا نیست که شما می دانید در مورد زبان گهواره است. پولک
خوب ، زبان شامل الگوی فکری ، یک فرایند فکری است. موجود در آن است
زبانی که در درون آن فکر می کنید. همانطور که من با اسپانیایی به آن مراجعه می کردم ، شما در داخل شبکه هستید
Guage ساختاری را برای مقابله با این واقعیت که برخی از موارد فرضی هستند ، شامل می شود ، برخی
همه چیز واقعی است ... erhard (به گروه)
شما می خواهید این کار را با دقت گوش دهید ، زیرا در غیر این صورت می خواهید بایستید و این کار را انجام دهید. و من می خواهم به او اجازه دهم این کار را به اندازه کافی طولانی انجام دهد تا بتوانید ببینید که به نظر می رسد. برو به پل پولک
نکته این است که من موافقم ، که غیرقانونی بودن این است که ، شما می گویید که این است که ، انجام کاری ، به
بگویید شما می خواهید کاری انجام دهید و هیچ کس نمی داند ، من می توانم بگویم که من می خواهم به اینجا راه بروم ،
و ممکن است جهان قبل از رسیدن به آنجا به پایان برسد. درز
این حرف من نیست این چیزی نیست که من گفتم. پولک
خوب ، نکته چیست؟ روز اول انجمن: جلسه دو
51
درز
نکته این است که ، ارائه خود به یک روش و راه دیگر غیرقانونی است. پولک
بله ، این درست است درز
این همان چیزی است که من از ابتدا گفتم. مثل این است که من گفتم یکی و یک دو است ، و بعد می گویید ،
"خوب ، نه همیشه ..."
پولک
اما این قصد را ندارد. برخی از موارد در قلمرو یک شخص وجود دارد
ترول و چیزهای دیگر که نیستند. درز
شما هم در این مورد مغذی هستید. (اشاره به جیک)
من می خواهم شما اینجا گوش دهید. اکنون این را دریافت خواهیم کرد. من نمی دانم که او آن را دریافت خواهد کرد ، اما شما آن را دریافت خواهید کرد. پولک
من سعی می کنم تمایز را روشن کنم. درز
نگه داشتن من می فهمم ببینید ، نگاه کنید: من در مورد قصد چیزی نگفتم. شما آن را مطرح کردید ،
در واقع جیک بود ، اما در این گفتگو ، شما آن را مطرح کردید. پولک
بله درز
من گفتم که "غیر معتبر" این بود که خود را به یک روش ارائه دهید و راه دیگری باشید. این زیباست
خدای ساده ، اینطور نیست؟ پولک
مطمئنا ، بله درز
و آیا این غیرقانونی است؟ 52
وجود
پولک
بله ، اگر این روش شما است. درز
این همان چیزی است که من گفتم. من گفتم اگر خود را به یک روش ارائه دهید ، و واقعاً دیگری هستید

مطمئناً ، اگر به این واقعیت توجه می کنید که شما آن راه دیگری هستید. درز
خوب اگر ماه با نقاط صورتی پولکا آبی شود؟ پولک
خوب ... erhard
اگر جهان در 30 ثانیه به پایان برسد ، چطور؟ سوال من این است: چرا با اینها روبرو هستید
چیزهای کوچک در مورد عمد ، وقتی آنچه می گویم بسیار ساده است؟ پولک
خوب ، زیرا این امر دلالت دارد. درز
این به معنای چیزی نیست. اگر خود را به یک روش ارائه دهید ، وقتی در واقع راه دیگری هستید ،
این غیر معتبر است اگر می گوید طلا بر روی یک چیز مهر می زند و طلا نیست ، این غیر معتبر است. پولک
شماره erhard
این زمانی است که به یک راه خود را ارائه می دهید ، و شما یک راه دیگر هستید - این غیرقابل اطمینان است. پولک
خوب ، من موافق نیستم ، اما هنوز هم من فکر می کنم این کلمه اشتباه است erhard (به جیک) e
آیا می دانید که او با آن موافق نیست؟ جیک
آیا می توانم به آنچه می گویید پاسخ دهم؟ روز اول انجمن: جلسه دو
53
درز
آیا دریافتید که او با آن موافق نیست؟ جیک
ما دقیقاً هماهنگ نیستیم. درز
من این را درک می کنم جیک ، شما دقیقاً از همان مکان هماهنگ نیستید. (پرداختن به دو مرد)
شما هر دو نسبت به حرف خود غافلگیر هستید. او از همان چیز آمده است. اگر فکر می کردید طلا است
حرف
و شما طلا را بر روی آن مهر کردید ، سپس واقعاً طلا است. شما می شنوید که چقدر احمقانه به نظر می رسد؟ جیک
بله درز
این همان چیزی است که شما گفتید جیک
من این را نگفتم erhard (نشانگر پولس)
این همان چیزی است که او گفت. احمقانه آنچه او گفت ، اینطور نیست؟ اگر فکر می کردید طلا است و شما
حرف
طلای آن را مهر کرد ، سپس واقعاً طلا است. این چیزی است که واقعاً حساب می شود ، آنچه شما قصد داشتید. درست است؟ جیک
این امر آن را معتبر نمی کند ، اما من را ناسازگار نمی کند. این من را دروغگو نمی کند. erhard (به گروه)
من تمام این مدت را با این گلوله می گذارم زیرا می خواهم کاری را انجام دهم. بدون حصیر
آنچه را که من مطرح می کنم ، کسی در مورد آن چیزی خواهد داشت. کسی در مورد آن مغذی خواهد بود. هیچ
مهم است که آنها چه می گویند ، بدیهی است که این دو پسر باهوش هستند. اما آنها پای خود را گرفته اند
ناخن به سمت اوور ، بنابراین مثل این است که با افراد احمق صحبت کنید. گیر بودن شما را احمق می کند. وجود ندارد
برق در دسترس است که پای خود را به سمت کف زمین میخ زده اید. همه این مکالمه در مورد
قصد ، در پاسخ به اظهارات ساده من در مورد اصالت ، نشان می دهد که برخی وجود دارد
مغذی آنجا. نکته این است که در بعضی از مواقع ، شما آن شخص خواهید بود. (به جیک)
و برای حل و فصل این مکالمه: من از شما می خواهم که در آن بایستید - آن شخصی که خودش را ارائه می دهد
راه ، و در واقع به هر دلیلی عمل دیگری عمل می کند. این درست نیست این یک "گرفتن
موردی که "من از شما می خواهم که در آن بایستید. آیا این واضح است؟"
هیچ نیرویی در جایی که دارید در دسترس نیست
پای شما به زمین میخ زده است. 54
وجود
جیک تکان داد و سپس نشست. erhard (به پولس)
آیا آنچه را که به او گفتم؟ پولک
بله ، بنابراین ، آنچه شما می گویید این است که نمونه خاص شما آنچه را که گفتید انجام نداده اید ،
این ، و من در آنجا با شما موافقم ، اما ... erhard
من توافق شما را نمی خواهم. من می خواهم شما این مربع را ایجاد کنید. (ترسیم یک مربع خیالی در جلوی پل)
در داخل آن مربع دنیای متفاوتی قرار دارد. در داخل آن جهان ، هنگامی که شما به یک راه و حال عمل می کنید
خودتان به روشی دیگر ، این غیرقانونی است. پولک
خاص ، یا به طور کلی؟ درز
به طور کلی. فقط در آن جهان در سایر نقاط جهان صادق نیست. آیا می توانید از پس آن برآید؟ پولک
بله من مطمئن نیستم که در مورد چه چیزی صدق می کند ، اما ... درز
این برای هر چیزی صدق نمی کند. آیا می توانید از پس آن برآید؟ پولک
بله درز
در آن مربع بایستید و به آنچه بعد می گویم گوش دهید. زیرا فقط در آنجا ایستاده است آنچه من هستم
در مورد گفتن هر معنی. خوب؟ شما آماده ایستادن در آن میدان هستید؟ (به پل)
شما آماده هستید؟ بنابراین در آن میدان کوچک ، من می دانم که این درست نیست ، و در بقیه موارد اینگونه نیست
جهان ، و برای کسانی که یک و یک نفر برای آنها دو هستند ، وقتی وانمود می کنید یک راه و عمل می کنید
دیگری ، که غیرقانونی است. وقتی این کار را دارید ، این در مورد شما معتبر است
عدم صحت کسی آن را دریافت نکرده است؟ این آغاز اصالت است. اصالت ندارد
صحت
در اینجا Erhard یک ضد انعطاف پذیر اما بسیار هایدگر را فراهم می کند
فرض: اصالت فقط با توسعه امکان پذیر است
یک رابطه معتبر با عدم اعتماد به نفس خودمان. در اینجا
اصالت یک عمل مالکیت ، داشتن محاسبات است
پاکسازی که ما هستیم ، از پذیرش هدیه خاص بودن بودن
ارسال آن دوره ما را توصیف می کند. هایدگر معرفی کرد
این ایده در وجود و زمان ، جایی که او این اصطلاح را به کار گرفت
"قاطعانه" برای توصیف وضعیت داسین-
اختصاص داده شده وی این قاطع را به عنوان یک توانمند توصیف کرد
اصالت نسبت به عدم اعتماد به نفس شخص:
قاطعانه مناسب بودن را به طور نامحسوس-
از نظر Dasein در حال حاضر در معرض مقاومت نیست ،
و به زودی ، شاید دوباره در آن قرار بگیرد. بشر بشر بشر در
عدم تحمل "آنها"
علی رغم ، اما نمی تواند تحمیل شود
وجود قاطع (BT 345)
"
این ایده در قلب رویداد اختصاصی نهفته است: در
زمینه تخصیص عدم اعتماد به نفس فرد ، که
عدم اطمینان ، که همچنان ادامه دارد ، با این وجود دگرگون می شود. این ایده ای است که از تفکر معمول ما سرپیچی می کند: به صورت بینایی ، چنین
"تحول" فقط می تواند به عنوان توجیهی آشکار تلقی شود ، a
عقلانیت پیچیده فلسفی برای پذیرش شخص
بدترین طبیعت با این حال ، از نظر هستی شناختی ، تخصیص توجیه می شود
هیچی تخصیص اختصاصی ؛ این وجود را می دهد. قاطعانه ،
سپس ، "افتتاح انسان ، از اسارت آن است
آنچه که ، به باز بودن بودن "(" OWA "در PLT 67).
از این انجمن به توسعه امکان غیر
رویداد توجیهی تخصیص. ■
روز اول انجمن: جلسه دو

با اصالت بودن شروع کنید. اصالت با اصالت در مورد عدم اطمینان شما شروع می شود. اگر می خواهید هر درجه از اصالت داشته باشید ، تنها راه رسیدن به آنجا شروع به کار است
معتبر بودن در مورد عدم اعتماد به نفس خود. (به گروه)
من به سیستم های اعتقادی شما علاقه ای ندارم ، من به ارزشهای شما علاقه ای ندارم ، من علاقه ای ندارم
اصول شما بنابراین دیگر مکالمه هایی مانند من فقط با جیک و پاول انجام داده ام. منظور من نیست
هر چیزی بگویید ، منظورم این است که موعظه نکنید. من همه موعظه ها را در اینجا انجام خواهم داد ، و اگر من خوب هستم ، من نخواهم داشت
هر یک را انجام دهید. تمام آنچه من می پرسم وقتی در مورد چیزهایی که در مورد آنها صحبت می کنم با شما صحبت می کنم این است: ساخت
یک مربع ، در داخل آن بایستید ، به زندگی و جهان نگاه کنید و ببینید چه چیزی می توانید ایستاده ببینید
در آن مربع و در آن امکان ایستاده است. اگر این امکان را به شما می دهد که در آنجا بایستید ، آن را نگه دارید. اگر
شما را قادر نمی سازد در آنجا بایستید ، آن را نابود کنید. ساده قله
شما به شخص دیگری گفتید که هنگام کودکی اتفاقی افتاده است. یادم آمد من
پدر دروغگو بود و من تصمیم گرفتم که هرگز نمی توانم چنین باشم. من باید صادق باشم من آزادی ندارم
حرف من را نگه دارید درز
شما نمی توانید هر چیزی باشید که مجبور به آن هستید. هر چیزی که مجبور شوید باشید ، نیستید. قله
من نمی توانم این احساس را تحمل کنم. درز
بله (به گروه)
چه کسی نمی تواند دروغگو باشد؟ (چند نفر دست خود را بالا می برند)
شما فکر می کنید یک گوینده حقیقت می تواند کاملاً ناامید شود؟ برای شخصی که می گوید
حقیقت شما با دروغ مشکلی ندارید ، فقط کسی در باتلاق است ، در ربات
تام دره سایه مرگ ، که می ترسد آنها ممکن است دروغگو باشند. من می دانم که شما می دانید
بهتر قله
من دروغگو هستم درز
بله شما دروغگو هستید این معتبر بودن در مورد عدم اعتماد به نفس است. و این آغاز است
اصالت - و آغاز آزادی برای گفتن حقیقت. "
تمام آنچه را که می پرسم وقتی با شما در مورد صحبت می کنم
چیزهایی که من در مورد آنها صحبت می کنم این است: یک مربع بسازید ،
در داخل آن بایستید ، به زندگی و
جهان و ببینید چه چیزی می توانید در آن ایستاده اید
آن مربع و در آن امکان ایستاده است. 56
وجود
erhard (به گروه)
من می دانم که بیشتر شما آن را دریافت نمی کنید ، اما هرگز به آن توجه نکنید. فقط گوش کن امروز و فردا چیست
بیشتر در مورد اصالت بودن در مورد عدم اعتماد به نفس است. بنابراین چند مورد وجود دارد
برای گرفتن یکی: شما خود را به عنوان کسی معرفی می کنید که حرف خود را نگه می دارد ، اما در واقع شما کسی هستید
چه کسی بسته به اینکه احساس می کنید کلمه شما را نگه می دارد یا نمی کند. این حقیقت است
در مورد شما؟ من به شما گفتم که من حقیقت را نمی دانم. ببینید که آیا این قدرتمند است - مانند تلاش برای یک لباس. دو: هنگامی که می توانید آن لباس را بپوشید ، این به نام معتبر بودن در مورد عدم اعتماد به نفس خود است. همیشه ، آغاز اصالت در مورد عدم صحت خود معتبر است. من می خواهم
شما باید با وعده های موجود در اینجا رفتار کنید. من می خواهم شما بگویید "بدون در نظر گرفتن". وقتی
در همه جا ، شاید شما بخواهید ، شاید شما پیروز نشوید. اخلاص داستان خالص است. من از شما می خواهم که درگیر شوید
این وعده ها به عنوان یک مسئله یکپارچگی ، نه اخلاص. در واقع ، ایستاده در پشت-
زمین همیشه این احتمال است که ممکن است نباشید. اما پس از آن شما پیروز نخواهید شد ، و این همان است. ساعت 3:12 بعد از ظهر ، این مجمع برای یک استراحت دوم به تعویق افتاد. 58
وجود
dasein: معنی و خردمندی
Dasein نام مارتین هایدگر برای چهره اصلی در مگنوم اوپوس در سال 1927 است ،
بودن و زمان این اصطلاح یکی از معدود مواردی است که در نوشتن هایدگر است که به طور مداوم
از آلمانی ترجمه نشده است: لفظی ترین ترجمه دا-Sein است
در اینجا Scholar Hubert Dreyfus پیشنهاد می کند که بهترین راه برای درک Dasein
فکر کردن به "اصطلاح" انسان "است که می تواند به روشی برای موجودی اشاره کند
acteristic از همه افراد یا به یک شخص خاص - یک انسان "(هوبرت ال. دریفوس ،
بودن در جهان 14). اما اصطلاح موجود در آن نشان دهنده ویژگی اساسی است-
انسان را از موجودات دیگر غافل می کند. Dasein در حال موجود است-زیرا این تنها موجود است
برای چه کسی وجود آن است. انسانها موجوداتی هستند که به خودشان تأمل می کنند ،
و تنها کسانی که در دنیایی از معنا وجود دارند. ما در یک "آنجا" معنی دار زندگی می کنیم
و وقتی حضور پیدا می کنیم ، "آنجا" را با خود همراه می کنیم. موجودات دیگر ساکن هستند
زمین انسان در دنیایی زندگی می کند. این یک جنبه چالش برانگیز و اساسی از تفکر هایدگر است-
در اینجا ، و تمایزی که به طور مداوم در طی چهار روز از آن ظهور می کند
انجمن. معانی چیزهای موجود در جهان ما خواص چیزها نیست
خودشان موجودات غیر انسانی "موجوداتی هستند که نوع آن از یک کاراکتر است
به غیر از Dasein ، "و بنابراین آنها باید به عنوان" Unmeaning "درک شوند.
اساساً عاری از هر معنایی نیست "(Bt 193). وقتی هایدگر می گوید" فقط
Dasein می تواند معنی دار یا بی معنی باشد. "او می گوید موجودات دیگر می توانند یا
عدم معنی فقط در شرایطی که آنها با داسین روبرو می شوند و از این طریق فاش می شوند
معنی دار یا نه (Bt 192-193). در نظر بگیرید: یک سگ ممکن است برای سگ دیگری "سگ" نباشد ،
سگ نمی تواند "زیبایی" را در غروب خورشید ببیند. داسین تنها موجودی است که در جهان است
معنی وجود دارد فقط برای انسانها کارهایی را انجام می دهند که چیزهایی هستند که هستند. علاوه بر این ، Dasein تنها موجودی است که وجود آن همیشه یک مسئله است و
مسئله برای هر dasein همیشه اساساً وجود خودش است. هایدگر این را صدا می کند
مشخصه مشخصه انسان: وجود انسان ، در حالی که توصیف می کند
ماهیت هستی شناختی جمعی ، همیشه به عنوان وجود خاص رخ می دهد
انسان بنابراین ، در حالی که داسین شخصی نیست ، ما باید در مورد آن صحبت کنیم که گویی
این بود: "از آنجا که داسین در هر مورد دارای اعتبار است ، همیشه باید از شخصی استفاده کند
ضمیر وقتی یکی به آن خطاب می کند: "من هستم" ، "تو هستی" (BT 68). هر dasein به روشی خاص مربوط به این وضعیت وجودی است. "جین بودن
متعلق به هر دازین موجود است و به عنوان شرایطی که ایجاد می کند متعلق به آن است
اصالت و عدم اطمینان ممکن است "(BT 78 ، تأکید اضافه شده است). یعنی من
جلسه دو فاصله
Dasein همیشه مال من است ، اما این که آیا این رابطه معتبر است یا نه - به عنوان ورنر
erhard آن را بیان می کند ، خواه من شرایط خردمندی را داشته باشم ، یا اینکه آیا مالک آن است
من - به عمل انتخابی وجود دارد. هدف از انجمن این است که
شرکت کنندگان
بیت موجودیت معتبر.
