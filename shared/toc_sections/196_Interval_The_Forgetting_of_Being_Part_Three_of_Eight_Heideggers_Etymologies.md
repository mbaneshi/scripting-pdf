SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
See, you got hurt, didn’t you, when you were growing up?
ANDY
Yeah.
KIPP
See how you said “yeah”? So today your job is to get present to your own life. And you gloss
over it by saying you’re a sleaze. People aren’t interested in things, people are interested in you.
We give people things, we don’t give them our selves. You’re a guy walking around with a chip
on your shoulder, and the chip has become your life.
ANDY
Right.
ERHARD (coming forward)
Hold on, hold on a minute. A lot of people in here with a chip on their shoulder. How many
people in here have a chip on their shoulder? I’m looking around here to see if the right hands
are up.
Erhard pointed out a couple of people to indicate that they needed to have their hands raised. He
addressed one of them.
(continuing)
That costs you your beauty, you know that? You’re a beautiful woman. Nobody can see that
with that fucking chip on your shoulder; takes your power away from you.
KIPP
Anything more?
ANDY
Just that it is so powerful.
KIPP
Right. The chip on your shoulder uses your life.
ANDY
Like a drug.
KIPP
Thank you.
(applause)
Forum Day Three: Session One
183
KIPP (to the group)
I’m inviting you to keep being present to sharing.
XAVIER
I called my girlfriend. I think I’m getting things. I kid myself about getting things, and I don’t
know shit.
KIPP
Yeah. What do you do in life?
XAVIER
I’m a student.
KIPP
Of course, you have to be a student if you don’t know shit... Somebody that doesn’t know shit
has to be a student—because you can’t be present to “I don’t know.” If you can get that you’re
reporting when you’re reporting—that’s worth the four days... “I was talking about rackets” is
reporting. “I said I was full of shit” is sharing. And what did your girlfriend say?
XAVIER
That I was just reporting on things.
KIPP
Listen. That’s worth his four days. If you can get that you’re reporting when you’re reporting,
it’s worth the four days. And?
XAVIER
I said that I am full of shit; I am running rackets all the time.
KIPP
She said?
XAVIER
She shared about how uncomfortable it is to be called on her rackets. It’s embarrassing.
KIPP
Being alive is embarrassing. If you don’t want to be embarrassed, stay dead.
ERHARD
It’s embarrassing to be yourself. Ask any teenager, he’ll tell you. That’s why teenagers put an
act together. It’s innately embarrassing to be yourself. That’s how you get to be an adult when
you’re a teenager. You learn not to be yourself. It’s true about everybody in the room. You want
to get that. It’s embarrassing to be yourself.

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
You start participating in your own life, it’s going to be awkward and embarrassing for you. It
took about three years to train me. I was too embarrassed to be with people.
(prompting Xavier to keep sharing rather than describing)
And you said? And she said?
XAVIER
We broke up on Tuesday.
KIPP
Good. Always break up before The Forum. You might get lucky in here.
(laughter)
Careful. You’re having fun. It might be a shock to your system.
(laughter)
XAVIER
I’m sitting here during The Forum having these thoughts.
KIPP
No, the thoughts are having you. And the thoughts say?
XAVIER
I’m a worthless piece of shit.
Kipp crossed the platform to the table, picked up a box of tissues, and used the tissues to demonstrate
Xavier’s “thoughts” that he was “identifying with,” and “being owned by.” Kipp did this by pulling
a tissue from the box, wafting it through the air, and inserting it into one of his nostrils, and then
another in the other nostril, to much laughter.
KIPP (with tissues in his nostrils, regarding Xavier)
And you go?
XAVIER
I’ll never amount to anything.
KIPP (fi lling both ears with tissues; laughter)
And the next thought?
XAVIER
It’s hopeless.
Forum Day Three: Session One
185
KIPP (covering his head with a tissue; laughter)
This is what you’ve been calling you.
XAVIER
I see the payoff s and the costs, but now what?
KIPP
Two more days, that’s what.
Xavier sat down looking considerably lighter than when he had stood up. Another participant, Edna,
stood next.
EDNA
When I came in here I had a bag of negatives with me.
KIPP
“A bag of negatives” is a description.
EDNA
I didn’t want to be here. I have six children and grandchildren in this Forum. I thought we were
all going to do The Forum together. It didn’t take me long to realize that they were going to do
their Forum and I was going to do my Forum. I kept looking for where in the room my family
was. At one point, I saw my son walking toward the door. I feared for his and my looking good. I
realized how much looking good had been running my life. It’s not anymore.
KIPP
It is anymore. It is there. But you’ve got some choice now in how it uses you.
(to the group)
What you’re listening to is a mother whose children became trophies.
ERHARD
Like all mothers: you lose yourself. You become your children. Let me tell you something: you
have very little to do with the way your children grow up. Look at yourself. You did it the way
you wanted to do it. But everyone has bullshit about “They made me.” Kids like to eat. “If you
want to eat in this house, do this and this and this. If you don’t want to eat, do something else.”
I told my son, “I don’t feed you because I love you. It’s against the law not to feed you.” You
lose yourself and become your children. The single most important thing you have to give your
children is your own well-being, and make sure they don’t get in the way. They may not use it
wisely, but your self is what you’ve got to give them. The one thing I could never get away from
with my mother was who she was. But I forgot everything she told me.
EDNA
They didn’t know the reason for me wanting them to look good: so that I would look good.
AWAKENING ATTUNEMENTS
Werner Erhard has consistently denied that his work is
appropriately characterized by the term philosophy. But he
has issued this denial in a cultural context where philosophy is
generally regarded as a purely academic pursuit, in which one
studies the thinking of great thinkers in order to gain knowledge
and perhaps thereby to attain wisdom.
The people who direct this study are professors of philosophy,
but are rarely considered publicly to be themselves philosophers;
our culture has no clear or off icial requirements for that desig-
nation. The academic process generally entails learning about
philosophy, not doing philosophy. This is not necessarily the
aim of the professors, but arises from the constricting assump-
tions of the current paradigm that structures the processes of
acquiring knowledge within academic settings. Given this way of
understanding the term “philosophy,” it clearly does not describe
Erhard’s methodology.
But certainly, as Erhard has acknowledged, his work does
address many of the concerns of philosophy (“The Heart of the
Matter”), concerns that are likewise central in the work of Martin
Heidegger, who is considered as off icial a “philosopher” as anyone
from the twentieth century. In Germany during the prime of his
career, between 1920 and the 1960s, Heidegger was immersed
in a culture that revered both the academic system itself and in
particular the academic discipline of philosophy. In responding to
this opportunity, he rose to pre-eminence as an academic and as a
philosopher. (Please see Michael E. Zimmerman’s Aft erword to this
