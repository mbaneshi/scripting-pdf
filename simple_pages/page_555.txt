say, especially those who are most critical about what we propose to do. Heedless
confidence in your own way of being the one that will perfect the world, as was the
case in totalitarian movements of the twentieth century, is almost certainly a recipe
for disaster. New worlds must be built together with people from a wide variety of 
perspectives, pre-modern, modern, and post-modern.

In the foregoing book, Hyde and Kopp have threaded the needle. They have showed 
that Heidegger’s work has important parallels with ideas that Erhard arrived at on 
his own, and they have done so in a way that leaves no room for ascribing either 
far-right-wing or far-left -wing views to Erhard. Although he may be an existentialist, 
he is also a modernist, unlike Heidegger.  I regard Speaking Being as an enormous-
ly important contribution to understanding Heidegger and Erhard. The latter has 
received far too little serious academic attention, and this book begins to make up 
for that lack. Moreover, the book’s analysis of Heidegger’s thought is among the best 
that I have ever read. I commend this book to all readers without reservation.
