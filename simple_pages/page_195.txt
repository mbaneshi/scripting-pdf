Forum Day Three: Session One

ERHARD (to the group)
You’ve got to have advanced training to know that about yourself.
ANDY
My life’s been about being a sleaze. The question was “what do you care most about in life?” 
and I said “I care about making a diff erence with people.” And I see that isn’t it. I care about 
making a diff erence with young people and I could give a fuck about adults. And my actions 
show that. So who I am with an adult is a snake in the grass.
ERHARD
That’s pretty popular. I’m for this and the hell with everything else. That doesn’t give you any 
power with what you’re for.
ANDY (replaying a conversation he had)
So she said, “what do you get out of that?” I said, “well, I get to look good. Mr. morality. Mr. 
right. Look like I’m honest—all the good stuff  that goes along with it. It was all fun and games 
at fi rst.” “What’s the cost?” “I don’t see no cost. Maybe self-expression. Tell people what I’m 
really thinking because I’m being manipulative.” “Well what about love?” “I could give a fuck 
about love: I’ve got my family. I got all the love I need.” And then she said, “how could you do 
what you do? You fucking hurt people, you use people, you lie. How would you feel if someone 
was doing that to you all the time? And that’s all you’re doing.” And it does hurt. It hurts deep 
inside. I was denying it.
KIPP (moving closer to Andy)
You were doing what you’ve done your entire life. 
ANDY
I’m not denying it anymore. I am a sleaze.
KIPP
Being a sleaze is a nice handy phrase that doesn’t let you be present to what’s there in your life. 
ANDY
I don’t trust adults.
KIPP 
That’s a concept. “I don’t trust adults” is saying information about it. 
(clapping his hands) 
That sound is present. What’s present when you’re with adults? 
ANDY
I don’t know.
