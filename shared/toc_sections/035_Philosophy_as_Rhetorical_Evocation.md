Forum Day One: Session One
21
DORIS
Okay.
She sat. A man rose to object to Erhard’s earlier assertion that our ways of being, such as nervous-
ness, own us.
FOSTER
I understand that being nervous is a human quality. Why don’t I own being nervous? Isn’t that
a quality of me?
ERHARD
Where is this quality?
FOSTER (pointing to his heart)
Here, and it’s pounding!
ERHARD
My dog’s heart pounds. You and I explain things about people by assigning qualities to them.
But this may not be eff ective if what you want to do is have access to the things you’re explain-
ing. The language we use every day is designed to explain things. The language we use in here
is designed to gain access to things. So it’s a diff erent language. Explanations give no access to
power. If you want power and access, we’re going to invent such a language in here. I’m not
limited to merely reporting the way I am. I’m an anti-quality-ist. You ain’t got any qualities
inside you. Qualities are an explanatory principle. It won’t hold up on closer examination.
Erhard was now in the aisle, moving among the participants. One rose to defend the importance of
having what he called self-beliefs.
RAY
How does one hold beliefs about oneself and about reality in a way to be powerful and creative?
ERHARD
One of the ways is to not have any beliefs. Does anyone need to believe that the fl oor is there?
You don’t need to have any belief about the fl oor and it works just fi ne. And if you didn’t have
any beliefs about gravity it would work just fi ne. You only need to believe in things that you
doubt. The only problem with belief is that you can’t think about anything you believe.
k
RAY
I have an interpretation about myself, and how do I hold that interpretation?
ERHARD
As an interpretation.
Being-in articulates an essentially different relationship
from the one we usually have in mind when we say something is
“in” something. If we say “the water is in the glass,” for example,
the two phenomena being related have a prior and individual
existence in space: the water was there, and the glass was there.
We have simply put one in the other. Further, as Heidegger points
out, we can easily extend such relationships outward: the glass is
on the table, the table is in the kitchen, the kitchen is in the house,
and so on, until finally we can say that the water is in “world
space” (BT 79).
T
Objects such as the glass and the table are, in Heidegger’s
vocabulary, “things occurring ‘within’ the world” (BT 79).
T
Therefore they have a different kind of being from Dasein. The
table and the glass are whats; their characteristics are categorical.
While the table and the glass can have a location-relationship
within the world, the water is not in the glass in the same way that
a human being is in-the-world.
Dasein, on the other hand, is a who, and its characteristics
are existential, which define an existence structure quite different
from that of a table. This is, of course, on one level obvious.
But Heidegger, remember, is languaging a view of the world
that is very different from our everyday way of understanding
things. Therefore he is rigorous in setting out the terminological
differences between states of being.
A chair can be next to the wall, but the chair can never touch
the wall, “even if the space between them should be equal to
zero” (BT 81). Heidegger is not making a sensory distinction but
T
an ontological one. To touch is to encounter meaningfully, and
such meaningful encounters are possible only for entities with
meaning. In Heidegger’s vocabulary, a table and a chair are
worldless.
Werner Erhard can be seen as distinguishing worldlessness
early in The Forum, in his interactions with participants on the
subject of whether the rain falls in order to water the flowers. In
doing so, he is beginning to create an understanding of meaning
as a human characteristic, rather than an aspect of the things out
there in the world. This distinction will be further developed later
22
SPEAKING BEING
RAY
Thank you.
Shortly before the fi rst break of the morning, Erhard introduced a new topic:
ERHARD
The next subject is the matter of your being here. At the upcoming break, you will be given an
opportunity to leave and have your money refunded. You want to listen up! I’m going to give
you the opportunity not to be here. You shouldn’t be here if you didn’t put yourself here. The
Forum won’t work for you anyhow, so you’re wasting your time here. You shouldn’t be here if
you’re here because you were threatened. We don’t allow people to participate in The Forum
who were coerced or threatened. You may have been here on that basis up till now. You can
leave now and you’ll get all your money back. And if you’ll get in trouble with whoever you’re
here for, I’ll write a note that says that you begged and pleaded and tried to stay here and I
threw you out. If you’re here because you were pressured into being here, would you stand up
please?
(one participant stood)
Anybody else?
(another long pause as another stood)
I’m going to say “Anybody else?” fi ve more times.
Eventually several people stood in response to his request, and he began to interact with them
individually. The interactions varied strikingly in their tone. With the fi rst participant, a teenager
named Kathy, Erhard’s manner was quite gentle. He moved closer to her, standing at a distance of
about four feet. Before beginning the conversation, he asked her if she was willing to interact with
him in front of the group, acknowledging that it might be “scary” for her to do so. He then reiterat-
ed his assertion that pressure, like embarrassment and hustle, was a clearing she was bringing to
the circumstances:
ERHARD (continuing)
I know that if you’re here because somebody pressured you to be here, that that’s an issue in
your life. The only people who experience being pressured about The Forum are those for
whom pressure is an issue. I’m giving you the opportunity to make a choice. Now that I’ve
given you the choice, would you like to leave or would you like to be here? There will be no bad
results from you leaving. You’ll get your money back.
KATHY
That’s good. I feel like I have the opportunity to choose now, whereas, before, I didn’t feel like
that.
on the first day when participants’ stories about the events in
their lives are distinguished from the events themselves.
Human beings exist in a world of meaning, and their
relationship with that world is fundamental. In-ness is an aspect
of Dasein’s existence from the ground up. Consider: a human
being never exists as a (meaningful) human being until she exists
in-the-world, and when she leaves the world (dies), she ceases to
exist (as a human being). Heidegger’s German term for the Being-
in relationship (Sein bei) carries the implication of what we would
call being at home (BT 80, note 3). Dasein is at home in the world,
T
Being-with others. “Being-with” is examined in the first sidebar of
Session One of Day Two, and we address the “world” of Being-in-
the-world at the beginning of Session One of Day Four. ■
Forum Day One: Session One
23
ERHARD
I only do this work with people for whom it’s going to be successful, so I’m not willing to do
this work except on the basis that people chose to be here. What’s your choice?
KATHY
I choose to be in The Forum.
ERHARD
No coercion? That’s your choice? Made freely?
KATHY
Yes.
ERHARD
Thank you for going through the process in front of all these people.
Along with Kathy, two other people sat down. The only participant who remained standing was a
young man in the front row named Bill, who spoke as soon as an assistant got a microphone to him:
BILL (angrily)
I think there’s kind of a thin line between choice and being compelled to do something because
someone cared enough to continuously call me up and get me here.
ERHARD (moving in to a face-to-face stance with Bill)
You’re an asshole, and somebody...
BILL
Your language is bad.
ERHARD
It’s much worse than you think it is. You don’t want to fuck with me.
BILL
You don’t scare me.
ERHARD
You’re in my game, my friend, you don’t want to fuck with me.
BILL
Someone should use language to try to clear a point.
ERHARD
I understand what you believe. I’m not interested.
24
SPEAKING BEING
BILL
That’s quite obvious.
ERHARD
Now do you have something to say that’s thoughtful? Because I’m not interested in your beliefs.
BILL
You’re competing with me in your lack of thoughtfulness in the terminology that you use on a
regular basis, my friend.
ERHARD
Really?
BILL
Yes. Thoughtfulness is as thoughtfulness does. To be thoughtful I would expect a mutual kind
of communication.
ERHARD
You got a mutual kind of communication. You got bullshit for bullshit.
BILL
Thank you very much. You are quite impressive.
ERHARD
Thank you. Are you here because you were pressured into being here?
BILL
I drove here.
ERHARD
I understand. Were you pressured into being here? I know you’re not here because you were
pressured into being here. I can take one look at you and know that wasn’t true. I know you’re
up there to fuck with me.
BILL
Now...
ERHARD
Hold on, let me talk for a while. So you’re going to tell me the story about people called you a
lot of times and people kept inviting you and kept saying you were supposed to. Understand?
That’s the story you’re going to tell me and I already know the story. You won’t be the fi rst
person with that story. This is a story I’ve heard a lot of times. Now why was I bad with you
MOOD
Heidegger’s masterwork, Being and Time, presents a model of
human being that focuses on our lived, everyday experience. This
“average everydayness,” he says, has been generally disregarded
in attempts to understand our nature. It is so apparent and well-
known to us that we fail to recognize the ontological significance
of its elements. One of these elements is mood.
Mood, or state-of-mind (
d Befindlichkeit) is a manifestation of
the moment-to-moment way one is automatically attuned to the
world. My mood provides a context—a background environment—
in which I move; it pervades and colors my relationship to
whatever I am up to at any moment, for instance, when Erhard
says “your pessimism is you.” In bad moods, “Dasein becomes
blind to itself” (BT 175). And while we may not notice it, says
T
Heidegger, a human being always has some mood, even when its
specific nature is elusive:
The pallid, evenly balanced lack of mood,
which is oft en persistent and which is not to be
mistaken for a bad mood, is far from nothing
at all. Rather, it is in this that Dasein becomes
satiated with itself. Being has become
manifest as a burden. Why that should be, one
does not know.
w (BT 173)
T
“
Furthermore, “when we master a mood, we do so by way
of a counter-mood; we are never free of moods” (BT 175). Mood
T
is the persistent background of our lives. Our moods come over
us, and our cognition cannot reach their source: “The pure ‘that
it is’ shows itself, but the ‘whence’ and the ‘whither’ remain in
darkness” (BT 173).
T
This last point will be seen as significant as The Forum
approaches its climax: we are always brought before ourselves
Forum Day One: Session One
25
just now? Because I want to get this story up. There’s a lot of people with that story here and
I want to get that story killed. I got people’s attention here. I got your attention too, but more
important: I got their attention.
(to the group)
I know you’ve got a story about how you got here. That’s your story. I don’t know what the truth
is. I know Bill was a pain in the ass.
BILL
Thank you.
ERHARD
You were, and you probably are most of the time. Do other people in here know you?
BILL
I’m not sure.
ERHARD
If I had a group of your friends here and asked them, “can Bill be a real pain in the ass?” what
would they say?
BILL
Well I imagine if they pushed me to extremes...
(laughter)
ERHARD (shaking his head)
Wait, wait. That’s not what I mean. I mean, if I said to your friends, “can Bill be a real pain in
the ass?” what would they say? I would bet they would say “yes.” More than infrequently.
BILL
What about your friends?
ERHARD
Let me explain something to you.
BILL
You put me on the spot, why can’t I put you on the spot?
ERHARD
I didn’t pay to be in here, you did. Because you invested $625 to come to my seminar. But if I
leave here and I’m still an asshole, I didn’t lose anything. If you’ve got a seminar that keeps you
in our moods, but we tend to turn away from what they might
reveal. In moods, we find ourselves, but “in a way of finding which
arises not so much from a direct seeking as rather from a fleeing”
(BT 174). In our assured, everyday way of speaking, we dismiss
T
a state-of-mind, or rather, an attunement, as “just a mood I’m
in.” But in doing so, we evade a more primordial disclosure, an
understanding which stares us in the face “with the inexorability
of an enigma” (BT 175).
T
At this early point in the proceedings, Erhard is making two
important moves. First, he is suggesting to the participants that
the nature of their moods is not what they have taken them to
be. They are not a product of the circumstances, but are instead
an aspect of their own way of being. Second, he is urging the
participants not to attempt to avoid or transcend their moods,
however uncomfortable they may seem, but rather to allow them,
and to bring them into The Forum so that they can be part of the
process. As The Forum proceeds, these suggestions will be seen
as crucial to the development of the ontological dialogue. ■

SPEAKING BEING
from being an asshole, send me a fl yer, and I will decide if that’s the seminar that’ll handle my
being an asshole.
BILL
You know I have to say something. The only value I’ve gotten so far is entertainment from your
cynicism.
ERHARD
You remember when I said you would be sitting there with your judgments and assessments?
BILL
Believe me, I’m here with an open mind.
This interaction, which was in its early moments the most belligerent of the entire four days, grad-
ually became playful. Bill began to smile, and the dialogue assumed the character of good-natured
sparring.
ERHARD
Back to the issue of pressure. Did you get a lot of phone calls?
BILL
From one lady in particular. During the process I was trying to prospect her into something
and in the end she prospected me into something.
(laughter)
ERHARD
I’m not going to ask what you were prospecting her into. But at any rate there was a lady who
called you a number of times.
BILL
She’s married, Werner.
ERHARD
It’s hard to have this conversation with you with your foot nailed to the fl oor. How many times
did she call?
BILL
I don’t know. A half dozen to a dozen times. Perhaps more.
ERHARD
And what did you say to her when she called to talk about The Forum?
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day One: Session One
27
BILL
I appreciated her concern about my welfare.
ERHARD
Did you really, or were you bullshitting her?
BILL
No.
ERHARD
So you never told her “no,” right?
BILL
Never directly “no.”
ERHARD (turning to the group)
I’m revealing the nature of pressure. That’s what Bill and I are having this conversation
about. Nobody does The Forum because they were pressured into it.
(Erhard placed his hands on Bill’s head and pushed down)
That’s what pressure is. But what had the people from the Center done? They called you. They
spoke to you. What else did they do? They stayed engaged in the conversation with you because
you never said no.
BILL
They called me every day.
ERHARD
Every day?
BILL
Well, maybe every other day.
ERHARD (to the group)
You all have a story, and your story is as full of shit as Bill’s. And I’m using language that’s
clear enough for everybody to understand.
(to Bill)
Bill, because you’ve been carrying this load for everyone, you can leave now whatever your
reason.
28
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (pausing)
You’ve got a story called pressure. You’ve got a story and then there’s what happened.
BILL
I just want to say that I was disillusioned by the salesmanship involved in getting me into the
program...
ERHARD (interrupting)
What is this salesmanship?
BILL
Let me fi nish my sentence!
ERHARD
I’m not interested in your fi nishing your sentence when it’s bullshit.
BILL
Bullshit fl ows both ways.
(laughter)
ERHARD
What is this salesmanship you’re talking about? You wouldn’t have been called any more if
you’d said no. You said “Call me some more.”
(turning to the group)
If you think you were pressured, I want you to stop lying about it and tell the truth about what
happened or get out of here.
BILL
Why don’t you look at me? These people aren’t interested in being entertained by you on my
eccentricities.
ERHARD
Bill, I’m more likely to know what they’re interested in than you. Are you able to make a choice
about being here now that you’ve got a choice?
BILL (stammering)
Some of what you’ve done is off ensive to me. I might get something. I don’t know.
ERHARD
Would you make that choice for me?
Forum Day One: Session One 29
Hesitantly, Bill sat down.
ERHARD
Do I take that to mean that you’ve chosen to be here?
BILL
Yes.
ERHARD (to the group)
All Bill’s doing is doing you a favor. He’s letting you see yourself. That’s an extraordinary gift,
to see yourself.
(turning back to Bill)
I want to apologize to you for saying things that you found off ensive. Do you accept my
apology?
BILL
Yes, I do.
ERHARD
I’m not clear you’re here because you chose to be here.
BILL
Yes. But I’m not clear if I’ll get the results.
ERHARD
And you won’t be. How The Forum works is you learn nothing. And then you learn more noth-
ing. And then you learn it all at once. It’s an all of a sudden phenomenon.
(pausing)
What we just went through is very important. I brought something to that conversation that’s
designed to leave you in a diff erent place about those conversations. I predict that when The
Forum is over you’ll tell me this was the most important experience in your whole life. We’ll
see. There’s a bit of a risk here, and I accept that.
Erhard fi nally left Bill, and addressed the group, moving among them.
ERHARD
Nobody participates in programs that I lead because they were pressured. A lot of people are
here because they’ve got reasons to be here. And I want you to know you’re not here because
of your reasons. You put yourself in that chair, and not your reasons. You’ve got a story called
force, and what actually happened was somebody spoke to you. If you live in a story called
force, your life will look like a response to force. See, most of you live in response to a story you
made up. You live in a sea of reasons. But I want you to be clear, you put yourself in that chair,
“
If you live in a story called force, your life
will look like a response to force.
NOTE: Please see the final conversation Erhard has with Bill
near the close of Session Three of Day Four.
