Praise for Speaking Being
xi
Authors Hyde and Kopp accomplish the formidable task of masterfully presenting
Erhard and Heidegger side by side in a readable, lively, and illuminating text. There
is nothing quite like it!
JERONIMA (JERI) ECHEVERRIA, Professor of History and Provost Emerita, California
State University at Fresno, former Executive Vice-Chancellor for Academic Aff airs of
the California State University System
Educational research confirms that without a significant intervention, students
who become teachers are likely to replicate the pedagogical approaches their
teachers used with them. Practicing Erhard‚Äôs approach to ontological inquiry‚Äî
presented in print for the first time in this book‚Äîprovides such an intervention.
It equips students, teachers, academics of any field to critically examine their
dispositions and access more eff ective ways of being and acting. Speaking Being is
a must read for scholars of social foundations of education, teacher education, and
frankly, for members of any field of study.
CAROLYNE J. WHITE, Professor of Social Foundations, Department of Urban
Education, Rutgers University Newark
A diff erent you and a diff erent me must show up each day if we are going to
tackle the world‚Äôs most vexing problems. This book talks us through a process of
transformation by showing us what it means to be an authentic human being in an
inauthentic world, and what it means to take a stand for a world where everyone
matters and where everyone can make a diff erence.

This engaging study of Erhard‚Äôs counter-discursive approach to transformational
education‚Äîand how this approach aligns significantly with Heidegger‚Äôs thinking‚Äî
might serve as a starting point for a deeper Indigenous philosophy. Rooted in a
more non-hierarchical epistemology, such an Indigenous philosophy promises to
move us away from a colonized and deeply problematized way of thinking, toward
embracing the power and mysteriousness of presence, and making possible a
place-based, non-anthropocentric interconnectedness. This is the next essential
step we must take if we are to survive as a species.

While some readers of Speaking Being may be familiar with The Landmark Forum,
most don‚Äôt know its connections to the philosophical tradition. Hyde and Kopp
have woven together concise explanations of Heidegger‚Äôs notoriously diff icult
thinking with an actual transcript of Erhard‚Äôs Forum‚Äîby turns moving, funny, and
shocking. This juxtaposition draws the reader into the experience and powerfully
illuminates the teachings of these two thinkers.
DAVID STOREY, Associate Professor, Boston College, author of
Naturalizing Heidegger
Speaking Being presents an ontological play between Erhard, Heidegger, the
participants of a Forum delivered in 1989, and the reader, who is summoned to
the scene to dwell in compelling questions and distinctions, the living of which
make available the invention of a life that is experienced as authentic. The
relentless commitment of authors Hyde and Kopp to communicate the unsayable,
Being, opens up new directions for a rhetoric of emancipation that goes beyond
traditional critical theories. Speaking Being speaks a new relation to language, one
that honors the unexplored ontological power of language to create a new freedom
to be, to live with existential courage.
MARGARIDA GARCIA, Vice-Dean, Research and Communications, Faculty of Law
(Civil Law) and Professor, Faculty of Law (Civil Law) and Faculty of Social Sciences,
University of Ottawa
Many academics in cultural studies accept postmodernity and content pedagogy
as unquestionable facts of the world, but with a paltry understanding of how these
ideas undermine our intention to produce morally conscious, action-oriented
citizens. In their lucid exposition of Werner Erhard‚Äôs methodology, Hyde and Kopp
off er a cogent roadmap out of such a paralyzing paradigm of knowledge and
subjectivity. Brilliantly, the authors use Martin Heidegger‚Äôs writing to illuminate
Erhard‚Äôs work and The Forum‚Äôs compelling impact on participants. Readers will
discover for themselves, based on the contexts they bring, a powerful pedagogy
of transformation grounded in an ontological inquiry into human being that
leads students to discover their own paths of social agency and initiative. Highly
recommended!
TRYSTAN T. COTTEN, Associate Professor, Gender Studies, University of California,
Stanislaus, founder and managing editor of Transgress Press
Speaking Being presents, perhaps for the first time, a complete transcript of an
actual Forum led by Werner Erhard, allowing the reader to directly observe and
experience the unique power of dialogue as a tool for human transformation.
Furthermore, authors Hyde and Kopp provide an intellectually satisfying
correlation between the philosophical ideas of Martin Heidegger and the out-here-
in-the-world work of Werner Erhard, revealing their surprising complementarity. I
d
congratulate the authors on achieving this tour de force.
