SPEAKING BEING
every weekend, like you do, and I’m never not brought to my knees, like knocked out, by 
what happens for people in The Forum, or really what The Forum is for people. And these 
four days, sitting in this chair, in diff erent parts of the room, I saw that I had no idea what the 
possibility of this Forum was, at all, in being a participant. Who walked in here four days ago 
was, you know, “Yeah” to what life brings. But who’s walking out four days later is “Yes!” to 
life. I don’t care what life brings me, I’m a “yes” to that. To be grateful, to be thankful, to be 
blessed... I don’t know what the words are for that, but to be “yes,” to be able to be a “yes” to 
life, that is the greatest gift. Thank you.

Avril.
AVRIL
That’s what I wanted to talk about: choice.
KIPP
Good.
AVRIL
I defi nitely have my foot nailed to the fl oor in the area of choice. I’ve been trying to fi nd 
satisfaction in my marriage. I’ve kind of tried all kinds of things, hoping about it, creating it. I 
created it for about two weeks and that didn’t work. And about two years ago what I realized is 
that what I keep doing is trying to do all this stuff  on top of “no.” And so it’s like, “oh!...”
KIPP
The clearing that you are in life is “no.” That’s what you’re saying?
AVRIL
Yes. It’s like “no” has me. And all the other stuff  is on top of that. And so then I fi nally thought, 
“Okay, I got it. The choice is no!” So, I separated from my husband, and we’re both here to see 
what to do about our marriage. I’ve got all the reasons to get divorced and all the reasons why 
not to, and it seems like my choice is “no, I don’t want to be married.”
KIPP
These are two diff erent things. “My choice is no” and “I don’t want to be married” are distinct. 
One’s a decision and one’s a choice. 
AVRIL (weeping)
My choice is no, and I have this huge “should.”
KIPP
Yeah, that’s right.
