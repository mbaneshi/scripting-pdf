enough responsibility, and somebody’ll try to get close to me, and I’ll sit down. I’ll go on strike,
I’ll dare them to do whatever...
(breaking out into extended laughter)
A lot of people I’ve worked with—I’ve not allowed them to support me. I never realized that I
was just being my act about it. It never dawned on me that it was about being black and being
right. How it occurred for me is that they didn’t really care about me; that they were out for
their stuff . It wasn’t just who they are and who I am playing a game together. If I allowed in
what this work does for people; that would destroy my racket.
KIPP
And it would allow them to get the most out of you.
(laughter)
TRUMAN
Get the most out of me?
KIPP
Yeah. If this work gets the most out of people, it’ll get the most out of you.
TRUMAN (laughing)
Right, and I’m not interested in that.
(laughter)
I was sitting here. It was so funny. You were saying “Chocolate, choose.” And then it got funnier
when I was thinking “Chocolate chip, choose.”
(laughter)
KIPP
You all understand that all people are doing is sharing? All that’s happening is that people are
sharing. And you’re so excited; you’re peeing in your pants here. This is really more than you
ever bargained for in life. You never thought you could be a big enough person so that you could
hear people and let people this deeply into your lives. Thank you.
DARRELL
My whole act has been kind of being afraid of people, and then when I realized I got into the
conversation and saw that everybody is about as afraid of me as I am of them—that was a
bright light for me. I’ve been Mr. Aloof, sitting back like I know it all, and just wouldn’t talk to
anybody. I’ll just sit here looking like I’m in deep thought with myself and everyone will leave
me alone.

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
And you are in deep thought with yourself.
DARRELL
But what does it mean? It doesn’t mean anything.
KIPP
Right.
DARRELL
In these four days I’ve been talking about myself to people I don’t even know. It was useful. It
feels good. I feel that I don’t have to go around with this act. I don’t have to keep myself separate
because I’m afraid people will fi nd out who I really am. I’m happy with that. Thank you!
(applause)
KIPP
Well done. Thank you!
HARRIET
I’m feeling tremendous energy that it is to choose to take the microphone and to be willing to
engage in the conversation, and not know anything about being right, and what the in-order-to
is. Just feeling the energy of the danger and the danger of the energy be used by power and all
that. Now I feel stupid.
KIPP
Now you’re just here.
HARRIET
I’m just here. And I’ve been afraid to engage in conversation, wanting to be right in the
conversation, wanting to be reasonable, wanting to wait for just the right moment to share the
right thing.
KIPP
It’s a very big one, that business of waiting for the right moment, the right thing, the right way
to do it, that’s a killer.
HARRIET
It has a lot to do with signifi cance. I have to make everything extremely signifi cant and
extremely important.
KIPP
Everything has to be extremely signifi cant and extremely important?
Forum Day Four: Session Three 467
HARRIET
Yeah. Really carrying it to absurd degrees.
KIPP
Like what?
HARRIET
For example, Thursday, I parked my car, got out of my car: I stepped in shit, literal shit.
(laughter)
“What does this mean?” And I started thinking that I wasn’t in harmony with the universe, or I
wouldn’t have stepped in shit. So I wipe it off .
KIPP (to laughter)
That is so great! You step in shit: You’re out of harmony with the universe...
HARRIET
Ah, but wait! But then yesterday when Werner was talking about stepping in dogshit I thought,
“Wow! I’m really doing it right.”
KIPP (to laughter)
Wow! You’re on the leading edge of shit! Nothing could ever just happen!
HARRIET (laughing)
That’s my life!
KIPP
Stepping in shit and having it be in harmony with the universe. Anything else Harriet?
HARRIET
I choose whatever is in front of me.
KIPP (to laughter)
Or underneath you.
HARRIET
Yup! And I’m still making it real signifi cant.
KIPP
That’s right. It all can be signifi cant as hell.
HARRIET
Right. Yeah.

KIPP
Well done. Thank you very much!
KAREN
On my way down from Washington to do The Forum, the bus driver had heard of this work
and he suggested to me that it was brainwashing and I shouldn’t do it. The fi rst day, I had that
thought just a bit. I mean, brainwashing does happen.
KIPP
Yes. Rub a dub dub.
(laughter)
KAREN (becoming moved as she speaks)
Then I listened to the sharing, and I saw that if the work can call forth this kind of authenticity,
and recognize that authenticity, then it’s got to be authentic. And it’s got to all be authentic. All
of it. I want all of you who have stood up to share to get that it’s been such a huge contribution
to see people having that kind of courage and willingness to step out and it really is profoundly
moving to see people come up against pain and grief and fear and push through when they
never thought they could, it’s extraordinary, and people are magnifi cent. I came to America to
have adventures, and love and joy were not two things that were especially present in my life
before coming here, and that’s what I got here.
KIPP
Thank you.
(applause)
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 13)
I’ve been participating in this work since 1975—that’s about half my life—and this is the greatest
thing I ever did... the fi rst minute I was in the original program I knew I’d never seen anything
like this, and I knew I’d be around this for a long, long time, and through the fourteen or fi fteen
years that I’ve been participating, I’ve seen a lot of people get to that kind of moment where they
lost touch with life or, sometimes we call it an incident, I’ve seen probably a hundred thousand
people get to what it was for them, and I’ve never ever had a sense of what mine was, until today. I
fi gured there was something wrong with me, after fourteen years you’d fi gure it would pass by, but
it never came up, and I’d like to share it if I could. When people stand up and share about having
a horrible childhood, and having these terrible things happen to them, I didn’t have anything like
that. I had the greatest childhood in the world, the greatest parents, they told me they loved me all
the time, they sent me to the best schools. When I was about four years old, I was in the fi rst grade
because I could read and write, I was a really smart little kid, and I got great grades, I got on the
honor roll all the time, and I got merit badges and merit pins, and awards, and I didn’t even know
half the time what they were giving them to me for. It wasn’t like I was working hard, or like I

did anything, I just went to school and I loved God and I did what my parents told me to do, and
it worked. It was kind of like that for a few years. I remember starting third grade, and the fi rst
day—and I always sat in the front row, I loved to participate—the teacher kept asking all these
questions and I kept raising my hand, participating and answering the questions and was giving
all the right answers, and the teacher said “You are going to be my best student.” She went on
and asked another question, and I gave my answer and I got it wrong. And she looked at me and
said “That was really stupid.” And that was it! That was it! I just said “Okay! Fine! We’ll do it your
way” and it’s been that way ever since. And the funny thing is, I really got that’s defi nitely the
point at which I started to withdraw. It started to become about me. Up to that point there wasn’t
me, there was just participating and I felt like life was a privilege all the time...
KIPP
There’s something in there, a bit clouded. You might not have seen it. Up until that point there
was just participation. Not me. When you’re really participating, you’re not even there. You
know, when you’re really dancing, or really cooking, or really involved in something in life that
you love—that’s happening, not you.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 13)
So when she said “You’re going to be my best student,” or whatever the hell she said to me, well
I had never thought about that, I never thought that there was a best or a worst or anything like
that. I started thinking, “Well, I’m going to be the best!” And the next stupid thing out of my
mouth was the exact wrong thing to say, and I decided that...
KIPP
The next stupid thing out of your mouth was the next thing out of your mouth.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 13, laughing)
I don’t even remember what it was, and when I got in touch with it today, I was like, “ahh yeah!
I fi nally got my incident!” And it made absolutely no diff erence to know what it was. None!
KIPP (to applause)
Thank you very much. You know, there’s a story in science called evolution. In that story,
sometime, a long time ago, there was a little bit of something that became life in the water. It
started to evolve over eons of time. And then in a moment, a fi sh walked out of the water onto
land. That’s no longer evolution. It’s the evolution of evolution. That’s transformation. What
the past four days have been about was providing you a clearing to walk out on the land. And
the truth is you are not equipped for the land. What the seminars are about is equipping you to
create a new possibility of growth and learning and extraordinary results on the land. And if
you apply the rules of the water to see if you’re going to be in a seminar or not, they’re not going
to work. I invite you to choose to be in a seminar. Don’t concern yourself with which seminar
to be in. If the seminar reserved for you works, do that. If that night doesn’t work, pick another
one. Some of you are saying, fi rst I’ve got to digest The Forum. I invite you to consider what
you digest turns into. You are invited to participate. And you have the right to decline... ...When
