Forum Day Four: Session One
347
ERHARD
It’s all clear now, isn’t it? It’s all clear now. Absolutely. That cleared it all up, now didn’t it? Go
on Wes.
(after much laughter, Wes continues to read several defi nitions of “life”)
It’s all clear now isn’t it?
DENNIS
No it’s not...
ERHARD
Listen up. You’ve got a hidden standard for getting it. Did you hear what I said? You’ve got a
hidden standard for getting it. It’s kind of like, when I hear the angels trumpet then I’ll know
I got it. So you want to get that standard up on the mat in order to be able to get it. What’s the
standard? How are you going to know when you got it?
DENNIS
I guess when I hear my bells ring.
KIPP
He wants the bells. We’ll give him the bells.
ERHARD
Listen, now. This is it.
KIPP
We’re going to demonstrate something so that every time you give signifi cance to your life, you
can see what life really means.
Kipp opened a dictionary and balanced it on his head. Then he held a chalkboard eraser in each
hand and walked around the room through the group, very solemnly clapping the two erasers to-
gether and dispensing eraser dust like the incense in a church processional. He approached Dennis
and clapped the erasers directly in front of him, as if dispensing a blessing. The room broke out into
extended applause and laughter.
ERHARD (to the group)
You understand he was illustrating you all; you’re just covert about it. That’s what you look like
when you stand in the truth. Is that silly enough? Think you’ll remember that? When you’re
pontifi cating, you want to remember that’s what you look like.
(to Dennis)
See: You’re wanting to make some signifi cance out of getting it.

SPEAKING BEING
DENNIS
That’s correct.
ERHARD
And getting it is to get that there is no signifi cance. So there can’t be any signifi cance in getting
it. You want to know where you’ve got your foot nailed to the fl oor? When you were younger
somebody told you some bullshit about what it was to get it. What were you told when you were
young about what it was to be enlightened, to get it?
DENNIS
I was brought up believing that one should be successful and make things happen for yourself,
to be in control.
ERHARD
Yeah, and you know that was the product of the culture in which you were brought up, and
family in which you were brought up, and the time of history in which you were brought up.
And you know, there are cultures in which success is looked down upon, in which you have to
hide your success. You know that, right?
DENNIS
Sure.
ERHARD
Sure. So what’s the signifi cance of that? I mean, which is right? Which is the right way to
go? Is the right way to go and devote your life to success, or to devote your life to something
else? Which is the right way to go? Do you see that the question is insane? You go the way you
go. The question whether it is right or wrong is irrelevant, stupid, is stupefying. Look at how
stupid it made you. That was not an insult. It was just a report. Look at the stupidity that you’ve
revealed in your own lives. You know, the “at the heart of it” stupidity. Yeah there’s nothing
wrong with being oriented around and regarding being successful or accomplishment highly.
DENNIS
Yeah but, I feel like... I don’t consider myself overly successful, but somewhat successful, like
you said...
ERHARD
Here’s how successful you are. I’ve seen your bank account: You’re as successful as you are.
That’s how successful you are and it’ll probably remain like that. No matter how much you
accomplish, you will only be as successful as you are, and you will not be as successful as you
aren’t. And that’s the way it’s going to be for the rest of your life. Right? It’s like “who’s buried
in Grant’s tomb?”
