Forum Day Three: Session Three 245
ERHARD
You play the game right you’ll end up with a mountain of answers. Yes. I had a mountain of
answers. I had a trailer behind the car. I had answers from the best places.
JACOB
Yeah, but they weren’t the answers. It seems like there should only be one.
ERHARD
Yeah there is one. I already gave it to you. There is no answer. See, you want to build a pile of
answers and fi nd out one day that it’s a pile of shit and not a pile of answers?
JACOB
It sounds like you have all these answers that you’ve rendered meaningless.
ERHARD
They were the answers. I stood on top of that pile of answers, fi nely honed, hard earned, and
recognized that the answer was: there is no answer.
JACOB
It sounds like what you’re saying is that you read a book one day, maybe Freud, and that’s what
happened, but you kept it and made it mean something out of it.
ERHARD
Not something out of it, I made the answer out of it, and I had a mountain of answers. And
look, I could do you real easy. “I could look at it this way and that way, and there’s no one real
way to look at it—the way to look at it—there are many ways to look at it.” This week, this
year, this era of your life: the answer. Not “the answer is that there isn’t any answer, there are
many answers.” That’s an answer. You get that that’s an answer?
JACOB
Yeah.
ERHARD
Yeah, but if you’ve got an answer, then that isn’t the answer: The answer is there isn’t any
answer. And if you turn that into an answer, that isn’t it either.
JACOB
That’s a vicious circle.
ERHARD
That’s right. This whole thing is a vicious circle. And the only way to get to break the vicious
circle is that there isn’t any answer, and that life isn’t going to turn out, it isn’t going to work
out, and someday isn’t going to turn out so that you can play your aces.
Heidegger on Thinking the Same
Every thinker thinks one only thought. Here,
too, thinking diff ers essentially from science.
The researcher needs constantly new discov-
eries and inspirations, else science will bog
down and fall into error. The thinker needs one
thought only. And for the thinker the diff iculty
is to hold fast to this one only thought as the
one and only thing that he must think; to think
this One as the Same; and to tell of this Same
in a fitting manner. But we speak of the Same
in the manner that befits it only if we always
say the same about it, in such a way that we
ourselves are claimed by the Self-same. The
limitlessness of the Same is the sharpest limit set
to thinking. (WCT 50, emphasis added)
“
It is a job of The Forum leader to see that the conversation of The
Forum always speaks the Same. ■

SPEAKING BEING
JACOB
When you say “it,” I get that you mean life, but something is going to work out.
ERHARD
Really?
JACOB
Yeah.
ERHARD
Are you the Pope?
JACOB
I anticipate that something’s going to happen.
ERHARD
Yeah and evil spirits are going to come down and invade people’s bodies and make them sick.
JACOB
And I’ll go home and not get enough sleep to come back here tomorrow.
ERHARD
And you know what? You will if you do and you won’t if you don’t. And your anticipation is
meaningless because it’s going to be just the way it is.
JACOB
Yeah, anticipation means that there’s going to be a stupid story attached to what happened.
ERHARD
Sure. And you’re going to anticipate anyhow. See, it’s a perfect trap, Jacob. That’s the thing
Californians don’t understand. The attempt to get out of the trap constricts the bars of the
prison. The attempt to get beyond the “this-is-all-there-is” keeps you in the trap. Trying to get
out of the prison keeps you in the prison. And not trying to get out of the prison keeps you in
the prison. Everybody’s got a form of making it. Even not making it for some people is a form of
making it. Either way is an attempt to get out of the trap and that keeps you in the trap. There is
no outside the prison. Outside the prison is inside the prison.
JACOB
It’s the spot you are in.
ERHARD
Yes. You’re only going to be in the spot you’re in.
The attempt to get beyond the “this-is-all-
there-is” keeps you in the trap. Trying to get
out of the prison keeps you in the prison. And
not trying to get out of the prison keeps you in
the prison.

Forum Day Three: Session Three 247
JACOB
So is that the perfect spot?
ERHARD
No. That’s adding meaning to it. That’s a Jacobism, that last one. That’s the best one you did
because you can see it in that one. See, you’re trying to make it all right! That’s what it means to
turn it into a philosophy. You’re doing a “fi reside talk.” It’s a trap. But it’s all right that it’s a trap.
JACOB
That’s what I’m saying.
ERHARD
But that’s what ruins it. It’s not all right. It’s not not all right either. It’s just like this.
JACOB
Okay.
ERHARD
You got it. Well done, thank you.
(applause)
KIPP
Patsy, you win the prize, and a large bicep. Holding your hand up for forty minutes straight.
PATSY
Aerobics!
KIPP
Exactly.
PATSY
It’s taken me three days to get up and talk, and I love to talk...
KIPP
When should you have gotten up to talk?
PATSY
I said something the fi rst day...
KIPP
You said it took you three days to get up.
248
SPEAKING BEING
PATSY
Now it’s perfect that I’m up talking.
ERHARD
Certainly, if you’d gotten up earlier it would have been bad, right?
PATSY
No it would have been perfect at the time.
ERHARD
Because whatever happens is perfect, right?
PATSY
Absolutely.
ERHARD (speaking with dramatic forcefulness)
Wrong! Whatever happens is not perfect! That’s fucking California crap! Whatever happens is
whatever happens! You fucking Californians: you’re disgusting! Goddamned platitudes.
(calmly)
At any rate: you’re up.
PATSY
I really got what you said about the aces, I really got it, and as I listened to it and watched the
demonstration, all of a sudden a confl ict appeared. And that is: how many times do you throw
your aces out and you get stepped on, kicked, shit on, and you say okay, and then do it again,
and again, and the result that you wanted doesn’t happen.
KIPP
What knocked you over is the last thing you said. “The result that you wanted doesn’t happen.”
Because what always happens?
PATSY
What happens.
KIPP
So when you throw your aces out, you throw your aces out. And you don’t when you don’t.
PATSY
Right, but given that you are human...
KIPP
If you are...
Forum Day Three: Session Three 249
PATSY
Sometimes, but when you keep throwing those aces out to the same person for fi fteen years,
for instance...
KIPP
Okay, roll ’em. Bring out the props. Okay...
PATSY
Angel’s my roommate!
The room broke out into prolonged laughter as Kipp made a sweeping motion as if operating a
giant projector.
KIPP
Okay! Roll ’em and weep!
PATSY
I keep doing it and there comes a point where I want to make a choice that I don’t want that
anymore.
WES
It’s not a choice, by the way. If we ever get this across—which is not looking good at this
point—we’ll get to choice.
Wes imitated various possible internal dialogues participants might be having at this point in the
proceedings, including, “Well, what about that multiple orgasm I had that time? Was that empty
and meaningless?”
WES
That’s what you sound like... an internal dialogue machine. The way to blow the circuits on
that is actually getting for yourself that this is empty and meaningless, and this is it.
PATSY
It sounds real simple.
WES
Too simple for complicated minds. You want to see what the complication of your life is, and
the story, and the drama. And this concern you have for giving away your crummy aces. Like
you don’t get it. It’s the giving of yourself away in which life occurs. All the rest is a drama.
It’s all made up. It’s absurd. You’re absurd. But that’s okay, because they’re still going to throw
dirt in your face whether you’re absurd or not. Do you think in a hundred years people will be
discussing your relationships?
PATSY
No.
