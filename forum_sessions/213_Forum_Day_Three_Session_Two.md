Forum Day Three: Session Two

her. There was nothing else to do. But then I realized that there was something incomplete,
which was how I was in the relationship, but not how I presented myself in the relationship.
I saw what a shit I was when I was a teenager, and how much damage I had done by leaving.
I left home after college and I emigrated to this country alone. I made it on my own. I never
completed that I ran away.
WES
She’s talking about running away as a solution to a problem. Probably useful for you to look
at the things you have left, the people you have left in order to solve a problem. To get the
communication you left from their perspective.
JOYCE
Yesterday I saw the damage I had done. I see that I participate, but I don’t share. I’m very good
at what I do, but I don’t put myself in there. And I knew that I had to give that up here in The
Forum. I called my mother. I told her. She said “that’s great!” I told her about two incidents that
were very troubling. I told her that I got how rotten I was in the process of leaving. She said,
“yes you were.”
WES
And right there was the moment of getting off  it.
JOYCE
She said, “thank you for telling me that.” She described how I was and it was frightening. I can
see what it must have been like for her. I saw what I am like; I can see what a pain in the ass I
am for all the people I work with. I have heard it but haven’t really seen it. It was very settling.
WES
There’s a possibility for being in communication that settles issues.
JOYCE
She told me “hearing this gives me a wave of warmth.” I got that I set her free and that I was
too.
WES
Great. Thank you.
(applause)
I invite you to listen to big people, people willing to set aside their accomplishments, to not use
them as an excuse to not participate, as a way for you to put yourself into The Forum.
Jake stood—the participant from Day One who was “hustle waiting to happen” and who also was
“nutty” about inauthenticity.

SPEAKING BEING
JAKE
I was a shit to my mom when I was nine years old. Our relationship has been the same, and so I
apologized to her. I told her I was here and she thought that was neat. She was glad to hear that.
I said “let’s not be this anymore.” I told her that I accept her. She drives me nuts, but I want a
relationship with her.
WES
She doesn’t drive you nuts. You can have an interpretation that your mother drives you nuts.
I know that one very well. When I was thirty-fi ve I visited my mother in Miami and she told
me what time she thought I should be home. Drove me nuts. If it was raining out, she would
suggest clothes to wear. Drove me nuts: until I got off  it and got how much of a creep I was. I
got off  it and I allowed my mother to mother me. Because that’s what mothers do. That’s their
job. What did you expect your mother to do? Business deals with you?
JAKE
I’ve got a complex network of anxiety of reactionary being. When I’m that way it destroys what
we can’t have between each other. We don’t have a connection. I told her I loved her and she
said something to me. I realized she knew more of what’s going on than I thought. She said that
she would give me the space to be me. She knows how crazy she is. And she said she was going
to stop doing that with me.
WES (to another participant taking a microphone)
This is about completing with your parents?
ESME
My twin sister. I saw how I make her wrong. I told her that I loved her, that I had taken things
out on her instead of “you,” which I mean everyone.
WES
There’s a lot more love going on around you than most people are willing to experience.
ESME
I completed with my sister about our competition for our dead father’s love. But I still was
having an issue with “you” when I overheard a bunch of people asking a woman from Uganda
really stupid questions. I realized she wasn’t upset about stupid questions, and that I don’t have
to be. I can be an expert about being a twin.
WES
We’ve got to move on. But you have a standing invitation to keep getting complete with people
in your life. One of the commitments of The Forum is to unconceal the being of human
beings—what’s giving you who you are. What was there before you were born? If you’re a man
or a woman, you were born into what it is to be one. If you’re trying to carve out a new version,
you’re doing it against that already always background. The being of human being was decided
at a party you weren’t invited to and you had to fi t into that once you showed up. One of the
Danger: Attunements and Moods
In Heidegger’s account of human existence, Dasein—human
being—is always being some way. Being-in-the-world, that is, is
always a particular way of being. Heidegger uses two terms for
this condition—Befindlichkeit, which is translated as state-of-mind
(Dreyfus translates this as aff ectedness), and Bestimmung, translated
as attunement. Both terms will be found in passages quoted in this
book, but we will focus on the latter term, “attunement,” since it
avoids psychological implications embedded in “state-of-mind,”
and more powerfully suggests the totality of the situation: I am
always attuned to the world in some way, and my attunement at
any moment determines what things in the world mean to me—how
much and in what way they “matter.”
But my options for ways of being attuned to the world have
been made available to me in my thrownness—that is, they are
limited to a certain range of opportunities for understanding, a
context of meaning into which I have been thrown, willy-nilly,
and over which I have no control (see the “Thrownness” sidebar
in Session Three of Day Two). The nature and source of these
limits are invisible to me; like water to a fish, this background is
so enveloping, so constitutive of everything, that I cannot see it. I
simply experience its strictures in my life, and, occasionally, have
the vague sense that there might be something more. In another of
Erhard’s expressions, my thrownness lies in the realm of what we
don’t know that we don’t know, and is therefore beyond our grasp.
But it colors everything.
Further, there is something primordially threatening about the
nature of this context, a danger that leads us to avoid confronting
it (though we don’t know that this is what we are doing),
despite our sense that more might be possible in life. Dasein,
at some level, recognizes that it does not want to face up to the
inescapability of its limits—what Heidegger calls “the facticity of
its being delivered over” (BT 174). To avoid this confrontation, we
lose ourselves in the distractions of the they-self—averageness,
curiosity, ambiguity, and the chatter of the public realm. In certain
states of mind, a situation may occur for us with a heightened
intensity, but its nature remains obscured: an attunement is the
kind of Being in which
