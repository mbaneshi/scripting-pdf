Forum Day Three: Session One

KIPP (to the group)
I’m inviting you to keep being present to sharing.
XAVIER
I called my girlfriend. I think I’m getting things. I kid myself about getting things, and I don’t
know shit.
KIPP
Yeah. What do you do in life?
XAVIER
I’m a student.
KIPP
Of course, you have to be a student if you don’t know shit... Somebody that doesn’t know shit
has to be a student—because you can’t be present to “I don’t know.” If you can get that you’re
reporting when you’re reporting—that’s worth the four days... “I was talking about rackets” is
reporting. “I said I was full of shit” is sharing. And what did your girlfriend say?
XAVIER
That I was just reporting on things.
KIPP
Listen. That’s worth his four days. If you can get that you’re reporting when you’re reporting,
it’s worth the four days. And?
XAVIER
I said that I am full of shit; I am running rackets all the time.
KIPP
She said?
XAVIER
She shared about how uncomfortable it is to be called on her rackets. It’s embarrassing.
KIPP
Being alive is embarrassing. If you don’t want to be embarrassed, stay dead.
ERHARD
It’s embarrassing to be yourself. Ask any teenager, he’ll tell you. That’s why teenagers put an
act together. It’s innately embarrassing to be yourself. That’s how you get to be an adult when
you’re a teenager. You learn not to be yourself. It’s true about everybody in the room. You want
to get that. It’s embarrassing to be yourself.

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
You start participating in your own life, it’s going to be awkward and embarrassing for you. It
took about three years to train me. I was too embarrassed to be with people.
(prompting Xavier to keep sharing rather than describing)
And you said? And she said?
XAVIER
We broke up on Tuesday.
KIPP
Good. Always break up before The Forum. You might get lucky in here.
(laughter)
Careful. You’re having fun. It might be a shock to your system.
(laughter)
XAVIER
I’m sitting here during The Forum having these thoughts.
KIPP
No, the thoughts are having you. And the thoughts say?
XAVIER
I’m a worthless piece of shit.
Kipp crossed the platform to the table, picked up a box of tissues, and used the tissues to demonstrate
Xavier’s “thoughts” that he was “identifying with,” and “being owned by.” Kipp did this by pulling
a tissue from the box, wafting it through the air, and inserting it into one of his nostrils, and then
another in the other nostril, to much laughter.
KIPP (with tissues in his nostrils, regarding Xavier)
And you go?
XAVIER
I’ll never amount to anything.
KIPP (fi lling both ears with tissues; laughter)
And the next thought?
XAVIER
It’s hopeless.
