Forum Day Four: Session Three 491
ERHARD
There’s the fi nished paper. Whatever he or she is typing from and the fi nished paper. The rest
of it is transparent. There’s no typewriter. If you’re working on a typewriter, you’re not working
fast. You’ve got to produce paper with type on it.
BECKY
I understand all that. I’m going to be very stupid. I am very stupid here.
ERHARD
You’re being very smart. It would be stupid to sit down when you’re not getting something.
BECKY
I have not stood up many times in this Forum when I’ve not understood something.
ERHARD
Don’t editorialize anymore. This is the fourth day.
BECKY
Okay. I don’t get: “I’m in a racing car. I’m going a hundred miles an hour...”
ERHARD
But a hundred miles an hour is an is speed, read off  of a dial. It’s not an occurring speed. See, I
went fast when a hundred miles an hour was slow. I went slow when a hundred miles an hour
was fast.
BECKY
Well what shifted it for you?
ERHARD
You’re into the next question. The next question is going to be “What access do I have to the
occurring?” We’re not up to that question yet.
BECKY
But you’re talking about the end result of the shift without telling me...
ERHARD
Yes that’s right, it’s horrible, isn’t it?
BECKY (laughing)
Yes, I’m frustrated.
ERHARD
I understand. That’s because I want you to have a question. The question I want you to have is:
“How do you gain access to the occurring? I want to alter my behavior. I know I can’t alter my
492
SPEAKING BEING
behavior by telling myself to alter my behavior. I now see I can alter my behavior by altering the
way the world occurs for me. How do I gain access to the occurring?”
BECKY
Got it. Thanks.
ERHARD (to the last standing participant)
This better be really fucking original.
(laughter)
MIKE (the participant who had the “stupid” racket)
I don’t understand. You threw a ball over there, with the gentleman standing over here. He can’t
catch it.
ERHARD
No. You say he can’t catch it. There are athletes who could catch that ball. If that was an ape,
the ape would have caught it. The ball is catchable, but the ball occurs as uncatchable. How
close does the ball have to be to you to be catchable?
MIKE
It depends on how fast the ball is coming...
ERHARD
At a given speed, how close does it have to be?
MIKE
A ball at a given speed?
ERHARD
Yeah, how close does it have to be to be catchable?
MIKE
I have to be able to run to it in time in order to be able to catch it.
ERHARD
And that depends on how fast the ball is moving.
MIKE
Correct.
ERHARD
Very good. And how fast the ball is moving is not determined by a radar gun. It’s determined by
the speed the ball occurs for you. Guys who play baseball for a living, play baseball with big, fat,
Techne
To develop the perspective on technology and the danger posed
by the technological understanding of Being, Heidegger turns,
as he oft en does, to etymology in order to explore the historical
meanings deeply embedded in our language. “In the word,
in language, things first come to be and are,” he says (IM 15).
Therefore the way the world occurs for us today can be traced to
the way it was originally understood and put into language by the
first Western thinkers, the pre-Socratics, who lived at a time when
the increasing complexity of phenomena emerging from the flux
required the development of a deeper understanding of things.
In their response to this challenge, so Heidegger’s account
runs, the Greeks unavoidably set a direction for Western thinking;
and from that meaningful beginning, the “play of Being”—the
evolution of human thinking and thus of human Being—can
be traced through history, culminating in our current view of
ourselves and our world. “What is Greek,” says Heidegger, “is the
dawn of that destiny in which Being illuminates itself in beings,
and so propounds a certain essence of man; that essence unfolds
as something fateful . . .” (EGT 25).
A central artifact in this archaeology of language is the Greek
word techne. Heidegger notes that “the Greeks, who knew quite a
bit about works of art, use the same word techne for craft  and art
and call the craft sman and the artist by the same name: technites”
(PLT 59). Over time, techne came to mean the activities of the
craft sman, primarily the work of making things; so its subsequent
evolution as a term for the functioning of technical instruments is
not surprising. But Heidegger asserts that this meaning is “oblique
and superficial,” and that the word techne “never means a kind of
practical performance. The word techne denotes rather a mode of
knowing” (PLT 59).
But it is knowing in a unique mode: techne is knowing that
creates what is known. It reveals things by bringing them forth for
the first time, a stage in the creative process that precedes the
act of making. When a house or a ship is to be built, it is revealed
before it is produced:
