Forum Day One: Session One 
31
After Erhard left the room, Julie requested that due to the size of the group all participants should
be respectful of the hotel. She pointed out the assistants who could direct participants to pay phones
and bathrooms. “We request that you don’t eat on this break,” she said. “If you must eat for medical
reasons, please see Wes,” one of the two Forum leaders who were assisting Erhard. Finally she in-
troduced the other four Forum supervisors who were working with her, and who were available to
answer their questions. Finally, as she would before every break, she read the names of participants
who had received telephone messages during the session.
The Forum adjourned for a break at 12:40 pm.
