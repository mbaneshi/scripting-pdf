SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
You are truly a heavy guy, aren’t you?
KENNETH
Yes. And I’ve lost a lot of vitality in the last...
There was laughter from the participants, because the absence of vitality was so apparent.
KIPP
You’re also a master of understatement.
KENNETH  (laughing)
And to have a certain façade that really I thought worked.
KIPP
And you have to keep that whole heavy and signifi cant thing in place!
KENNETH
Right. And then to fi nd out it doesn’t mean shit.
KIPP
Right.
KENNETH
Wooo!
KIPP
What it means is being heavy and signifi cant, and whatever else you say, that’s what it means.
KENNETH
Just before dinner last night I got light.
KIPP
Yeah, and it scared the shit out of you. You see it’s risky. See, what you already are is familiar.
Being scared, sad, upset. That’s what you call “you.” Anything else is unfamiliar. Unfamiliar is
awkward, embarrassing, so you’ll take anything that’s familiar, even if it’s destroying your life.
KENNETH
Yeah, at dinnertime I felt great, like maybe I could get off  this schtick. I had a real sense there
of lightness and then I got heavy.

KIPP
And that’s the way it’s going to be for you. How many of you have noticed things opening up
and closing, opening up and closing, opening up and closing, opening up and closing?
(many hands go up)
Put your hands down. Now, how many of you would like it to stay open forever?
(many hands go up)
And that’s what makes you stupid.
KENNETH
Whooo!
KIPP  (loudly)
Because as soon as it opens up you make opening up mean something. That’s the way life
should be now!
KENNETH
Yeah, that’s what I did.
KIPP
Yeah, you want an event. You don’t want to live; you want an event.
KENNETH
Yeah. I want a drama around the event.
KIPP
And so you’ll have drama around the event. Everybody wants an event, an easy answer, so they
don’t ever have to inquire again, or think again... Did you share with people?
KENNETH
Yeah.
KIPP
What happened? Who did you share with?
KENNETH
I shared with several people.
KIPP
What did you share? “I said...”
330
SPEAKING BEING
KENNETH
I shared about losing my job, about poor Kenneth, about why I feel there’s a poor Kenneth
there. I got relatively clear on that during the training why I have a poor Kenneth thing, what
that’s doing to my life. I didn’t get to the tears that I’ve been experiencing here. That’s new.
I didn’t have that in the training. I feel like my life the past two years has been going upside
down and it’s scaring the shit out of me.
KIPP
No, what happened is, you got laid off , and your marriage is...
KENNETH
My marriage is about to terminate.
KIPP
It’s about to terminate. You sound like it’s a computer turning off .
(laughter)
KENNETH
Really. Okay.
KIPP
And something about your house.
KENNETH
Right.
KIPP
Anything else?
KENNETH
I have a new relationship.
KIPP
Are you always this excited about that or is this a breakthrough?
(laughter)
KENNETH
That’s great, yeah. Pardon my schtick.

KIPP
You understand that enthusiasm is a threat to your survival? Joy is a threat to your survival?
Self-expression is a threat to your survival? I’m not saying any of those are good, or the way
you should be, and the way you are isn’t the way you should be. I’m not saying that; it’s easy to
hear that. I’m just saying that you’re locked out of most of life. One’s not better than the other.
But right now you have no choice.
KENNETH
It would be nice to have a choice.
KIPP
It would give you freedom to have a choice.
KENNETH
Yeah, which is what I felt for a little bit last night.
KIPP
Yeah, and rigorously speaking, it wasn’t a feeling.
KENNETH
That’s what I saw last night.
KIPP
Yeah. Your feelings are a product of your racket, or the context of whatever you give your feelings to
occur in. So far your feelings have had the space of your racket.
KENNETH
Yes.
KIPP
Anything else?
KENNETH
Thank you.
(applause as Kenneth sat)
KIPP
Well done!
SARAH
Where do I start? Let me fi nd a place... I got my racket, and saw, last night, the terror of it.
332
SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
Of what?
SARAH
My racket is “I’m an incompetent parent.” And as the people I had dinner with me last night
would tell you, you get anywhere close to that and like, it’s survival, this is war. It’s like, you
know...
KIPP
What are you talking about? What’s war? What’s survival?
SARAH
It’s like I... my racket is “I’m an incompetent parent.”
KIPP
You’re an incompetent parent.
SARAH
Right.
KIPP
And if somebody says...
SARAH
And if somebody even gets even pretty close to that...
KIPP
And questions you as a parent?
SARAH
They don’t even have to get that close. You know...
KIPP
Okay.
SARAH
So, last night, um, I was looking at some other always...already always beings, and I saw them
as, you know, there was no meaning there for them. I looked at my past. I’m from the South,
and I looked at some of these southern things we have; and I really got it: You can jump into
that game, or you don’t, you know, it’s there. And I looked at my “I’m an incompetent par-
ent” and the terror, and I really felt the terror, and I couldn’t get to no meaning, to empty and
meaningless. I couldn’t get it; I had that terror all night long. And I understood the person who
stood up and said “when I was a little kid I was embarrassed, and I’m never embarrassed.” He’s
The Call of Conscience
As we have shown, for both Martin Heidegger and Werner Erhard,
the current experience of human being is fundamentally missing
something. Heidegger located the source of this absence in the
assumptions of the metaphysical tradition, whose understanding
of the world does not include the background realm that he calls
Being. At this point in development of that tradition, that anything
is missing has also been forgotten; and beyond the next forgotten-
ness is oblivion (see the last sidebar of Session Three of Day
Four). “Being,” says Heidegger, “is still waiting for the time when
it will become thought-provoking to man” (“LH” in BW 227). Thus
W
a central task of The Forum is to make present this deficiency in
such a way that it transforms into a new possibility for Being.
However, human beings, when listening away to the “they”
self, avoid confronting any deficiency by embracing distraction,
losing themselves in the ways of the world into which they have
been thrown. The Self of Dasein, remember, is a way of existing,
and the way we exist is to fall into the arms of the possibilities we
find open to us—the arms of the “they,” a world of curiosity, idle
chatter, and ambiguity, which constitute the groundless public
discourse that is always right, and for whom nothing is new. But
in thus falling, we remain lost, wherein “Dasein makes no choices,
gets carried along by the nobody [the “they” self, or as Erhard
sometimes calls it, the “anybody” self] and thus ensnares itself in

got, maybe, the terror there. And the terror was there. I couldn’t get out of it. I have a beautiful
concept of it. And I can tell you metaphors about it, but it was there. I got up this morning, and
it’s like... my son came in and he sits down on the bed. He said “Mom, tell me about this thing
you’re doing.” Before I tell you that, let me tell you a little bit about my son. He spent fi ve years
in a mental hospital. He’s thirteen now. And I said “Well, we’re talking about how we are as
human beings. And we’ve been talking about how we have these things that exist for us from
when we were really little, and he said “You mean those things we know from the time we
were born?” Shit.
(laughter)
So I say “Yeah.” So anyway, and we go on and we’re talking, and he’s following me, and I say
“Yeah, I’ve been looking at the way I am, and this thing I’ve got about being an incompetent
parent, and the terror I have with it. And he says, “Mom, you’re an incompetent parent,” and
then he laughed—
(she demonstrates the laughter)
“Mom, we’re related!”
(applause)
And I’m blown away, laughing and crying at the same time, really, and he’s standing there and
says “Mom, I don’t understand you’re laughing and crying, but don’t look, I’m crying.” It was
like... Later on in the morning he was sitting on the bed and terrorizing the cat. So I says “now
what would you do if somebody came in and was terrorizing the cat the way you’re terrorizing
the cat?” “Well I would shoot ’em.” And I said, “I just don’t know what to do about it.” And he
says “well you’re an incompetent parent!”
(laughter)
I said “I got it. If I were terrorizing the cat, what would you do?” And he said “I’d tell you to
stop it.” And I said “Well, stop terrorizing the cat.” And he did.
KIPP
A lot of work.
SARAH
Yeah.
KIPP
It’s been this drama. And this tragedy, and how to work it out, and what to do...
SARAH
“How do I do it to you to make you stop terrorizing the cat?”
KIPP
Yeah, building a strategy and looking for the options.
inauthenticity” (BT 312). Such a life may be easy, interesting, and
T
pleasant; but it is never one’s own.
And yet: since this is the only mode of existence we have
experienced, how could we know that any other mode is
available? What is needed is a hint, a prod, a direction: “In terms
of its possibility,” says Heidegger, “Dasein
y
is already a potentiality-
for-Being-its-Self, but it needs to have this possibility attested”
(BT 313, emphasis added). For this purpose, we are introduced
T
here to an old friend whom we have undoubtedly encountered
before:
[Because] Dasein is lost in the “they,” it must
first find itself. In order to find itself at all,
it must be ‘shown’ to itself in its possible
authenticity. . . .this potentiality [-for-Being-
its-Self] is attested by that which, in Dasein’s
everyday interpretation of itself, is familiar
to us as the “voice of conscience” [Stimme des
Gewissens]. (BT 313
T
)
“
But precisely because the conscience is such a familiar
element of our moral/psychological/theological mythology—one
that has been assessed, disputed, and interpreted in manifold
ways—it is likely to occur here as a tired concept reduced to
ambiguity in the idle talk of the “they.” So Heidegger emphasizes
that he is positing the voice of conscience as an existential
phenomenon. That is, like our attunements, which cannot be
ascertained without being inhabited, the voice of conscience
is there, waiting to happen, and so is only heard when Dasein,
attuned in anxiety, wants a conscience. Thus, it is never factual,
only factical.
As a phenomenon of Dasein, conscience is not
just a fact which occurs and is occasionally
present-at-hand. It ‘is’ only in Dasein’s kind of
Being, and makes itself known as a Fact only
with factical existence and in it. (BT 313
T
)
“
334
SPEAKING BEING
SARAH
Yeah, well that was it and it was like, it’s “I’m an incompetent parent.”
WES
Someone is willing to say what’s so, rather than give a reason for it or try to explain what it all
means, deal with the signifi cance of it...
SARAH
And it was real clear to him, “you’re still my mother. You’re my mother!” He said that! And
in all the discussing about The Forum with people in my life it never occurred to me to talk
to him.
WES
Yeah, it only occurred to you to talk to yourself.
SARAH
Oh, I love that one.
(laughter)
Yeah, he talked to me. He got up early to come talk to me. I left him—maybe I shouldn’t say
this—we were out of kitty litter. The cat pooped on the carpet and I told him to clean it up and
go buy more kitty litter. It’s not like I have to do it for him. Yeah.
(applause)
KIPP
Thank you Sarah.
WES  (to the group)
Your whole life has been lived inside of meanings, explanations, reasons, and justifi cations.
The lowest level in which human beings can live their life... I’m now going to give you a name
for that. You’re at a place where you can begin to recognize it. Before you were too much in it to
be able to recognize it. You know, like the fi sh cannot recognize water. The fi sh cannot discern
water; it’s everywhere. You’re like a fl ying fi sh, for the moment. You jumped out of the water,
and you looked back to see the water. And when you discern the water, you can take that back
into the water: That’s possible. It’s an analogy for what is occurring in the room: When you get
stuck with anything, it sheds a little light on it. So when you jump out of the water and you see
the water that human beings swim their life in, that water is called reasonableness.
(pausing)
The reasons for people are more important than the results in their life. Human beings care
more about reasons than they do about results. And when you ask people about what hap-
pened and why it happened and how come, you get drawn into a conversation for all your rea-
sons. People trade in reasons. They pretend to care about results, but all they really care about
The call is not something that occurs from time to time in such
a way that lends itself to inductive empirical study, for “the Fact
of conscience cannot present itself at all” (BT 314). Rather than
T
search for empirical instances, to encounter the call, to “hear”
it, requires before all else a transformation in the listener, a shift
from listening away to the “they” to a listening that is altogether
different.
Dasein fails to hear itself, and listens away
to the “they”; and this listening-away gets
broken by the call if that call, in accordance
with its character as such, arouses another
kind of hearing, which, in relationship to
the hearing that is lost, has a character in
every way opposite. If in this lost hearing,
one has been fascinated with the ‘hubbub’
of the manifold ambiguity which idle talk
possesses in its everyday “newness”, then the
call must do its calling without any hubbub
and unambiguously, leaving no foothold for
curiosity. That which, by calling in this manner,
gives us to understand, is the conscience.
(BT 316
T
)
“
First Dasein must find itself as having failed to hear
itself, which refers to the dominant self-reflexive trope of The
Forum: being authentic about one’s own inauthenticity, which
necessitates finding oneself to be inauthentic, that is, to be living
a life not one’s own, all the while pretending one is. This finding
of oneself as inauthentic is the lack that the conscience reveals,
the charge of “Guilty!” which the voice of conscience calls Dasein
to own up to. “To be” means to be falling, to have lost touch with
Being because Being loves to hide. We are left with words that
become dead, as mere transparent husks. But how can we get
those husks to come forward and speak Being? ■

is reasons. “Well I really tried to produce that result. And you know I tried this and I did that,
and this happened and this happened.” “Oh, I understand: Well, as long as you really tried;
as long as you really meant it; you really were sincere.” “I understand” often means, “Okay,
I’ll give you that one as long as you put up with my bullshit for not producing the result I said
I would produce. You’ll accept that then, too, right?” See you’re either at The Forum on time
or you’re not. You’re either on the airplane when it leaves or you’re not. The airplane does not
care about the traffi  c jam you got into. It just leaves, and you stand there like a jerk watching
it leave, complaining about the unfairness of life. You either keep your word or you don’t, with
regard to life. Life is not fair. Children think life should be fair. Some people—most peo-
ple—never grow out of that, and they argue about the fairness or unfairness of life, and their
reasons for what they have done and why they did it, and why it should have been this way,
and their story, and it’s all stuck together; and people are asleep, and what keeps them asleep
is reasonableness. And by the way, it is very real when you’re discussing it. The basis for your
reasonableness ultimately is your commitment to your story. But the level of living your life
we’re discussing now is called reasonableness, and it stinks. You know, like, we invite you to
participate in something and you will deal with “why are we doing that?” and “should I be do-
ing that?” and “how come we’re doing that?” and “what’s really happening?” And you’ll never
deal with the off er and the possibility of the off er. So one way to listen to Sarah’s sharing is:
Somebody who’s willing to give up reasons in her relationship with her son, and relate to him,
like straight, like “here’s what I say and I’ll take what you say and out of what we say to each
other, we’ll be committed to it as itself and not deal with all the story about it that’s not being
communicated.” So, she can acknowledge being an incompetent parent, which by the way
is only a conversation anyway—which I know you know—but it opens something up. That
conversation opens something up. She doesn’t have to explain it, and justify it, and make her
son wrong, like he’s the reason for her incompetence. He doesn’t have to deal with her reasons.
He can just deal with her self, and they can deal with each other. See: That’s a breakthrough.
That’s what’s possible in terms of participating in life when you can step out of your story, and
let the fl oor be there, let life be there, let your self be there, embrace it, and play with it. But you
have to give something up. You have to give up your signifi cance and your commitment to rea-
sonableness. You need to know what it looks like, really. What you look like—your story, and
your reasons for it, and the justifi cations for it—really are absurd. Time for another newspaper
article. I’m going to show you what a life looks like, carried to the extreme, when someone’s
commited to some meaning, some signifi cance, some reasons and justifi cations for their life.
Here Wes read a newspaper article which demonstrated reasonableness carried to an extreme. It
was the obituary, from the Los Angeles Times, of the musician Billy Tipton, who had died earlier in
1989. It was headed “Death reveals musician who lived as man to be woman.” At her death at the
age of 74, it was revealed to friends and family that Tipton, who had lived as a man, had been in
reality a woman. Tipton died poor, said Wes, and tired of keeping her secret.
WES
There you go. Aren’t you tired? Of keeping the secret? Think it’s worth giving the secret up?
You think it’s worth giving up what you’ve been withholding from life? You know what you’ve
been withholding from life? Your self. What you’ve been giving to life is your secret; what
336
SPEAKING BEING
you’ve been withholding from life is your self. And you put the two together and you look at life
from the possibility that you’re going to die: What’s the point? I mean really, what is the point?
Why not just give it up? Where’s Kevin? I wasn’t in the room earlier. I hear you turned in your
video release today. Congratulations. That’s giving something up. I invited you last night to
confront what it costs, the risk... you want to share about that?
KEVIN
Kind of funny, because after I got my standing ovation from everyone, I sat here thinking, “I
don’t want to put my hand up, because I’ve already received too much attention. So I’ll just sit
here.” And it took me about, I don’t know, a half an hour before I fi nally realized “I could put
my hand up and they could choose me whenever they wanted. I wasn’t in control...”
(laughter)
WES
That’s very good.
KEVIN
Yeah, I got a lot...
WES
Wait, let me just use that, because a number of people have been coming up to me demanding
I call on them to share. You ought to get what Kevin is saying. You either will or you won’t and
you’ll know it at the end of The Forum if you’ve been called on. Don’t worry about it because it
doesn’t mean anything anyway.
KEVIN
And you’re not going to get any more out of it if you’re called on.
WES
You want to listen. That’s when you get something out of The Forum. The Forum takes place in
your listening.
KEVIN
And I know that because as I was sitting here, I was thinking about that, “well, it doesn’t mat-
ter if I get called on, if I get called on, that’s fi ne, I get called on.”
ERHARD
It’s not even fi ne. You get called on, you get called on.
KEVIN
You’re right.
WES (continuing)
Forum Day Four: Session One
337
ERHARD
And if you don’t get called on, you don’t get called on.
KEVIN
You’re right.
ERHARD
And that’s the way that it is. And you could make a great big drama out of that. “Wes doesn’t
like me. Kipp doesn’t like me even more. Nobody likes me. They’re trying to torture me. I really
got something to say that’s important. I gotta get up here, nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
nah nah.” Very good Kevin. Go on.
KEVIN
I was like that. Is it okay if I say something to somebody else in the group?
ERHARD
Not usually. But in your case we’ll make an exception. Go ahead.
(laughter)
I appreciate your asking.
KEVIN
Well I’d like to talk to someone in the group but I’m not quite sure how to handle it, but I’ll
count on you to stop me if I get out of line. I heard myself, as I told you before, I had every-
body’s racket so maybe I’m a good person to talk to everybody because I’ve got everybody’s
racket. But maybe everybody here has everybody’s racket... But there was a young person last
night that really got to me because I saw myself in that young person, maybe twenty, thirty
years ago, and I really wish I could talk to that young person but I don’t think I’ll be able to talk
to that young person because I got a feeling that that young person probably isn’t listening to
me right now.
WES
Actually I think they are. I think everybody is. I don’t believe what you... I don’t accept what
you’re saying. So let me tell you what you are saying: The future needs to be just like the past;
nobody can learn from anything. Everybody has to go through the same mistakes. It’s bullshit.
Something’s happening in the room in the conversation where the person twenty years young-
er than you, Kevin, is getting you. And the benefi t of the twenty years you screwed your life up.
KEVIN
I’m sorry, but I think that’s completely wrong, because I think that person’s sitting there
thinking “I can’t possibly learn anything from this old fart,” and...
338
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
They do say that but it doesn’t make any diff erence anyhow.
(applause)
And let me tell you what they learn from you, Kevin. Young people don’t learn from our
preaching. They learn from who we are. You know, you can’t miss your magnanimity. You
cannot miss it; it can’t be missed.
KEVIN
My magnanimity?
ERHARD
Yes, your magnanimity.
KEVIN
I’ll have to work on that a little later. If I can get that together with my stinginess, that’s gonna
take a lot of work.
ERHARD
Remember one thing. Stinginess is not a quality inside you. It’s a product of your actions. And
magnanimity is the same thing. You give yourself being big when you get off  it. When you’re
being moved in here by other people’s sharing, you can’t help it. I suppose you might be able
to do it, but it would be very diffi  cult to be in here and not be moved by people. And what
moves us is not their story. That may entertain us but it isn’t what moves us. What moves us
is their magnanimity. Magnanimity arises in action, like the act of getting off  it. That’s real
magnanimity. We don’t have a good way of talking about it because I have to say “you have to
be big,” and it sounds like some quality inside. There are no qualities inside people. Qualities
arise in action. And yes, yesterday you were being stingy, and you’re a bit thrown to being
stingy, and what you said last night gave you a possibility beyond being stingy. You know, you
bit the bullet. You spoke straight. And anytime somebody bites the bullet and talks straight
a possibility beyond their inauthenticity arises. And you gave yourself a new possibility last
night. You want to listen up because I’m putting this in words that you might fi nd a bit hard
to, you know, a bit hard to deal with.
KEVIN
I’m dealing with them.
ERHARD
Okay very good. So, last night in speaking straight and speaking yourself and being authentic
about your inauthenticity, you created a possibility beyond your inauthenticity, and today you
acted in that possibility...
And what moves us is not their story. That may
entertain us but it isn’t what moves us. What
moves us is their magnanimity. Magnanimity
arises in action, like the act of getting off  it.
“
Forum Day Four: Session One
339
(referring to the video form)
and in that action there was magnanimity. There was being big. And it’s extraordinarily attrac-
tive. I mean extraordinarily attractive, and I don’t mean it looks good, Kevin.
KEVIN
No. The nice thing about it is that I don’t even need it now.
ERHARD
Exactly.
KEVIN
Now that I got it I don’t need it.
ERHARD
Now, let’s get that one last thing straight for everybody. That’s right. Nobody pays any attention
to your opinion. Nobody pays any attention to your expression of what you agree or disagree
with. Particularly young people don’t pay much attention to it. They’re organized not to pay any
attention to it. They need not to pay any attention to it. They’re struggling to establish them-
selves. And they cannot get away from the message delivered by who you are. That makes a
diff erence for them no matter what their stance in the matter is. Okay, please go on.
KEVIN
Well this person I saw as me twenty or thirty years ago. I don’t even know how many charac-
teristics of this person I want to describe... but there was a lot of defi ance in the statement that
was made.
ERHARD
Defi ance?
KEVIN
Defi ance, defying you. And when I fi rst came here I still had some of that defi ance. I’m sure
that...
(laughing)
I know why they’re laughing.
ERHARD
And the smile on your face is an expression of being able to be with their laughing, which is a
lot more powerful than being insulted by it or wondering why they are laughing.
KEVIN
So I think I probably had a pretty good need to take you on. And I probably wouldn’t have
taken you on because I understand how stupid it is to take you on, even if I wanted to take you
340
SPEAKING BEING
on, because I’m playing on your fi eld and you’re going to win. There’s no question about that,
even if I’m as good as you are. By last night I didn’t have the need to take you on anymore. I
didn’t care if I took you on. And I didn’t care if I won. And I didn’t care if I lost if I took you on.
It didn’t make any diff erence. So that was really good. So, back to the young person I am trying
to get to. I don’t know why: There’s some reason I’m trying to get to this person and I don’t
understand what that is. Somebody came up to me last night after I fi nished and said that must
have really been hard to do. Last night was not hard to do. Today is hard to do.
ERHARD
Stingy is easy. Magnanimous is not easy.
KEVIN
So, to this person, I came in here and I’m a person who has spent their whole life—I’m 56 years
old—I spent my whole life, I don’t think, ever trying to look into my head, until just recently,
and so I’m new at this game. I’m not a head looker. I’ve been busy being successful and all that
and so I’m looking at this young person. Not a real young person. Just getting a little beyond
young, but really defi ant, really pissed off  about something. I wanted to say to that person “Hey
look boy, I’m the biggest case of all,” which I’m sure a lot of you are saying “No, I am.” But I
know I am the biggest case of all, that came into here thinking  “Boy, I’m going to have to put
up with a lot of bullshit,” but I think there must be something to this thing, and I’m clever
enough that I can get around the bullshit, and sort that out, do it my way and control it, and fi g-
ure out whether there was really anything good in this and I’ll extract out what I think is good
in this and I’ll let the bullshit slide by my ear. And the reason that I think I’m able to get some-
thing out of this: I’m lucky I guess. I came into this, well, the only way I can get something out
of this is if I just really say “okay, push those thoughts out of your mind, and get something out
of this. I’m gonna get something out of this. I’m going to get into this.” And I’ve really gotten
into it, and last night was a hell of a night, because I went to bed and it was a long time before I
went to sleep, thinking. My head was exploding going through all these things, my assignment
and everything else, and boy, did I make progress. I’m not sure... Something happened, I’ve
had so many breakthroughs...
Let’s get clear. It’s not progress, it’s dropping stuff .
KEVIN
I’ve dropped a load they must have heard...
(laughter)
At least four or fi ve fl oors down.
ERHARD
That’s generous Kevin. That’s generous. That’s generosity. Sharing “winning” is generosity.
KEVIN (continuing)
Forum Day Four: Session One
341
KEVIN
So to this young person who doesn’t have much time left to get something out of this Forum.
ERHARD
Never mind the editorial.
KEVIN
This person is looking forward to really getting the job done at the next event, because this
person’s talking about the next event, where this person’s going to get the job done. And I don’t
think this person’s going to get the job done in the next event unless they start right now get-
ting the job done at this event. That’s what I have to say.
(applause)
WES
Kevin, I appreciate your generosity, so I’m gonna share a poem with you.
Here Wes read the e e cummings poem, “What gets you is nothing.”
WES (completing the poem)
So you’ve been gotten, and what got you is nothing. It is inescapable. What there is to be gotten
by—to be used by—in The Forum is nothing. If that now sounds like possibility to you, if now
you hear that communication as possibility—you don’t understand it...
KEVIN
I feel like I understand it.
WES
Maybe you do. I’m saying, even if you don’t. If it just has that sense of possibility to it, raise
your hand.
(most of the participants raising their hands)
How many don’t?
(a few raising their hands)
Okay. So are you complete Kevin?
KEVIN
No. I still have my homework assignment.
WES
Those who don’t: Your job is to transform the conversation we’re having now, somehow, into
possibility. You notice that a lot of people in the room have done that. That’s your job now.
Your job. That’s where the value of your money occurs.
342
SPEAKING BEING
KEVIN (almost crying now)
I did my assignment; I almost didn’t do it. I called my wife this morning. I had forgotten that I
was supposed to ask her if I was selfi sh. So I asked her if I’m selfi sh. Her fi rst response was to
laugh.
(laughter)
It wasn’t a big laugh.
(bigger laughter)
I really mean that, I wasn’t trying to be cute I don’t think. But it was a genuine laugh. And I
wasn’t quite sure what that was going to be followed by. And she paused for a minute and was
thinking. And then she said, “Well, you do have to have control.” And so I was sitting there
dealing with that. And then she said “But you’ve got a lot of good qualities to off set it.” I’m not
trying not to cry. I don’t know what I’m trying to do. I’ve certainly never cried in front of a
group like this.
Let me tell you something. Anytime you actually meet yourself, it’ll move you to tears.
KEVIN
Well I’m not worried about crying. In some respects I wish I could cry.
ERHARD
That’s close enough. What you’re doing is fi ne.
KEVIN
So I told her I loved her and she told me she loved me and that was the end. I’m complete.
Thanks.
ERHARD
Good.
(long applause)
WES
Just because we’re committed to you, we’re going to give those of you who raised your hand,
those of you who didn’t get possibility yet, we’re going to give you one more shot at waking the
fuck up.
(laughter)
ERHARD  (lightly)
No scatological language, Wes, please.
What is Said When Conscience Calls?
The call of conscience is a calling to listen past the hubbub and
to be brought back to one’s Self, but the “they” is not entirely
circumvented; one cannot leap over what it means to be human.
Rather, the “they” self plays an essential role:
But the fact that the call passes over both the
r
“they” and the manner in which Dasein has
been publicly interpreted, does not by any
means signify that the “they” is not reached
too. Precisely in passing over the “they” (keen
r
as it is for public repute) the call pushes it into
insignificance. But the Self, which the appeal
has robbed of this lodgment and hiding-place,
gets brought to itself by the call. (BT 317
T
)
“
Forum Day Four: Session One
343
Kipp asked those who did not see possibility in empty and meaningless to stand. About fi fteen peo-
ple stood; one of them received a microphone.
WES
There’s just one last little piece stuck to it, a little piece of meaning stuck to it keeps possibility
from occurring.
Kipp confi rmed with those standing that they are yet to be “clear” about life being empty and
meaningless and that it is empty and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless.
ERHARD
Hold on. Is it that you don’t get it or you don’t like it? Which is it with you?
ANABETH
I don’t see either. I thought the question was: “do we see possibility?”
ERHARD
We’re restating the question. The question is: Did you get that it is empty and meaningless, and
that it’s empty and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless? Did you get that?
ANABETH
Yes.
ERHARD
Good, then we apologize for misleading you. You’re welcome to sit down now.
(several participants sitting down)
The only people who should be standing are those who didn’t get that it’s empty and meaning-
less and that it’s empty and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless. So that’s what you
didn’t get.
BRADLEY
I don’t think so.
ERHARD
Who should I ask?
(to a seated participant)
Did he get that?
(laughter)
Should I ask him? Who should I ask?
In the language of The Forum, the concern for looking good and
being right, inauthentic to the core, gets revealed as empty, as
lacking any ultimate ground, as utterly without meaning. That is,
the “they” self is not some inner self enclosed within the frame
of the external world; rather, it “is” only by virtue of Being-in-the-
world.
But if conscience occurs as a call, as a summons that passes
over the “they” self, what form does it take? What is said in the
call? The call is not vocal utterance; nevertheless, as calling, it is a
mode of discourse:
But how are we to determine what is said in
the talk that belongs to this kind of discourse?
k
What does the conscience call to him to whom
t
it appeals? Taken strictly, nothing. The call
asserts nothing, gives no information about
world-events, has nothing to tell. Least of
all does it try to set going a ‘soliloquy’ in the
Self to which it has appealed. ‘Nothing’ gets
called to this Self, but it has been summoned to
d
itself—that is, to its ownmost potentiality-for-
Being. (BT 318
T
)
“
The call of conscience, says Heidegger, is discourse in the mode
of silence, and its message is unequivocal: it says nothing: the
call speaks through what is left unsaid. Any misunderstanding
of this message is due not to its mis-calling, but to interference
from the soliloquy through which the “they” self (i.e., the socially
constructed identity) interprets the call (BT 318–19). Thus the
T
“nothing,” revealed in anxiety through the call of conscience,
holds the possibility of authentic self-revelation.
Throughout Heidegger’s thought we find the essentiality
of non-Being as the other side of Being; and Heidegger takes
full advantage of the rhetorical possibilities of the nothing,
recognizing the opportunities for paradox and reflexion which
arise in discussing a “something” which is “nothing.” We mean
“rhetorical” in two related senses. The first is its essential sense
as the use of language for the primal assignment of meaning as

شما واقعاً یک پسر سنگین هستید ، مگر نه؟ کنت
بله و من در آخر نشاط زیادی را از دست داده ام ... از طرف شرکت کنندگان خنده وجود داشت ، زیرا عدم وجود نشاط بسیار مشهود بود. کله
شما همچنین استاد عدم درک هستید. کنت (خنده)
و داشتن یک نمای خاص که واقعاً فکر می کردم کار می کند. کله
و شما باید آن چیز را سنگین و قابل توجه نگه دارید! کنت
درست و پس از آن به معنای فریب دادن نیست. کله
درست کنت
ووو کله
معنی این است که سنگین و قابل توجه بودن نیست و هر چیز دیگری که می گویید ، این به معنای آن است. کنت
درست قبل از شام دیشب نور کردم. کله
بله ، و این گهواره را از شما ترساند. می بینید که خطرناک است ببینید ، آنچه در حال حاضر هستید آشنا است. ترسیده ، غمگین ، ناراحت. این همان چیزی است که شما "شما" می نامید. هر چیز دیگری ناآشنا است. ناآشنا است
بی دست و پا ، شرم آور ، بنابراین شما هر چیزی را که آشنا باشد ، می گیرید ، حتی اگر زندگی شما را از بین ببرد. کنت
بله ، در وقت شام احساس خوبی کردم ، مثل این که شاید بتوانم از این شکاف پیاده شوم. من آنجا یک حس واقعی داشتم
از سبکی و بعد سنگین شدم. روز چهارم: جلسه یک

و این راهی است که برای شما خواهد بود. چند نفر از شما متوجه شده اید که همه چیز در حال باز شدن است
و بسته شدن ، باز کردن و بسته شدن ، باز کردن و بسته شدن ، باز کردن و بسته شدن؟ (بسیاری از دست ها بالا می روند)
دستان خود را پایین بگذارید. حال ، چند نفر از شما دوست دارید که برای همیشه باز بمانید؟ (بسیاری از دست ها بالا می روند)
و این همان چیزی است که شما را احمق می کند. کنت
اوه کیپ (با صدای بلند)
زیرا به محض باز شدن ، باز کردن شما به معنای چیزی است. این روش زندگی است
باید الان باشد! کنت
بله ، این همان کاری است که من کردم. کله
بله ، شما یک رویداد می خواهید. شما نمی خواهید زندگی کنید ؛ شما یک رویداد می خواهید. کنت
بله من یک درام در اطراف این رویداد می خواهم. کله
و بنابراین شما درام در مورد این رویداد خواهید داشت. همه می خواهند یک رویداد ، یک جواب آسان ، بنابراین آنها
دیگر نیازی به سؤال مجدد نیست ، یا دوباره فکر کنید ... آیا با مردم به اشتراک گذاشتید؟ کنت

من در مورد از دست دادن شغل خود ، در مورد فقیر کنت ، در مورد اینکه چرا احساس می کنم یک کنت فقیر وجود دارد ، به اشتراک گذاشتم
آنجا من در طول آموزش نسبتاً روشن شدم که چرا یک چیز ضعیف کنت دارم ، چه
این به زندگی من انجام می شود. من به اشکهایی که در اینجا تجربه کرده ام نرسیدم. این جدید است من آن را در آموزش نداشتم. احساس می کنم زندگی من دو سال گذشته وارونه شده است
پایین و این باعث ترساندن گهواره از من می شود. کله
نه ، آنچه اتفاق افتاده است ، شما کنار گذاشته اید ، و ازدواج شما ... کنت است
ازدواج من در حال خاتمه دادن است. کله
در حال خاتمه دادن است. شما به نظر می رسد که این یک کامپیوتر خاموش است. (خنده)

شما می فهمید که شور و شوق تهدیدی برای بقای شما است؟ شادی تهدیدی برای بقای شماست؟ خود بیان تهدیدی برای بقای شماست؟ من نمی گویم هیچ یک از اینها خوب است ، یا راه
شما باید باشید ، و روشی که هستید راهی نیست که باید باشید. من این را نمی گویم ؛ آسان است
آن را بشنو من فقط می گویم که شما از بیشتر زندگی قفل شده اید. یکی بهتر از دیگری نیست. اما در حال حاضر شما چاره ای ندارید. کنت
خوب است که یک انتخاب داشته باشید. کله
این به شما آزادی می دهد که یک انتخاب داشته باشید. کنت
بله ، این همان چیزی است که دیشب برای کمی احساس کردم. کله
بله ، و با دقت ، این احساس نبود. کنت
این همان چیزی است که من دیشب دیدم. کله

راکت من "من یک والدین بی کفایت هستم." و به عنوان افرادی که دیشب با من شام خوردم
به شما می گویم ، شما به هر جایی نزدیک به آن می روید و دوست دارید ، این بقای است ، این جنگ است. مثل شما ، شما

در مورد چه چیزی صحبت می کنید؟ جنگ چیست؟ بقای چیست؟ سارا
مثل من ... راکت من "من یک پدر و مادر بی کفایت هستم."

شما یک والدین بی کفایت هستید. سارا

و اگر کسی حتی به آن نزدیک شود ... کیپ
و شما را به عنوان والدین سؤال می کنید؟ سارا
آنها حتی لازم نیست که آن را نزدیک کنند. شما می دانید ... کیپ
خوب سارا
بنابراین ، دیشب ، ام ، من همیشه به بعضی دیگر نگاه می کردم ... همیشه موجودات ، و آنها را دیدم
همانطور که ، می دانید ، هیچ معنایی برای آنها وجود ندارد. به گذشته ام نگاه کردم. من اهل جنوب هستم ،
و من به بعضی از این چیزهای جنوبی که داریم نگاه کردم. و من واقعاً آن را گرفتم: شما می توانید به داخل آن پرش کنید
آن بازی ، یا شما نمی دانید ، آنجا است. و من به من نگاه کردم "من یک بخش بی کفایت هستم
ent "و وحشت" ، و من واقعاً وحشت را احساس کردم ، و نمی توانستم به معنای خالی و خالی برسم
بی معنی من نمی توانم آن را بدست آورم ؛ من تمام شب آن وحشت را داشتم. و من شخصی را فهمیدم که
ایستاد و گفت: "وقتی بچه کوچک بودم خجالت کشیدم و هرگز خجالت نمی کشم." او
تماس وجدان
همانطور که نشان دادیم ، هم برای مارتین هایدگر و هم ورنر ارهارد ،
تجربه فعلی انسان اساساً از دست رفته است
چیزی هایدگر منبع این غیبت را در
فرضیات سنت متافیزیکی ، که درک آنهاست
جهان شامل قلمرو پس زمینه ای نیست که او صدا می کند
بودن در این مرحله از توسعه آن سنت ، هر چیزی
مفقود شده نیز فراموش شده است. و فراتر از فراموش شده بعدی-
ness فراموشی است (به آخرین نوار کناری جلسه سه روز مراجعه کنید
چهار) هایدگر می گوید: "بودن" هنوز منتظر زمان است
این به انسان تحریک کننده خواهد شد "(" LH "در BW 227). بنابراین بنابراین.
حرف
یک کار اصلی این انجمن ارائه این کمبود است
به گونه ای که به یک امکان جدید برای وجود تبدیل شود. با این حال ، انسان ، هنگام گوش دادن به "آنها"
خود ، از مقابله با هرگونه نقص با پذیرش حواس پرتی خودداری کنید ،
از دست دادن خود در راه های دنیایی که در آن وجود دارد
پرتاب شده است به یاد داشته باشید که خود داسین راهی برای موجود است ،
و نحوه وجود ما این است که در آغوش امکاناتی که ما هستیم قرار بگیریم
برای ما پیدا کنید - بازوهای "آنها" ، دنیای کنجکاوی ، بیکار
پچ پچ و ابهام ، که عموم بی اساس را تشکیل می دهد
گفتمانی که همیشه درست است ، و برای آنها هیچ چیز جدیدی نیست. اما
با سقوط ، ما گم می شویم ، که در آن "Dasein هیچ انتخابی نمی کند ،
توسط هیچ کس [خود "آنها" یا به عنوان erhard همراه می شوند
گاهی اوقات آن را صدا می کند ، خود "هر کسی"] و به این ترتیب خود را درگیر می کند

شاید ، ترور در آنجا. و ترور آنجا بود. من نمی توانستم از آن خارج شوم. من زیبا دارم
مفهوم آن و من می توانم در مورد آن استعاره ها را به شما بگویم ، اما آنجا بود. امروز صبح بلند شدم و
مثل این است ... پسرم وارد شد و او روی تخت می نشیند. او گفت: "مامان ، در مورد این چیز به من بگو
شما انجام می دهید. " قبل از اینکه این را به شما بگویم ، بگذارید کمی در مورد پسرم برای شما بگویم.
در یک بیمارستان روانی. او اکنون سیزده است. و من گفتم: "خوب ، ما در مورد چگونگی ما صحبت می کنیم
انسان و ما در مورد چگونگی داشتن این موارد برای ما صحبت کرده ایم
وقتی واقعاً کوچک بودیم ، و او گفت: "منظور شما آن چیزهایی است که ما از زمان ما می دانیم
متولد شده اند؟ " گه (خنده)
بنابراین من می گویم "بله". به هر حال ، و ما ادامه می دهیم و صحبت می کنیم ، و او مرا دنبال می کند ، و من می گویم
"بله ، من به روشی که هستم نگاه می کنم ، و این چیزی است که من در مورد بی کفایت بودن به دست آورده ام
والدین و ترور من با آن. و او می گوید ، "مامان ، شما یک والدین بی کفایت هستید" ، و
سپس او خندید -
(او خنده را نشان می دهد)
"مامان ، ما مرتبط هستیم!"
(تشویق)
و من منفجر می شوم ، در همان زمان می خندم و گریه می کنم ، و او در آنجا ایستاده است و
می گوید: "مامان ، من نمی فهمم که شما می خندید و گریه می کنید ، اما نگاه نکنید ، من گریه می کنم." بود
مانند ... بعداً صبح او روی تخت نشسته بود و گربه را وحشت می کرد. بنابراین من می گویم "اکنون
اگر کسی وارد شود و گربه را به روشی که وحشت می کنید ، وحشت می کنید چه کاری انجام می دهید
گربه؟ " "خوب من شلیک می کنم." و من گفتم ، "من فقط نمی دانم در مورد آن چه کاری انجام دهم." و او
می گوید: "خوب شما یک والدین بی کفایت هستید!"
(خنده)
من گفتم "من آن را گرفتم. اگر گربه را وحشت می کردم ، شما چه می کنید؟" و او گفت: "من به شما می گویم
جلوی آن را بگیرید. " و من گفتم: "خوب ، از ترس و وحشت گربه دست بردارید." و او انجام داد.
کار زیادی سارا
بله کله
این درام بوده است و این فاجعه ، و نحوه کار کردن آن ، و چه کاری باید انجام شود ... سارا
"چگونه می توانم این کار را با شما انجام دهم تا شما را متوقف کنید تا از گربه وحشت کنید؟"
کله
بله ، ایجاد یک استراتژی و به دنبال گزینه ها. عدم اطمینان "(BT 312). چنین زندگی ممکن است آسان ، جالب و
حرف
دلپذیر اما هرگز خود شخص نیست. و با این حال: از آنجا که این تنها شیوه وجود ما است
با تجربه ، چگونه می توانیم بدانیم که هر حالت دیگری است
موجود است؟ آنچه لازم است یک اشاره ، یک محصول ، یک جهت است: "از نظر
هایدگر می گوید ، "دازین می گوید ، از احتمال آن استفاده می کند
حرف
در حال حاضر یک پتانسیل است-
Fore-fort-خود ، اما باید این امکان را گواهی دهد "
(BT 313 ، تأکید اضافه شده است). برای این منظور ، ما معرفی شده ایم
حرف
در اینجا به یک دوست قدیمی که بدون شک با آن روبرو شده ایم
قبل از آن:
[زیرا] داسین در "آنها" گم شده است ، باید
ابتدا خود را پیدا کنید. به منظور یافتن خود ، اصلاً ،
باید به خودی خود "نشان داده شود"
اصالت بشر بشر . این پتانسیل [-For-being-
خود آن] توسط آنچه در Dasein's تأیید شده است ، تأیید شده است
تفسیر روزمره از خود ، آشنا است
برای ما به عنوان "صدای وجدان" [Stimme des
Gewissens]. (BT 313
حرف
)
"
اما دقیقاً به این دلیل که وجدان چنین آشنا است
عنصر اساطیر اخلاقی/روانی/کلامی ما - یکی
که در منیفولد ارزیابی ، مورد اختلاف و تفسیر شده است
راهها - احتمالاً در اینجا به عنوان یک مفهوم خسته کاهش می یابد
ابهام در صحبت های بیکار از "آنها". بنابراین هایدگر تأکید می کند
اینکه او صدای وجدان را به عنوان یک وجودی مطرح می کند
پدیده این ، مانند ضمیمه های ما ، که نمی تواند باشد
بدون سکونت ، صدای وجدان را مشخص کرد
آیا در آنجا وجود دارد ، منتظر اتفاق می افتد ، و فقط وقتی داسین شنیده می شود ،
در اضطراب ، وجدان می خواهد. بنابراین ، هرگز واقعی نیست ،
فقط واقعی به عنوان پدیده داسین ، وجدان نیست
فقط واقعیتی که رخ می دهد و گاهی اوقات است
در حال حاضر این فقط در نوع داسین است
بودن ، و خود را فقط به عنوان یک واقعیت شناخته می کند
با وجود واقعی و در آن. (BT 313

بله ، خوب این بود و مثل این بود ، "من یک والدین بی کفایت هستم."
وهمی
کسی مایل است بگوید چه چیزی است ، نه اینکه دلیلی برای آن بیان کند یا سعی کند توضیح دهد که چه چیزی
به معنای آن است ، با یک کنسرو قابل توجه آن برخورد کنید ... سارا
و برای او کاملاً واضح بود ، "شما هنوز مادر من هستید. شما مادر من هستید!" او این را گفت! وت
در تمام بحث در مورد انجمن با افراد زندگی من هرگز برای من اتفاق نیفتاد
به او وهمی
بله ، فقط برای شما پیش آمد که با خود صحبت کنید. سارا
اوه ، من آن یکی را دوست دارم. (خنده)
بله ، او با من صحبت کرد. او زود بلند شد تا بیا با من صحبت کند. من او را ترک کردم - شاید نباید بگویم
این - ما از بستر بچه گربه خارج بودیم. گربه روی فرش خم شد و من به او گفتم که آن را تمیز کند و
برو بستر بچه گربه بیشتر. اینگونه نیست که من باید این کار را برای او انجام دهم. بله (تشویق)

تمام زندگی شما در معانی ، توضیحات ، دلایل و کاتیونهای توجیه شده زندگی کرده است. پایین ترین سطح که در آن انسان ها می توانند زندگی خود را زندگی کنند ... من اکنون می خواهم به شما نامی بدهم
برای آن شما در مکانی هستید که می توانید آن را تشخیص دهید. قبل از اینکه بیش از حد در آن قرار داشته باشید
قادر به تشخیص آن باشید. می دانید ، مانند FI SH نمی تواند آب را تشخیص دهد. fi sh نمی تواند تشخیص دهد
آب این همه جا است شما برای لحظه ای مانند یک fl ying fi sh هستید. شما از آب پریدید ،
و برای دیدن آب به عقب نگاه کردید. و وقتی آب را تشخیص می دهید ، می توانید آن را پس بگیرید
به آب: این امکان پذیر است. این یک قیاس برای آنچه در اتاق اتفاق می افتد است: وقتی می گیرید
با هر چیزی گیر کرده است ، کمی روشن می شود. بنابراین وقتی از آب بیرون می روید و می بینید
آبی که انسان در آن زندگی می کند ، آن را به آب معقول می نامند. (مکث)
دلایل افراد مهمتر از نتایج در زندگی آنها است. مراقبت از انسان
بیشتر در مورد دلایل نسبت به نتایج. و وقتی از مردم می پرسید در مورد چه چیزی
قلم زده و چرا این اتفاق افتاد و چگونه آمد ، شما برای همه واکنش های خود به مکالمه کشیده می شوید
پسران مردم با دلایل تجارت می کنند. آنها وانمود می کنند که به نتایج اهمیت می دهند ، اما همه آنها واقعاً به آنها اهمیت می دهند
تماس چیزی نیست که هر از گاهی در چنین مواردی رخ دهد
راهی که خود را به مطالعه تجربی القایی تبدیل می کند ، برای "واقعیت
وجدان نمی تواند به هیچ وجه خود را ارائه دهد. »(BT 314). به جای
حرف
به دنبال نمونه های تجربی ، برای مواجهه با تماس ، "شنیدن"
این ، قبل از همه چیز دیگری در شنونده ، یک تغییر است.
از گوش دادن به "آنها" به گوش دادن که در کل است
متفاوت Dasein نتواند خودش را بشنود و گوش می دهد
به "آنها" ؛ و این شنیدن
در صورت تماس در صورت تماس ، مطابق با تماس
با شخصیت خود به همین ترتیب ، دیگری را برانگیخته است
نوع شنوایی ، که در رابطه با
شنوایی که گم شده است ، شخصیتی دارد
از هر راه برعکس اگر در این شنوایی از دست رفته ،
یکی مجذوب "hubbub" شده است
از ابهام منیفولد که صحبت بیکار است
در "تازه بودن" روزمره خود ، سپس
تماس باید تماس خود را بدون هیچ گونه HubBub انجام دهد
و بدون ابهام ، جای جای جای خود را نمی گذارد
کنجکاوی چیزی که با فراخوانی به این روش ،
به ما می دهد تا درک کنیم ، وجدان است. (BT 316
حرف
)
"
Dasein اول باید خود را پیدا کند که در شنیدن آن نتوانسته است
خود ، که به تروپ غالب خود بازتابنده اشاره دارد
انجمن: معتبر بودن در مورد عدم اعتماد به نفس شخصی ، که
نیاز به پیدا کردن خود به عنوان غیرقانونی بودن ، یعنی زندگی کردن
زندگی یک شخص نیست ، در حالی که وانمود می کند. این یافته
از خود به عنوان غیر معتبر ، عدم وجود وجدان آشکار است ،
اتهام "گناهکار!" که صدای وجدان آن را داسین می نامد
مالکیت تا "بودن" به معنای سقوط ، از دست دادن تماس با او
بودن به این دلیل که عاشق پنهان شدن است. ما با کلماتی باقی مانده ایم که
مرده شوید ، به عنوان پوسته های شفاف صرف. اما چگونه می توانیم بدست آوریم
آن پوسته ها برای جلو آمدن و صحبت کردن؟ ■

دلایل است "خوب من واقعاً سعی کردم آن نتیجه را تولید کنم. و شما می دانید که من این کار را امتحان کردم و این کار را کردم.
و این اتفاق افتاد و این اتفاق افتاد. " "اوه ، من می فهمم: خوب ، تا زمانی که واقعاً سعی کردید.
تا زمانی که شما واقعاً منظورش این بود ؛ شما واقعاً صمیمانه بودید. " "من می فهمم" اغلب به معنای "خوب ،
من آن را به شما می دهم تا زمانی که شما به دلیل عدم تولید نتیجه ای که گفتم با گلوله من کنار بیایید
من تولید می کردم شما آن را قبول خواهید کرد ، پس ، درست است؟ " ببینید که به موقع در انجمن هستید
یا شما نیستید شما هنگام ترک هواپیما در هواپیما هستید یا نه. هواپیما چنین نمی کند
در مورد مربای قاچاق که وارد آن شده اید ، مراقبت کنید. فقط می رود ، و شما مانند یک حرکت تند و سریع در آنجا ایستاده اید
این کار را ترک می کند و از ناعادلانه بودن زندگی شکایت می کند. شما یا کلمه خود را حفظ می کنید یا نمی کنید ،
با توجه به زندگی زندگی عادلانه نیست. کودکان فکر می کنند زندگی باید عادلانه باشد. بعضی از افراد- بیشتر مردم
Ple - هرگز از این امر رشد نمی کنند ، و آنها در مورد انصاف یا ناعادلانه زندگی و آنها بحث می کنند
دلایل آنچه آنها انجام داده اند و چرا این کار را انجام داده اند ، و چرا باید از این طریق بوده است ،
و داستان آنها ، و همه در کنار هم قرار گرفته اند. و مردم در خواب هستند ، و آنچه آنها را در خواب نگه می دارد
منطقی است و به هر حال ، وقتی در مورد آن بحث می کنید ، بسیار واقعی است. مبنای شما
استدلال در نهایت تعهد شما به داستان شماست. اما سطح زندگی شما
ما در حال بحث هستیم که اکنون استدلال نامیده می شود و بد بو می شود. شما می دانید ، مانند ، ما شما را به آن دعوت می کنیم
در چیزی شرکت کنید و با "چرا ما این کار را می کنیم؟" و "باید انجام دهم-
این؟ " و "چگونه ما این کار را می کنیم؟" و "واقعاً چه اتفاقی می افتد؟" و شما هرگز
با ER و احتمال خاموش کردن برخورد کنید. بنابراین یکی از راه های گوش دادن به اشتراک سارا این است:
کسی که مایل است در رابطه با پسرش دلایل خود را تسلیم کند و با او ارتباط برقرار کند ،
مانند مستقیم ، مانند "این همان چیزی است که من می گویم و آنچه را که شما می گویید و از آنچه ما به هر یک می گوییم می گیرم
دیگر ، ما به عنوان خود به آن متعهد خواهیم بود و با تمام داستان در مورد آن که موجود نیست مقابله نمی کنیم
ارتباط برقرار کرد. " بنابراین ، او می تواند پدر و مادر بی کفایت را تصدیق کند که به هر حال
به هر حال فقط یک مکالمه است - که می دانم شما می دانید - اما این چیزی را باز می کند. این که
مکالمه چیزی را باز می کند. او لازم نیست آن را توضیح دهد ، و آن را توجیه کند و او را بسازد
پسر اشتباه ، مثل او دلیل بی کفایتی او است. او مجبور نیست با دلایل خود مقابله کند. او فقط می تواند با خود خود سر و کار داشته باشد و آنها می توانند با یکدیگر برخورد کنند. ببینید: این یک موفقیت موفقیت آمیز است. این چیزی است که از نظر شرکت در زندگی ممکن است وقتی می توانید از داستان خود خارج شوید ، و
بگذارید در آنجا حضور داشته باشد ، بگذارید زندگی در آنجا باشد ، اجازه دهید خودتان در آنجا باشید ، آن را در آغوش بگیرید و با آن بازی کنید. اما تو
باید چیزی را تسلیم کنید. شما باید از کنسرو قابل توجه خود و تعهد خود برای واکنش استفاده کنید
Sonableness شما باید بدانید که واقعاً چگونه به نظر می رسد. آنچه شما به نظر می رسید - داستان شما ، و
دلایل شما برای آن ، و کاتیون های توجیهی برای آن - واقعاً پوچ است. زمان روزنامه دیگر
مقاله. من می خواهم به شما نشان دهم که زندگی به نظر می رسد ، به شدت ، وقتی کسی است ، به شدت منتقل شده است
به برخی از معناها ، برخی از دلایل قابل توجه ، برخی دلایل و کاتیونهای توجیهی برای زندگی خود. در اینجا وس مقاله روزنامه ای را خواند که نشان دهنده معقول بودن به یک افراط و تفریط بود. من
اوبیتو ، از لس آنجلس تایمز ، نوازنده بیلی تیپتون بود که در اوایل درگذشت
1989. این ریاست "مرگ فاش می کند که نوازنده ای که به عنوان مرد زندگی می کرد ، زن شد." در مرگ او در
سن 74 سالگی ، برای دوستان و خانواده مشخص شد که تیپتون ، که به عنوان یک مرد زندگی کرده بود ، در آن حضور داشته است
واقعیت یک زن. وس گفت: تیپتون فقیر درگذشت و از مخفی نگه داشتن او خسته شد. وهمی
آنجا می روید خسته نیستی؟ از راز نگه داشتن؟ فکر می کنید ارزش راز را دارد؟ شما فکر می کنید ارزش آن را دارد که از زندگی خودداری کنید؟ شما می دانید چه چیزی دارید
از زندگی خودداری کرده اید؟ خودت آنچه شما به زندگی داده اید راز شماست ؛ چه
336
وجود
شما از زندگی خودداری کرده اید. و شما این دو را کنار هم قرار می دهید و به زندگی نگاه می کنید
از این احتمال که می خواهید بمیرید: نکته چیست؟ منظورم واقعاً چیست؟ چرا فقط آن را رها نمی کنیم؟ کوین کجاست؟ من زودتر در اتاق نبودم. من می شنوم که شما به خود تبدیل شده اید
انتشار ویدیو امروز. تبریک می گویم این چیزی است که می دهد من دیشب شما را دعوت کردم
مقابله کنید که هزینه آن چیست ، خطر ... شما می خواهید در مورد آن به اشتراک بگذارید؟ کوین
خنده دار است ، زیرا بعد از اینکه او را از همه ایستاده ام ، در اینجا نشستم و فکر کردم ، "من
نمی خواهم دستم را بالا ببرم ، زیرا من قبلاً توجه زیادی را به خود جلب کرده ام. بنابراین من فقط می نشینم
اینجا. " و من نمی دانم ، من نمی دانم ، نیم ساعت قبل از اینکه واقعاً متوجه شدم "می توانم قرار دهم
دست من بالا و آنها می توانند هر زمان که می خواستند مرا انتخاب کنند. من کنترل نمی کردم ... "
(خنده)
وهمی
این خیلی خوب است کوین
بله ، من چیزهای زیادی کردم ... وس
صبر کنید ، بگذارید فقط از آن استفاده کنم ، زیرا تعدادی از مردم خواستار من شده اند
من از آنها می خواهم که به اشتراک بگذارند. شما باید آنچه را که کوین می گوید دریافت کنید. شما یا خواهید کرد یا شما پیروز نخواهید شد و
اگر به شما فراخوانده شده باشد ، آن را در پایان انجمن می دانید. نگران آن نباشید زیرا
به هر حال به معنای چیزی نیست. کوین
و اگر از شما خواسته شده است ، دیگر نمی خواهید از آن خارج شوید. وهمی
شما می خواهید گوش دهید این زمانی است که شما چیزی را از انجمن خارج می کنید. این انجمن در
گوش دادن شما کوین
و من می دانم که چون من در اینجا نشسته بودم ، در مورد آن فکر می کردم ، "خوب ، این کار نیست
اگر به من زنگ بزنم ، اگر به این موضوع فراخوانده شوم ، این امر به من فراخوانده می شود. "
درز
این حتی Fi Ne نیست. شما تماس می گیرید ، تماس می گیرید. کوین
درست است وس (ادامه)
روز چهارم: جلسه یک
337
درز
و اگر به شما زنگ نزنید ، به شما زنگ نمی زنید. کوین
درست است درز
و این روشی است که هست. و شما می توانید یک درام بزرگ بزرگ از آن بسازید. "وس
مثل من کیپ من را حتی بیشتر دوست ندارد. هیچ کس من را دوست ندارد. آنها سعی می کنند من را شکنجه کنند. من واقعاً
چیزی برای گفتن مهم است من باید از اینجا بلند شوم ، نه نه نه نه ناح نه
نه نه. " کوین بسیار خوب است.
من اینگونه بودم اشکالی ندارد اگر من به شخص دیگری در گروه چیزی بگویم؟ درز
معمولاً نیست اما در مورد شما ما یک استثنا خواهیم کرد. برو جلو (خنده)
من از پرسیدن شما قدردانی می کنم کوین
خوب من می خواهم با کسی در گروه صحبت کنم اما من کاملاً مطمئن نیستم که چگونه آن را اداره کنم ، اما من خواهم بود
اگر من از خط خارج شوم ، روی خود حساب کنید تا من را متوقف کنید. من خودم را شنیدم ، همانطور که قبلاً به شما گفتم ، همه
راکت بدن بنابراین شاید من فرد خوبی باشم که با همه صحبت کنم زیرا من همه را پیدا کرده ام
راکت اما شاید همه افراد اینجا راکت همه را داشته باشند ... اما آخرین بار یک جوان بود
شب که واقعاً به من رسید زیرا من خودم را در آن جوان دیدم ، شاید بیست ، سی
سالها پیش ، و من واقعاً آرزو می کنم که بتوانم با آن جوان صحبت کنم اما فکر نمی کنم بتوانم صحبت کنم
به آن جوان چون احساس کردم که جوان احتمالاً گوش نمی دهد
من الان وهمی
در واقع من فکر می کنم آنها هستند. من فکر می کنم همه هستند. من آنچه را که تو باور ندارم ... من قبول نمی کنم
شما می گویید بنابراین بگذارید به شما بگویم چه می گویید: آینده باید دقیقاً مانند گذشته باشد.
هیچ کس نمی تواند از هر چیزی یاد بگیرد. همه باید همان اشتباهات را پشت سر بگذارند. این گلوله است در مکالمه ای که در آن شخص بیست سال جوان است ، در اتاق اتفاق می افتد-
از شما ، کوین ، شما را می گیرد. و سود بیست سالی که زندگی خود را پیچیدید. کوین
متاسفم ، اما فکر می کنم این کاملاً اشتباه است ، زیرا فکر می کنم آن شخص در آنجا نشسته است
فکر می کنم "من نمی توانم از این گوز قدیمی چیزی یاد بگیرم ،" و ... 338
وجود
درز
آنها این حرف را می زنند ، اما به هیچ وجه تفاوت چندانی ندارد. (تشویق)
و بگذارید به شما بگویم که آنها از شما چه می آموزند ، کوین. جوانان از ما یاد نمی گیرند
موعظه آنها از چه کسی یاد می گیرند. می دانید ، نمی توانید بزرگواری خود را از دست بدهید. شما
نمی توان آن را از دست داد. نمی توان از دست داد. کوین
بزرگواری من؟ درز
بله ، بزرگواری شما. کوین
کمی بعد باید روی آن کار کنم. اگر بتوانم آن را با استینگ خود همراه کنم ، این اتفاق می افتد
کار زیادی کنید درز
یک چیز را بخاطر بسپار استینگ بودن در درون شما کیفیتی نیست. این محصول اقدامات شما است. وت
بزرگواری همان چیز است. شما به خودتان بزرگ می شوید وقتی از آن پیاده می شوید. وقتی تو هستی
با اشتراک گذاری افراد دیگر در اینجا منتقل می شوید ، شما نمی توانید به آن کمک کنید. من فکر می کنم شما ممکن است بتوانید
انجام این کار ، اما این بسیار متفاوت خواهد بود که در اینجا حضور داشته باشید و توسط مردم منتقل نشود. و چه
ما را حرکت می دهد داستان آنها نیست. این ممکن است ما را سرگرم کند اما این چیزی نیست که ما را به حرکت درآورد. چه چیزی ما را سوق می دهد
بزرگواری آنهاست بزرگواری در عمل بوجود می آید ، مانند عمل پیاده شدن از آن. این واقعی است
بزرگواری ما روش خوبی برای صحبت در مورد آن نداریم زیرا باید بگویم "شما باید
بزرگ باشید. "و به نظر می رسد برخی از کیفیت در داخل
در عمل بوجود می آیند. و بله ، دیروز شما لکنت داشتید ، و کمی به وجود می آیید
استینگ ، و آنچه شما دیشب گفتید ، فراتر از لکنت بودن به شما امکان می داد. شما می دانید ، شما
گلوله را بیت کنید. شما مستقیم صحبت کردید و هر وقت کسی گلوله را نیش می زند و مستقیم صحبت می کند
احتمال فراتر از عدم صحت آنها بوجود می آید. و آخرین بار به خودتان امکان جدیدی داده اید
شب شما می خواهید گوش دهید زیرا من این را با کلماتی قرار می دهم که ممکن است کمی سخت باشد
می دانید ، مقابله با آن کمی سخت است. کوین
من با آنها سر و کار دارم درز
خوب خیلی خوب بنابراین ، دیشب در صحبت مستقیم و صحبت کردن و اصالت بودن
در مورد عدم اعتماد به نفس خود ، شما یک امکان فراتر از عدم اعتماد به نفس خود ایجاد کرده اید ، و امروز شما
در این امکان عمل کرد ... و آنچه ما را به حرکت در می آورد ، داستان آنها نیست. که ممکن است
ما را سرگرم کنید اما این چیزی نیست که ما را به حرکت درآورد. چه
ما را حرکت می دهد ، بزرگواری آنها است. بزورگرایی
مانند عمل پیاده شدن در عمل بوجود می آید. "
روز چهارم: جلسه یک

(مراجعه به فرم ویدیویی)
و در آن عمل بزرگنمایی وجود داشت. بزرگ بود و این فوق العاده جذاب است-
پرهیز منظورم فوق العاده جذاب است ، و منظورم این نیست که خوب به نظر می رسد ، کوین. کوین
نه. نکته خوب این است که من حتی به آن احتیاج ندارم. درز
دقیقاً کوین
حالا که آن را گرفتم ، نیازی به آن ندارم. درز
حال ، بیایید آخرین چیز را مستقیماً برای همه بدست آوریم. درست است هیچ کس توجه نمی کند
به نظر شما هیچ کس به بیان آنچه شما موافق یا مخالف هستید توجه نمی کند
با به ویژه جوانان توجه زیادی به آن نمی کنند. آنها سازماندهی شده اند که هیچ هزینه ای را پرداخت نکنند
توجه به آن آنها نیازی به توجه به آن ندارند. آنها در تلاشند تا آنها را تأسیس کنند-
خود و آنها نمی توانند از پیام تحویل داده شده توسط شما دور شوند. این باعث می شود
بدون توجه به اینکه موضع آنها در این موضوع چیست ، تفاوت برای آنها وجود دارد. خوب ، لطفا ادامه دهید. کوین
خوب این شخص را به عنوان من بیست یا سی سال پیش دیدم. من حتی نمی دانم چه تعداد کاراکتر
تریک این شخص که می خواهم توصیف کنم ... اما در این بیانیه چیزهای زیادی وجود داشت که
ساخته شد درز
defi ance؟ کوین
دلهره ، از شما سرپیچی می کند. و هنگامی که من اولین بار به اینجا آمدم ، من هنوز مقداری از این موارد را داشتم. من مطمئن هستم
که ... (خنده)
من می دانم که چرا آنها می خندند. درز
و لبخند روی صورت شما بیان این است که می تواند با خنده آنها باشد ، که این یک است
خیلی قدرتمندتر از توهین به آن یا تعجب که چرا آنها می خندند. کوین
بنابراین فکر می کنم احتمالاً نیاز خوبی برای شما داشتم. و من احتمالاً نخواهم داشت
شما را به این دلیل که می فهمم چقدر احمقانه است که شما را ببرد ، حتی اگر می خواستم تو را بگیرم چقدر احمقانه است
340
وجود
در ادامه ، زیرا من در FI OLD شما بازی می کنم و شما می خواهید برنده شوید. هیچ سوالی در این مورد وجود ندارد ،
حتی اگر من به اندازه شما خوب باشم. دیشب دیگر نیازی به این کار نداشتم. من
اهمیتی نمی دادم که شما را ادامه دهم. و من اهمیتی نمی دادم که برنده شوم. و من اهمیتی نمی دادم اگر شما را از دست بدهم. این هیچ مشکلی ایجاد نکرد. بنابراین واقعاً خوب بود. بنابراین ، به جوانی که سعی می کنم برگردم
برای رسیدن به من نمی دانم چرا: دلیلی وجود دارد که من سعی می کنم به این شخص برسم و نمی کنم
بفهمید این چیست دیشب بعد از اینکه من نپرداختم ، کسی به من آمد و گفت که باید
واقعاً سخت بوده است دیشب سخت نبود. امروز سخت است. درز
استینگ آسان است. بزرگنمایی آسان نیست. کوین
بنابراین ، برای این شخص ، من به اینجا آمدم و من فردی هستم که تمام زندگی خود را گذرانده ام - 56 سال است
قدیمی - من تمام زندگی خود را گذراندم ، فکر نمی کنم ، تا به حال سعی کنم به ذهنم نگاه کنم ، تا همین اواخر ،
و بنابراین من در این بازی جدید هستم. من نگاه کننده سر نیستم. من مشغول موفقیت آمیز و همه اینها بوده ام
و بنابراین من به این جوان نگاه می کنم. یک جوان واقعی نیست. فقط کمی فراتر از آن
مورچه های جوان ، اما واقعاً Defi ، واقعاً در مورد چیزی دلخور شد. من می خواستم به آن شخص بگویم "سلام
به پسر نگاه کن ، من بزرگترین مورد از همه هستم "، که من مطمئن هستم که بسیاری از شما می گویند" نه ، من هستم ". اما من
بدانید که من بزرگترین مورد از همه هستم ، که به اینجا وارد شدم "پسر ، من باید قرار دهم
با گلوله های زیادی ، "اما فکر می کنم باید چیزی برای این کار وجود داشته باشد ، و من باهوش هستم
به اندازه کافی که بتوانم در اطراف گلوله ها قرار بگیرم ، و آن را مرتب کنم ، این کار را به روش خود انجام دهم و آن را کنترل کنم ، و fi g-
آیا واقعاً در این مورد خوب وجود دارد و من آنچه را که فکر می کنم خوب است استخراج می کنم
در این و من اجازه می دهم که گلوله ها توسط گوشم بکشند. و دلیل اینکه فکر می کنم قادر به دریافتم هستم
چیزی از این: من خوش شانس هستم که حدس می زنم. من وارد این شدم ، خوب ، تنها راهی که می توانم چیزی را بیرون بیاورم
از این این است که اگر من واقعاً می گویم "خوب ، آن افکار را از ذهن خود بیرون بکشید و چیزی را بیرون بیاورید
از این من از این چیزی می خواهم. من می خواهم به این موضوع بپردازم. " و من واقعاً بدست آمده ام
در آن ، و شب گذشته جهنم یک شب بود ، زیرا من به رختخواب رفتم و مدت زمان زیادی قبل از آن بود
به خواب رفت ، فکر کرد. سر من در حال انفجار همه این چیزها ، تکلیف من بود
و هر چیز دیگری ، و پسر ، من پیشرفت کردم. من مطمئن نیستم ... اتفاقی افتاده است ، من
پیشرفت های زیادی داشت ... بگذارید روشن شویم. این پیشرفت نیست ، در حال رها کردن چیزها است. کوین
من یک بار را که آنها باید شنیده ام انداختم ... (خنده)
حداقل چهار مورد یا fi ve fl پایین. درز
این کوین سخاوتمند است. این سخاوتمندانه است این سخاوت است به اشتراک گذاشتن "برنده" سخاوت است. کوین (ادامه)
روز چهارم: جلسه یک
341
کوین
بنابراین برای این جوان که وقت زیادی برای خارج کردن چیزی از این بخش باقی نمی ماند. درز
هرگز به سرمقاله توجه نکنید. کوین
این شخص مشتاقانه منتظر است تا واقعاً کار را در رویداد بعدی انجام دهد ، زیرا این
شخص در مورد رویداد بعدی صحبت می کند ، جایی که این شخص قصد دارد کار را انجام دهد. و من نمی کنم
فکر کنید این شخص قصد دارد کار را در رویداد بعدی انجام دهد ، مگر اینکه آنها در حال حاضر شروع کنند-
کار انجام شده در این رویداد. این همان چیزی است که من باید بگویم. (تشویق)
وهمی
کوین ، من از سخاوت شما قدردانی می کنم ، بنابراین می خواهم شعری را با شما به اشتراک بگذارم. در اینجا وس شعر e e e cummings را خواند ، "آنچه شما را نمی کند هیچ چیز نیست."
وس (تکمیل شعر)
بنابراین شما به دست آمده اید ، و آنچه شما به دست آورد هیچ چیز نیست. غیرقابل اجتناب است آنچه برای بدست آوردن وجود دارد
توسط - برای استفاده توسط - در انجمن هیچ چیز نیست. اگر اکنون این به نظر شما امکان پذیر است ، اگر اکنون
شما این ارتباط را به عنوان امکان می شنوید - شما آن را درک نمی کنید ... کوین
احساس می کنم آن را درک می کنم. وهمی
شاید شما این کار را انجام دهید. من می گویم ، حتی اگر اینطور نیست. اگر فقط این حس را برای آن دارد ، بالا می برد
دست شما (بیشتر شرکت کنندگان دست خود را بالا می برند)
چند نفر نیستند؟ (چند نفر دست خود را بالا می برند)
خوب پس آیا شما کامل هستید؟ کوین
نه. من هنوز تکالیف تکالیف خود را دارم. وهمی
کسانی که این کار را نمی کنند: کار شما این است که مکالمه ای را که اکنون داریم ، به نوعی به آن تبدیل کنید
امکان متوجه می شوید که بسیاری از افراد در اتاق این کار را کرده اند. این کار شما اکنون است. کار شما این جایی است که ارزش پول شما رخ می دهد. 342
وجود
کوین (تقریباً گریه می کند)
من تکلیف خود را انجام دادم من تقریباً این کار را نکردم. امروز صبح با همسرم تماس گرفتم. من فراموش کرده ام که من
قرار بود از او بپرسد که آیا من خودم هستم؟ بنابراین من از او پرسیدم که آیا من خودم هستم؟ اولین پاسخ او به این بود
خندیدن (خنده)
این یک خنده بزرگ نبود. (خنده بزرگتر)
من واقعاً منظورم این است که ، من سعی نمی کردم ناز باشم که فکر نمی کنم. اما این یک خنده واقعی بود. و من
کاملاً مطمئن نبودم که چه چیزی دنبال خواهد شد. و او یک دقیقه مکث کرد و بود
فکر کردن و سپس او گفت ، "خوب ، شما باید کنترل داشته باشید." و بنابراین من آنجا نشسته بودم
برخورد با آن و سپس او گفت "اما شما ویژگی های خوبی برای خاموش کردن آن دارید." من نیستم
سعی می کنم گریه نکنند. من نمی دانم چه کاری می خواهم انجام دهم. من مطمئناً هرگز در مقابل a گریه نکرده ام
گروه مانند این بگذارید چیزی به شما بگویم. در هر زمان که واقعاً خود را ملاقات می کنید ، شما را به اشک می اندازد. کوین
خوب من نگران گریه نیستم. از بعضی جهات کاش می توانستم گریه کنم. درز
این به اندازه کافی نزدیک است کاری که شما انجام می دهید fi ne است. کوین
بنابراین من به او گفتم که من او را دوست دارم و او به من گفت که او مرا دوست دارد و این پایان است. من کامل هستم ممنون درز
خوب (تشویق طولانی)
وهمی
فقط به این دلیل که به شما متعهد هستیم ، می خواهیم به شما کسانی که دست خود را بلند کرده اند ، بدهیم
کسانی از شما که هنوز امکان پذیر نیستید ، ما می خواهیم یک ضربه دیگر در بیدار کردن از خواب به شما بدهیم

لطفا بدون زبان پراکندگی ، لطفا. وقتی وجدان تماس می گیرد چه گفته می شود؟ تماس وجدان خواستار گوش دادن به گذشته از هوبوب و
برای بازگشت به خود شخص ، اما "آنها" کاملاً نیست
دور نمی توان از آنچه که انسان بودن بودن بودن است ، جهش کند. در عوض ، خود "آنها" نقش اساسی را ایفا می کنند:
اما این واقعیت که تماس از هر دو عبور می کند
حرف
"آنها" و شیوه ای که داسین دارد
به طور عمومی تفسیر شده است ، به هیچ وجه
به این معنی است که به "آنها" رسیده است
بیش از حد دقیقاً در عبور از "آنها" (مشتاق
حرف
همانطور که برای اعتبار عمومی است) تماس آن را به داخل سوق می دهد
ناچیز اما خود ، که جذابیت دارد
از این اقامتگاه و مخفیگاه سرقت کرده است ،
با تماس به خودش آورده می شود. (BT 317
حرف
)

روز چهارم: جلسه یک
343
کیپ از کسانی که امکان ایستادن در خالی و بی معنی را ندارند ، پرسید. در مورد fi fteen peo-
PLE ایستاد یکی از آنها میکروفون دریافت کرد. وهمی
فقط یک قطعه کوچک آخر که به آن چسبیده است وجود دارد ، یک قطعه کوچک از آن که به آن گیر کرده است ، امکان پذیر است
از اتفاق kipp با کسانی که ایستاده اند ، در مورد خالی بودن زندگی "روشن" نیست
بی معنی است و این خالی و بی معنی است که خالی و بی معنی است. درز
نگه داشتن آیا این است که شما آن را دریافت نمی کنید یا آن را دوست ندارید؟ کدام یک با شماست؟ آناب
من هم نمی بینم من فکر کردم سوال این است: "آیا ما امکان می بینیم؟"
درز
ما در حال بازگرداندن این سوال هستیم. سوال این است: آیا دریافتید که خالی و بی معنی است ، و
این خالی و بی معنی است که خالی و بی معنی است؟ این را گرفتی؟ آناب
بله درز
خوب ، پس از گمراه کردن شما عذرخواهی می کنیم. شما هم اکنون می توانید بنشینید. (چندین شرکت کننده که نشسته اند)
تنها افرادی که باید ایستاده باشند ، کسانی هستند که دریافت نکردند که خالی و معنی دارد-
کمتر و این خالی و بی معنی است که خالی و بی معنی است. این همان چیزی است که شما
دریافت نکرد زن
من فکر نمی کنم درز
از چه کسی باید بپرسم؟ (به یک شرکت کننده نشسته)
آیا او آن را گرفت؟ (خنده)
باید از او بپرسم؟ از چه کسی باید بپرسم؟ به زبان انجمن ، نگرانی از نگاه خوب و
درست بودن ، غیر معتبر هسته ، به همان اندازه خالی آشکار می شود.
فاقد هرگونه زمین نهایی ، کاملاً بدون معنی. یعنی ،
خود "آنها" برخی از خود درونی نیستند که درون قاب قرار دارد
از جهان خارجی ؛ در عوض ، این فقط به واسطه بودن "است"
جهان اما اگر وجدان به عنوان یک فراخوان اتفاق می افتد ، به عنوان احضاریه که می گذرد
بیش از خود "آنها" ، چه شکلی می گیرد؟ آنچه در
تماس بگیرید؟ تماس سخنان صوتی نیست. با این وجود ، به عنوان تماس ، آن است
نحوه گفتمان:
اما چگونه می توانیم آنچه را که در آن گفته می شود تعیین کنیم
صحبت هایی که متعلق به این نوع گفتمان است؟ k
وجدان چه چیزی با او به چه کسی زنگ می زند
حرف
تجدید نظر می کند؟ به شدت گرفته شده ، هیچی. تماس
هیچ چیزی را ادعا نمی کند ، هیچ اطلاعاتی در مورد آن نمی دهد
رویدادهای جهانی ، چیزی برای گفتن ندارد. حداقل
همه این موارد سعی می کند یک "انحصار" را در آن قرار دهد
خود که درخواست تجدید نظر کرده است. "هیچ چیز" نمی شود
به این خود فراخوانده شد ، اما احضار شده است
د
خود-یعنی به خودی خود بیشترین پتانسیل-
بودن (BT 318
حرف
)
"
هایدگر می گوید ، ندای وجدان گفتمان در حالت است
از سکوت ، و پیام آن کاملاً واضح است: هیچ چیزی نمی گوید:
Call از طریق آنچه ناگفته مانده است صحبت می کند. هرگونه سوء تفاهم
از این پیام ناشی از نامناسب بودن آن نیست ، بلکه به تداخل است
از سولیاکی که از طریق آن "آنها" (یعنی از نظر اجتماعی "
هویت ساخته شده) تماس را تفسیر می کند (BT 318-19). بنابراین
حرف
"هیچی" در اضطراب از طریق فراخوان وجدان ،
امکان وحی معتبر خود را در اختیار دارد. در طول فکر هایدگر ما ضروری را می یابیم
از عدم استفاده به عنوان طرف دیگر وجود ؛ و هایدگر می گیرد
مزیت کامل از امکانات بلاغی هیچ چیز ،
شناخت فرصت های پارادوکس و بازتاب
در بحث "چیزی" که "هیچ چیز" نیست ، بوجود آمده است. منظور ما
"بلاغی" در دو حس مرتبط. اولین حس اساسی آن است
به عنوان استفاده از زبان برای تکلیف اولیه معنی
