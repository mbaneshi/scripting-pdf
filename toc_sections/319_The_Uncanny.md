going to be all right. You know how it’s going to be? Just like this. Yeah, it’s not gonna be all right.
It’s going to be like this. You’re either going to make it like this or you aren’t going to make it.
You’re either going to learn to be in prison or you’re just going to be unhappy. You’re going to be
in prison one way or the other. So, why did we talk about empty and meaningless if it isn’t going
to be useful? Because the truth has power not predicated on being useful. The truth has power,
which most people can’t see. You want to get this because Lucy’s question opens this up. The
truth has power, which you can’t see, because you’re only looking for what’s useful. You’re not
looking for power, you’re looking to exploit, to use, to consume. So you can’t see the power of the
truth. So Lucy, what I said was, that the truth has a power that, if you’re only looking for what
you can use, you can’t see. That’s why we had that whole thing about empty and meaningless.
LUCY
I can think of a way that “life being empty and meaningless” can be of use to us and giving us
power.
ERHARD (to the group)
Am I demonstrating my point?
LUCY
One of the many alternatives I can think of...
ERHARD (to the group)
You want to listen to this.
LUCY
I think it revolves around the issue of performance versus expectation and if we tell ourselves
often enough that life is empty and meaningless, our expectations as a consequence would be
set lower over time, potentially...
ERHARD
No.
LUCY
And performance of life relative to expectations, could make us...
ERHARD
That’s wonderful. You ought to do a seminar on that. People would buy that. Look, they bought
thinking positive big. Yeah, I expect there to be a seminar—if you don’t do it, somebody will. So
you ought to do it: The Empty and Meaningless seminar, the purpose of which is to lower your
expectations far enough down that anything feels like winning.
(applause and laughter)
You’re actually having fun with me, aren’t you? She doesn’t mean this, she’s only joking with
me. She’s kidding me. She’s not looking for the answer. She knows there’s no answer. She’s only
kidding with me.
“
...the truth has a power that, if you’re only
looking for what you can use, you can’t
see.

SPEAKING BEING
LUCY
Well, I disagree. I really do. Because I think everything is a state of mind.
ERHARD
Oh absolutely. You go out and tell the bus that. Lucy, you’ve been in too many success seminars.
Everything is not a state of mind. Buses are not a state of mind. I don’t care what anybody has
told you. And the evidence is all on my side.
(responding to a participant not on camera)
Excuse me?
(repeating thoughtfully what the participant said)
A new suit of clothes for the king. Yes. My tongue’s way more tied than yours is; you can’t out
tongue tie me. Yeah, I understand what you said. I was just trying to get it. Yeah, what about it?
(repeating what the participant said—who does not have a microphone)
Is that all in the mind?
(addressing himself out loud)
Let’s see, am I going to give him the truth or just shut him up?
(laughter)
It’s all in the mind.
(laughter. Then seriously)
To stop being a smart-ass about this, I will respond to you. Yes, it is what you and I ordinarily
call “in the mind,” but if we look a little closer, it is not in the mind, it was in the mouth. A suit
of clothes is a conversation, not a mental image. But that is a fi ne point and your point is valid.
Buses are not a suit of clothes, right? It’s not all in the mind.  A lot of people think buses are in
the mind. And they look like they’ve been hit by buses.
(to Lucy)
You all done?
LUCY
Yes, I’m done.
ERHARD
Okay great!
(applause as Lucy sits )
Forum Day Three: Session Four
307
ERHARD
Okay, there’s a certain part of The Forum for which you need to be less tired. I didn’t say not
tired. I said less tired, less tired than you’re going to be if I answer all your questions!
(laughter)
So we’re not going to answer any more questions tonight. Tonight we’re going to...
(after a participant shouted out: “Let’s vote.”)
Does it really make you feel good to vote?
(laughter)
What about “The rug is red? Yeah!”
(laughter)
If you like voting why don’t you vote on stuff  like that? “Yeah! This rug is red! Yeah!”
(clapping with everyone else joining in)
So, we’re not going to keep you up with answering questions, we’re going to keep you up with
an assignment. Stay up at home.
KIPP
Between tonight and tomorrow morning your assignment is to get clear that life is empty and
meaningless. So what you’re going to come up against between tonight and tomorrow morning
is all those places that you say have...
(the group shouts back: “meaning”)
And you’re going to inquire into those to see that they are...
(the group shouts: “meaningless”)
ERHARD
One other thing is to look at where they’ve made it mean something that life is empty and
meaningless. Particularly add that in there.
KIPP
The second part: what you’ve made it mean that life is empty and meaningless. Therefore...
There is also an invitation: to share what’s been opening up for you with people in your life. Get
clear that life is empty and meaningless. And what have you made it mean that life is empty
and meaningless?
The third day of The Forum concluded.
308
SPEAKING BEING
The Forgetting of Being, Part Six of Eight: Saying Nothing
The bundle of concepts associated with non-Being and the negative—emptiness,
meaninglessness, nothingness, nihilism—are of central significance in understand-
ing the rhetorical movement of The Forum. They are likewise fundamental in the
work of Martin Heidegger; and are deeply embedded in the perspective of Zen, an-
other major influence on Werner Erhard’s thinking. According to the Japanese schol-
ar Masao Abe, who has written extensively about the relationship of Zen to Western
thinking, “Martin Heidegger takes the issue of ‘nothingness’ not only with utmost
seriousness, but perhaps with the most profundity in Western history” (Maseo Abe,
Zen and Western Thought 134). For both Heidegger and Erhard, a transformative
ontological event—an experience of Being (of what it means “to be”)—demands an
authentic encounter with Being’s other side; and a conversation that aims to evoke
such an encounter makes special demands, since, says Heidegger, “there is, aft er all,
something peculiar about Nothing” (IM 30).
We cannot overstate the importance of this element in Erhard’s work. Central to
his achievement has been the development of a rhetorical structure—manifested in
both the est Training and The Forum—that consistently provides participants with
an experience of nothingness as a liberating context for their lives. The experience
is evoked by a progression of ontological distinctions, generated in speaking by
the Forum leader and developed dialogically with the participants. What is made
present in the dialogue—heard, though unsaid—is Being; and its presencing occurs
in a particularly dramatic way. One of Heidegger’s central claims is that an experi-
ence of Being must be preceded by an experience of Being’s other side, nonbeing,
which Heidegger called the Nothing. Human existence, he says, means “being held
out into the nothing” (“WM” in BW 103). This requires that one open oneself to an
experience of meaninglessness, an experience that one may encounter in moments
of anxiety, despair, or profound boredom—moments when the meaning of life drops
away, and one confronts existence nakedly, without the familiar comforts of one’s
personal identity. Human beings, says Erhard, are addicted to their identities, and
an addiction cannot be dealt with eff ectively until the addict has “hit bottom.” But
for Forum participants, most of whom have achieved a comfortable level of personal
and professional success, such an experience may never arise—without assistance.
Therefore the function of The Forum is to “raise the bottom” so that participants hit
it; and where this happens is in the confrontation with the Nothing, as the conversa-
tion’s penultimate distinction.
END OF DAY THREE INTERVAL
In Heidegger’s work, of course, the distinctions are presented in writing. While
many of his published works were originally delivered as lectures, and although
he is reported to have been exceptionally dynamic in their delivery, there is little
evidence that dialogue was an element of his pedagogy; and in the cultural context
in which he worked, certainly nothing like the personal interactions of The Forum
would have been possible (see the sidebar “Heidegger’s Pedagogy,” in Session Two
of Day Two).
But consider: while Heidegger’s collected works include 102 volumes, he is gen-
erally acknowledged to have been single-minded in his exploration of one question:
the question of Being and its meaning. As he wrote in 1947, “To think is to confine
yourself to a single thought that one day stands still like a star in the world’s sky”
(“TP” in PLT 4)
T
. Significantly, a few pages later we find: “What is spoken is never, and
in no language, what is said” (“TP” in PLT 11).
T
In Heidegger’s writing, then, the distinctions that he created to speak Being are
generated and communicated in the unspoken/unwritten background. There is, we
propose, a central encompassing distinction—the Distinction—that is hinted at by all
of the distinctions, a “single thought” that remains unspoken and the Same through
all of the turns and evolutions of his thinking. The rubrics for the various distinc-
tions that comprise the Distinction, such as the Same, the they-self, and the Nothing,
occur repeatedly throughout his work as he opens new ways into the distinctions,
beginning from diff erent originating terms. In an essay from a collection entitled
Holzwege (“Woodpaths”), Heidegger wrote this:
“
“Wood” is an old name for forest. In the wood are paths
that mostly wind along until they end quite suddenly in an
impenetrable thicket. They are called woodpaths. Each goes
its particular way, but in the same forest. Oft en it seems as
though one were identical to another. Yet it only seems so.
Woodcutters and foresters are familiar with these paths. They
know what it means to be on a woodpath. (Quoted in Krell,
“Introduction,” BW 34)
W
For the authors of this book, our experience of Werner Erhard’s work has enabled
us in negotiating the “impenetrable thickets” of Heidegger’s writing—if not with the
skill of woodcutters, at least with the sense that we are always on a way.
Krell comments that in Germany, “to be on a woodpath” means to be in a cul-
de-sac, a path that leads nowhere and has no exit. As an analogy for the rhetorical
strategies we find in the work of Werner Erhard, the “no exit” image is of interest.
Forum Day Three: End of Day Three Interval 309
Throughout this book, we are proposing that both Heidegger and Erhard make
important use of reflexive languaging—ideas presented in such a way that they turn
thinking back upon itself, pulling the rug out from under the reader or the listener
(e.g., “This statement is false”). We suggest that the reflexive impulse (reflex, reflec-
tion, self-referentiality, getting the joke) pervades the thinking and the languaging
of both men, most dramatically when they are saying the Nothing. These reflexive
processes share a particular aff inity with the movement of thinking that makes
available an experience of Being, and one view is that they evoke a cul-de-sac.
At a debriefing meeting between sessions of the 1989 Forum, Erhard told The
Forum leaders that the “critical condition of satisfaction” for doing The Forum is
that for the participants it must be inescapable. That is, in Heidegger’s terms, all
exits by which the they-self might escape an authentic confrontation with its own
thrownness must be closed. To this end, a cul-de-sac may be a useful model; and
The Forum’s culminating distinction (as well as the final process of the est Training)
t
may be seen as eff ective speaking of that form.
The French existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre evoked the cul-de-sac image in the
title of his play, No Exit; and one of Heidegger’s most important essays, published in
1947 as the “Letter On Humanism,” was written, in part, as a response to an essay
by Sartre. A comparison of Sartre’s thinking with Heidegger’s is beyond the scope of
this book, but we will gloss the diff erence in this way: for neither man is there an exit
from the trap of the human situation; but for Heidegger, the appropriation of that
situation—the appropriation of entrapment—creates the possibility of authentic
entrapment. The situation becomes the Situation, which gives releasement.  ■
Forum Day Four: Session One
311
When the fi nal day of The Forum began at 9:00 am, Kipp was at the front of the room. As soon as
participants were seated, Kevin, the man who Erhard accused of being stingy, recommending that
he ask his wife about that, walked up onto the platform and handed a piece of paper to Kipp, who
then read it to the group. It was a signed video release form. The participants stood to applaud at
length.
KIPP
That’s exactly what’s going to be required in your lives, to have something beyond what the
past has given you to happen. What you just saw was an act of something beyond being stingy,
something beyond what the past has given him. And like Kevin, you’re attached. It doesn’t take
much to get you deeply rooted in what you are attached to. I think what just struck a chord for
you was to see someone go beyond what life has given them. That’s what it’s going to take to go
beyond what life has given you: all day every day. That’s the choice you’re going to have.
(to Kevin)
Kevin, I appreciate your courage.
(to the group)
Sharing about the empty and meaninglessness that life is, or the meaning that you made of
empty and meaningless.
MARGARET
The only place where empty and meaningless is meaningful, is where it coincides with my
racket, the only hitch is in there... This morning I called someone I’m engaged to...
KIPP  (interrupting)
That was a quick sentence: “the only place where empty and meaningless means something is
where it coincides with my racket”—that’s the part you got to get. You see, where your racket
is, no one dares to tread.
(laughter; to Margaret)
Yes?
MARGARET
My racket is: “I can’t quite have it... I can’t quite have it all.” It’s a joke. It’s such a joke. But I do
run it with a real verve and panache and other words that go with it. I called a former... well I
was engaged to marry him for a year and a half...
KIPP
So it’s perfect. Someone who “can’t quite have it all” gets engaged for a year and a half...
(laughter)
And not married.
SPEAKING
BEING
DAY FOUR
FORUM DAY FOUR:
SESSION ONE
312
SPEAKING BEING
Being-in-the-World: World
The Forum promises participants a transformed perspective
on their lives, which is to say their Being-in-the-world. Martin
Heidegger hyphenated this phrase in his writing to indicate that
the phenomenon must be seen as a whole, as a unitary structure.
However, he said, its parts could be considered separately for
emphasis. Previously, in Session One of Day One, we examined
Being-in, and in Session One of Day Two, Being-with. Here we
consider Heidegger’s view of world.
Inside/Outside
In the Cartesian model of reality, the model that for the most part
determines the way contemporary human beings understand our
relation to the world, knowledge arises from an encounter between
subject and object: the “I”—the human subject, the being that
knows—encounters and comes to know the objects, and thus the
world.
Martin Heidegger’s model of human being as Dasein
challenges this tradition: Dasein and its world do not correspond
to subject and object (BT 87). Knowledge, in the sense that Dasein
T
knows the world, does not result from a human subject’s coming
to understand an objective world separate from itself.
For Heidegger, the assumptions of the Cartesian model were
problematic. That model presupposes that reality consists of an
“outer” realm (that which becomes known, Nature, the objective
world), and a separate “inner” realm of subjectivity that does the
knowing. This inner realm is in some way distinct from the outer
realm that contains everything else; but it is somehow able to
escape its inner realm so that it can get outside and, well, know.
The problem of inner and outer, and the search for a proof
of the “Dasein of things outside me,” has concerned philosophy
since Descartes. But, says Heidegger, if there is such a problem, it
lies with the question itself.
MARGARET  (continuing to laugh)
h
...and I shared my racket with him and I said “and furthermore, it’s your racket, too!” It was so
freeing. I mean it was so great to be straight with him. I said “You keep me around. Our sex wasn’t
that great, so you keep me massaging your racket every now and again. You liked that better
than me massaging your penis.” I mean I was able to be so straight with him. “You want me to
massage your case and you didn’t want anything else. And same with me: I have you buy me off
every once and a while. You buy me wonderful gifts. It’s exactly what we’ve always wanted!”
(laughter)
So that was that on that, and I just noticed...
(more laughter)
And he said, “You mean behind that, I don’t really want a relationship?” and I said, “You
should move to California to be with me...”
(laughter)
There was no hook to it anymore. But I run it with everybody, that my life isn’t quite right. I
started dating some great guys about four months ago. Really great guys, but it can’t be that
great. I’m a runner and hurt my leg, and so I’ve gained a little weight, and so now I’ve got that
schtick going: I can’t not have a schtick about things not being quite right. It’s disgusting! You
know, I never have to be responsible for producing at the level of who I am for my job, ever.
Someone can’t stab into me because they know how much I’ve already sacrifi ced.
KIPP
This is an important part because: some of you are successful and the success keeps the wolves
off  your back. The results are part of the racket, and that’s why there’s no satisfaction in them.
The results are there to avoid the domination; they are not results that leave you satisfi ed, no,
they are there to avoid the responsibility of ever really being responsible. “Don’t touch me,
because I’m the best you’ve got.”
MARGARET
Right. It’s horrible. Yeah, and I see the only way to do it is to state that I’m full of it, and “You
can hold me to account, whether I don’t like it, whether I get snarly, hold me to account.” You
know, my life is brilliant, it works, I’ve got the best life there could be. I really do. And yet I run
this racket as good as anyone. Better.
(laughter)
And then I noticed, where are the miracles? Well, this morning I went for a run and it was
eff ortless! I should have been late with all that I did this morning, but I was on time. I stopped
eating last night when I was full. I even made my deep, profound commitment to ending hun-
ger on the planet into an in-order-to, an in-order-to be liked, to make it, and to sacrifi ce: “oh
woe is me.” And that’s ridiculous.
KIPP  (applause as Margaret sits
(
)s
Thank you very much.
Forum Day Four: Session One
313
ELYSE
I started to feel sick yesterday, and I wondered what was wrong with me that I was sick, and
I’m not supposed to be sick. I could hardly sit in the room last night. During the break last
night we went out for dinner, and I thought “I better go lay down for a while, otherwise I’m not
going to be able to make it, I’m not going to be able to pay attention to what’s happening, I’m
not going to be able to do it.” And I couldn’t see what I couldn’t be with, and fi nally it struck
me. What I couldn’t be with is—because I’d been thinking: “what’s my racket?” I thought that
my racket was that I couldn’t be with how much people loved me because I was afraid that
people didn’t love me, and I saw that that wasn’t my racket at all. My racket is that I’ve had no
capacity to be with how much I love people and express that. I’ve said it like a concept, and I
have to do things in order to express my love for people rather than “be” my love for people.
And I still feel sick, and I have an incredible life and I can hardly be with that.
KIPP
Well, it makes you wrong.
MARGARET
Yes, absolutely. It’s amazing. I wake up every morning and I think, “this isn’t my life, this is
someone else’s life. Somebody’s going to fi nd out about me and they’re going to pull the rug,
and it’s not going to be there anymore, and it’s all going to be fucked.”
KIPP
Well, it already is.
(laughter)
See, if you recall the conversation we started having last night, the clearing that it is to be a
human being that you live in: “there’s something wrong.”
MARGARET
There is. Absolutely.
KIPP
Yeah. And it’s not conceptual. You are “there’s something wrong.” You’ve also made that mean
something. Not only is something wrong, it means something that there’s something wrong.
MARGARET
It shouldn’t be that way.
KIPP
What else?
The ‘scandal of philosophy’ is not that this
proof has yet to be given, but that such proofs
are expected and attempted again and again.
[. . .] If Dasein is understood correctly, it defies
such proofs, because, in its Being, it already
is what subsequent proofs deem necessary to
demonstrate for it. (BT 249
T
)
“
That is, one always knows the world from the position of already
being out there in it.
When Dasein directs itself toward something
and grasps it, it does not somehow first get
out of an inner sphere in which it has been
proximally encapsulated, but its primary
kind of Being is such that it is always ‘outside’
alongside entities which it encounters and
s
which belong to a world already discovered.
(BT 89, emphasis added
T
)
“
On the other hand, there is certainly a sense in which we are
inside:
[E]ven in this ‘being-outside’ alongside
the object, Dasein is still ‘inside,’ if we
understand this in the correct sense; that is
to say, it is itself ‘inside’ as a Being-in-the-
world which knows. And furthermore, the
perceiving of what is known is not a process
of returning with one’s booty to the ‘cabinet’
of consciousness aft er one has gone out and
grasped it; even in perceiving, retaining, and
preserving, the Dasein which knows remains
outside, and does so as Dasein. (BT 89
T
)
“
So the inside/outside dilemma is a false problem. Human beings
know their world through existing in it and coping with it.
314
SPEAKING BEING
MARGARET
Well I can see that it doesn’t mean anything and then I woke up this morning and I thought,
well then I shouldn’t be upset that I didn’t feel good, or that my throat hurts, or that my head
hurts.
KIPP
This is very good now. This is the giving meaning to no meaning. See “If it doesn’t mean any-
thing, therefore, in order to...”
MARGARET
Or if I really got it, I wouldn’t be sick.
KIPP
Right.
MARGARET
I don’t even know if I’m sick. Truth is, I don’t even know.
KIPP
Right. Well, for sure you’d be some other way than you are.
MARGARET
I’m kind of like backed into a corner. I can’t talk about it, so now I should feel a diff erent way
than I feel physically. Which is crazy.
KIPP
No it’s not crazy, it’s called normal. This is normal.
MARGARET
I got it.
KIPP
This is what everybody walks around in every day.
MARGARET
And I also see: I’ve designed my entire life to be protected from anyone fi nding out that that’s so
about me. I’ll produce great, unbelievable results; I’ll create great things around me so that people
won’t fi nd out. It’s so fucking elaborate! People won’t fi nd out about me that all I’m petrifi ed of is
that people don’t love me.
KIPP
You know, I think that we think it’s elaborate. We walk around every day with these signs on
telling everybody exactly the way it is with us.
Circumspection
Heidegger also points out that this antecedent understanding
of the world has a particular quality. The things with which we
concern ourselves in our everyday world are the things that we
use in the business of living. Encountered this way, they are the
material of a phenomenological knowing—a knowing that grows
l
out of Being (BT 95). This knowing may or may not be explicit in
T
our awareness:
How do the beings with which we dwell show
themselves to us primarily and for the most
part? Sitting here in the auditorium we do
not in fact apprehend walls—not unless we
are getting bored. Nevertheless, the walls
are already present before we think them as
objects. (BPP 163
P
)
“
Before they are objects for us, the walls are present as a part of
the equipmental context. In a knowing that arises from Being, I am
not immediately present to the things in my world in the role of
contemplator, one who seeks to understand and describe them.
Rather I encounter and use them in the business of living:
The nearest things that surround us we call
equipment. There is always already a manifold
of equipment: equipment for working, for
traveling, for measuring, and in general things
with which we have to do. (BPP 163
P
)
“
Forum Day Four: Session One
315
MARGARET
That obvious, right?
KIPP
It’s that obvious for everybody, isn’t it, except you walk around like it’s not that obvious.
MARGARET
Well, for me it’s never lived like that. It’s always been that I’ve had to make sure it was fl awless,
to cover all the little seams up, so people wouldn’t fi nd out.
KIPP
Wouldn’t fi nd out?
MARGARET
That I was afraid that people wouldn’t love me, and the one I was hiding most from is me, or
that I love people. It sounds like such a stupid thing to say. That I walked around like I was a
machine. I’ve been like a machine.
KIPP
What do you mean by that?
MARGARET
Well, like... the easiest way I can say it is I had no right to be. I was always trying to get some-
where or do something.
KIPP
Yeah, but what I’m saying is that’s a little conceptual... I don’t hear you sharing yet.
MARGARET (after a long pause)
Okay. I called my mother. I was very upset with my mother, because I just got married a month
ago. She didn’t want to come to my wedding.
KIPP
No no. She didn’t want to come to the wedding or she didn’t come to the wedding.
MARGARET
She didn’t come to the wedding. But I had it that she didn’t want to come to my wedding and it
meant all these things.
KIPP
It meant?
How do I understand these things?
The view in which the equipmental contexture
stands at first, completely unobtrusive
and unthought, is the view and sight of
practical circumspection, of our practical
everyday orientation. “Unthought” means
that it is not thematically apprehended for
deliberate thinking about things; instead,
in circumspection we find our bearings in
regard to them. Circumspection uncovers and
understands things primarily as equipment.
[. . .] We say that an equipmental contexture
environs us. (BPP 163, emphasis added
P
)
“
I can of course assume a detached role in relation to the world,
taking on understanding as a science, or an intellectual task to be
accomplished. But this always happens against the background
of the world I already know from being in it. The background
understanding comes first.
World is not something subsequent that
we calculate as a result from the sum of all
beings. The world comes not aft erward but
beforehand, in the strict sense of the word.
[. . .] The world as already unveiled in advance
is such that we do not in fact specifically
occupy ourselves with it, or apprehend it, but
instead it is so self-evident, so much a matter
of course, that we are completely oblivious to
it. (BPP 165
P
)
“
It is, in a metaphor often employed by Werner Erhard, like water to
a fish: fundamental to existence, yet unavailable to our purview.
We see the beings within that purview—they occur as extant, which
for Heidegger means that they occur as substantial things in the
world.
316
SPEAKING BEING
MARGARET
She didn’t love me. “What’s wrong with me that she didn’t want to come to my wedding? How
could that be?” And you know it was funny because when she fi rst told me—that she wasn’t
coming to my wedding—it was fi ne. At fi rst I got it, and then I had it mean something.
KIPP
So what it means that your mother wasn’t coming to your wedding is...
MARGARET
She wasn’t coming to my wedding.
KIPP
“My mother’s not coming to my wedding.”
MARGARET
And then I had it mean something.
KIPP
You had it mean what?
MARGARET
First it meant that there was something wrong with me that she wasn’t coming to my wedding.
If I wasn’t the way I was, she would come to my wedding. There was something wrong with
me. And then I had it mean that she didn’t love me.
KIPP
Which means that there’s something wrong with her.
MARGARET
Right.
KIPP
Everybody know that’s the next step after there’s something wrong with you? There’s some-
thing wrong with them.
MARGARET
And then um, you know, I called her during the couple months before I got married and I
would talk to her, and I could see that when I started to have that she wasn’t coming to my
wedding means something, all I could do was talk to her as an in-order-to: in order to get her
to come to my wedding; in order to get her to love me. I even went from, “if she’s not going to
come to my wedding, the least she could do was tell me that she loves me.” And it was just... It’s
funny, because I just called her up, two days ago during a break, and I said to her, “I just called
But the world itself is of a different order of being. The
world itself occurs as Dasein does; and Da-Sein, remember,
is both Being-there and, for Heidegger Being-a-clearing. The
phenomenon is like nothing we are accustomed to thinking; thus
Heidegger’s presentation of the situation is provocative:
The world is not the sum total of extant
entities. It is, quite generally, not extant at all.
It is a determination of [B]eing-in-the-world, a
moment in the structure of the Dasein’s mode
of being. The world is something Dasein-ish, It
is not extant like things but it is da, there-here,
like the Dasein, the being-da [das Da-sein]
which we ourselves are: that is to say, it exists.
(BPP 166

“
The world, then, may be seen as a clearing where things can occur
meaningfully. This is also a working definition of human being:
the clearing in the world for meaning. Both definitions direct us
to a distinction, a distinction that hints at the unspoken realm of
world.
World-understanding as Dasein-understanding
is self-understanding. Self and world belong
together in the single entity, the Dasein. Self
and world are not two beings, like subject and
object, or like I and thou, but self and world
are the basic determination of the Dasein itself
in the unity of the structure of [B]eing-in-the-
world. (BPP 297

to let you know that...I just called to say hello.” We just kind of talked. And she told me what
was going on with her. I told her that our wedding was great and that I got back great pictures
from the photographer, that I couldn’t wait to show them to her, that I really love her. She said
to me, well, I said to her that I don’t know how to create a relationship, or how to have a kind
of relationship that works for you. I keep trying to do something and I haven’t been doing any-
thing that’s really worked. “All I’ve done is fi gured out what was wrong with you or what was
wrong with me and try to tell you that, and make you do something diff erent.” And she said
to me, “just be yourself.” You know, it was really remarkable. Because whatever she’s going
through she’s going through. And my father just died and she told me that, you know, she just
shared with me a little bit about that...

She said?

She said: “It’s tough and I don’t know how I’m going to get over it and what I’m going to do.”
And I also saw... My mother and my brothers have been saying to me: “You don’t live in the
same city we do, you can’t have the same kind of relationship we have with each other.” And
I saw that she’s upset that I don’t live where she lives. I’ve never heard it like that before. So
we just had a conversation where there was no sting anymore. There was no more me trying
to get her to do something. It was a conversation where we were actually talking to each other
instead of me trying to get her to do something. And it’s a beginning. And I also said to her that
all I was committed to was that she really, you know, have her life work for her. And I had no
idea what that was going to be and she didn’t either. It was really a beginning, a place to talk
to each other from. And I saw I wasn’t trying to get her to do something. So however I hung
up the phone, I was satisfi ed, and however way I’ve been operating never left me satisfi ed in
talking to her.

Anything else?

One of the things I came to The Forum to get is a way of working with the people I work with
that I don’t live like some special unique human being, but really able to contribute whatever
distinctions are clear to me to them so that they can get done whatever I can get done. And I
can see, who I’d have... I have no idea how to do it and actually live like a possibility for me,
inside my relationship with the people I work with, rather than something I’m supposed to do,
someway I have to be in order to make it. And how I’ve been... when I couldn’t be with some-
thing I didn’t know how to do, or continuing to stand in the face of not knowing how to deliver
on all the work that we’ve got, not knowing how to do that. What I do is I use force instead of
being able to be with whatever’s happening.
