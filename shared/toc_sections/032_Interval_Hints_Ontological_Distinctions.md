SPEAKING BEING
BLAKE (pausing)
It’s really hard for me not to be funny.
ERHARD
Yeah. You’re already always funny.
BLAKE
And I don’t want to be silly or you’re going to get mad at me. It’s just a temptation to always be
funny.
ERHARD
It’s the way you avoid dealing with what you don’t want to deal with, which is being anything
but funny. That’s what you don’t want to deal with. You learned how to deal with being funny.
You got that down very well and the rest of it you’re a little nervous about. But you’re not ner-
vous about being funny, are you?
BLAKE
No.
ERHARD
And you’re not nervous about whatever your racket is either. You’re just nervous about the rest
of it. I know you don’t understand half of what we’re talking about, but that’s all right. Just the
fi rst couple hours.
BLAKE
I don’t want to be nervous anymore.
ERHARD
Somebody write that down for me.
BLAKE
I’m not a dictator and so I have to live with the things I’m not comfortable with, and when I’m
uncomfortable, other people are uncomfortable. I don’t like that.
ERHARD
Thanks... The next subject. Everybody ready for the next subject?
A participant named Charles, who was still concerned with the conversation about the rain, rose.
CHARLES
I’m with “it rains so that life is sustained.”
confidently entrust ourselves to the hidden drift of our
dialogue. . . as long as we remain inquirers” (“DL” in OWL 30,
emphasis added). In true dialogue—which always has an
unspoken ontological intent—the dialogue itself can be trusted to
move us along if we, as participants, continue to be a certain way.
Notice the reflexive nature of the process: simultaneous surrender
and evocation. In The Forum, the maintenance of this delicate
balance is The Forum leader’s task.
A central element of The Forum’s effectiveness is the
inclusiveness of its conversation: interactions between The Forum
leader and those participants who actively engage in the dialogue
are conducted in front of the entire group, so that even those
participants who are listening and observing are able to derive
the benefits of those interactions.
For both Heidegger and Erhard, a shared tendency of human
being underlies all of our diverse individual and cultural concerns.
The assumption of The Forum’s methodology is that a skillfully
managed dialogue between two people can affect the ontological
insight of others who are listening to that dialogue, and who share
the tendency of being that generates it.
A participant whose concern is her relationship with her
employer can recognize, in another participant’s discussion of his
problems with his mother, the same existential structure that is at
the source of her own problem. Thus The Forum leader regularly
exhorts participants to “listen from your own concerns.” ■
Forum Day One: Session One

ERHARD
What we were discussing is this in-order-to. I say the rain has no intention to do anything.
There’s nothing there that could intend. It just rains when it rains. There’s no intention in the
rain. Look, Charles, I’m doing something in the conversation which is designed to allow you to
take a look at your own beliefs. I’m asking questions which reduce your thesis to an absurdity.
If I ask if it rains in order to destroy life, you have to say yes if you believe that it rains in order
to sustain life, and so it makes you reexamine your theory. If you can consider the possibility
that there is no intention in the rainstorm, then you are no longer stuck with what you used to
believe.
CHARLES
I’ll keep looking at it.
ERHARD
We have to go quickly now or there won’t be any fi fth night. There’ll be a twelfth night.
Someone raised a question about why participants were not allowed to take notes in The Forum, a policy
that had been communicated when they registered for the course.
ERHARD
Because we don’t want you to retain information. So you don’t get stuck trying to remember
something. You think Bjorn Borg remembers how to hold the tennis racket? This is no diff erent
than the conversation about the rainstorm.
(loudly)
You have this superstition that you do things because you remember how to do them! You don’t
drive your car, play tennis, or live life powerfully and eff ectively out of anything you remember.
If Joe Montana had to remember how to throw the football when he’s back in the pocket, he’d
get killed every Sunday.
A woman named Doris rose with a question about the rainstorm:
DORIS
What about the role of ultimate being in natural events?
ERHARD
I don’t like to discuss ultimate being with people who don’t know their ass from a hole in the
ground.
DORIS
I fi nd that response pretty off ensive.

SPEAKING BEING
DORIS (stammering slightly)
Are you inferring that I don’t . . .?
ERHARD
No.
(pausing)
We don’t know yet.
DORIS
I assure you I do.
ERHARD
Really? We’ll see. You either do or you don’t, so there’s nothing to be nervous about. Then we
could discuss ultimate being.
(pausing)
I want you to get that I am not a guy in a diner.
He moved toward the back row where Doris was standing:
ERHARD (continuing)
When I was growing up on the east coast, my family took trips to visit people. And we would
drive home, oftentimes very late at night, oftentimes when it was raining or snowing or nasty.
And diners, as far as I knew, were places where you stopped to get a cup of coff ee so you could
stay awake while you were driving. And at my age I couldn’t let anybody do anything without
my being there, so I always had to go in with them. And I learned about guys in diners. Guys in
diners, late at night like I’m describing to you, are usually fairly lonely, because they don’t have
anybody to talk to. And they just love for somebody to stop in because then they’ve got some-
body to talk to. And you know, you go in, and you’re the only person there, and you sit up at the
counter, and you have your cup of coff ee and whatever else. And you fi nd out that this guy in
the  diner—the guy behind the counter—knows everything about everything. There is nothing
about which he does not know. He knows what the president ought to do about the defi cit, he
knows what the country ought to do about international relationships, he knows what you
ought to do about your marriage, he knows what kind of work you ought to do and how what-
ever kind of work you are doing how you could do it better, he knows something about every-
thing. Most people are like a guy in a diner. Goddamned near everybody knows everything
about everything. So in here—at least in The Forum—I question everything. Everything—in-
cluding whether or not you know your ass from a hole in the ground. And whether anyone is
qualifi ed to discuss ultimate being. I didn’t say you weren’t. That’s the way I do The Forum.
(to Doris)
Okay?
Being-in-the-world: Being-in
An important term that Werner Erhard often employs in his work,
and one which is central in the thinking of Martin Heidegger is
Being-in-the-world. To indicate clearly that a human being in his
model of things is not a self-contained Cartesian subject, separate
from an objective world “out there,” Heidegger never presents
Dasein’s Being as disconnected, either from others or from the
world. Dasein’s Being is Being-in-the-world. This indicates “a
unitary phenomenon” which “must be seen as a whole” (
y
BT 78).
T
However, while “Being-in-the-world cannot be broken up into
contents which may be pieced together,” the constituent parts
may be “brought out for emphasis.” One of these parts is Being-in.
