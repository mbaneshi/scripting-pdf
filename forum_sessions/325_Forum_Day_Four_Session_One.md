Forum Day Four: Session One
311
When the fi nal day of The Forum began at 9:00 am, Kipp was at the front of the room. As soon as
participants were seated, Kevin, the man who Erhard accused of being stingy, recommending that
he ask his wife about that, walked up onto the platform and handed a piece of paper to Kipp, who
then read it to the group. It was a signed video release form. The participants stood to applaud at
length.
KIPP
That’s exactly what’s going to be required in your lives, to have something beyond what the
past has given you to happen. What you just saw was an act of something beyond being stingy,
something beyond what the past has given him. And like Kevin, you’re attached. It doesn’t take
much to get you deeply rooted in what you are attached to. I think what just struck a chord for
you was to see someone go beyond what life has given them. That’s what it’s going to take to go
beyond what life has given you: all day every day. That’s the choice you’re going to have.
(to Kevin)
Kevin, I appreciate your courage.
(to the group)
Sharing about the empty and meaninglessness that life is, or the meaning that you made of
empty and meaningless.
MARGARET
The only place where empty and meaningless is meaningful, is where it coincides with my
racket, the only hitch is in there... This morning I called someone I’m engaged to...
KIPP  (interrupting)
That was a quick sentence: “the only place where empty and meaningless means something is
where it coincides with my racket”—that’s the part you got to get. You see, where your racket
is, no one dares to tread.
(laughter; to Margaret)
Yes?
MARGARET
My racket is: “I can’t quite have it... I can’t quite have it all.” It’s a joke. It’s such a joke. But I do
run it with a real verve and panache and other words that go with it. I called a former... well I
was engaged to marry him for a year and a half...
KIPP
So it’s perfect. Someone who “can’t quite have it all” gets engaged for a year and a half...
(laughter)
And not married.

FORUM DAY FOUR:
SESSION ONE

SPEAKING BEING
Being-in-the-World: World
The Forum promises participants a transformed perspective
on their lives, which is to say their Being-in-the-world. Martin
Heidegger hyphenated this phrase in his writing to indicate that
the phenomenon must be seen as a whole, as a unitary structure.
However, he said, its parts could be considered separately for
emphasis. Previously, in Session One of Day One, we examined
Being-in, and in Session One of Day Two, Being-with. Here we
consider Heidegger’s view of world.
Inside/Outside
In the Cartesian model of reality, the model that for the most part
determines the way contemporary human beings understand our
relation to the world, knowledge arises from an encounter between
subject and object: the “I”—the human subject, the being that
knows—encounters and comes to know the objects, and thus the
world.
Martin Heidegger’s model of human being as Dasein
challenges this tradition: Dasein and its world do not correspond
to subject and object (BT 87). Knowledge, in the sense that Dasein
T
knows the world, does not result from a human subject’s coming
to understand an objective world separate from itself.
For Heidegger, the assumptions of the Cartesian model were
problematic. That model presupposes that reality consists of an
“outer” realm (that which becomes known, Nature, the objective
world), and a separate “inner” realm of subjectivity that does the
knowing. This inner realm is in some way distinct from the outer
realm that contains everything else; but it is somehow able to
escape its inner realm so that it can get outside and, well, know.
The problem of inner and outer, and the search for a proof
of the “Dasein of things outside me,” has concerned philosophy
since Descartes. But, says Heidegger, if there is such a problem, it
lies with the question itself.
MARGARET  (continuing to laugh)

...and I shared my racket with him and I said “and furthermore, it’s your racket, too!” It was so
freeing. I mean it was so great to be straight with him. I said “You keep me around. Our sex wasn’t
that great, so you keep me massaging your racket every now and again. You liked that better
than me massaging your penis.” I mean I was able to be so straight with him. “You want me to
massage your case and you didn’t want anything else. And same with me: I have you buy me off
every once and a while. You buy me wonderful gifts. It’s exactly what we’ve always wanted!”
(laughter)
So that was that on that, and I just noticed...
(more laughter)
And he said, “You mean behind that, I don’t really want a relationship?” and I said, “You
should move to California to be with me...”
(laughter)
There was no hook to it anymore. But I run it with everybody, that my life isn’t quite right. I
started dating some great guys about four months ago. Really great guys, but it can’t be that
great. I’m a runner and hurt my leg, and so I’ve gained a little weight, and so now I’ve got that
schtick going: I can’t not have a schtick about things not being quite right. It’s disgusting! You
know, I never have to be responsible for producing at the level of who I am for my job, ever.
Someone can’t stab into me because they know how much I’ve already sacrifi ced.
KIPP
This is an important part because: some of you are successful and the success keeps the wolves
off  your back. The results are part of the racket, and that’s why there’s no satisfaction in them.
The results are there to avoid the domination; they are not results that leave you satisfi ed, no,
they are there to avoid the responsibility of ever really being responsible. “Don’t touch me,
because I’m the best you’ve got.”
MARGARET
Right. It’s horrible. Yeah, and I see the only way to do it is to state that I’m full of it, and “You
can hold me to account, whether I don’t like it, whether I get snarly, hold me to account.” You
know, my life is brilliant, it works, I’ve got the best life there could be. I really do. And yet I run
this racket as good as anyone. Better.
(laughter)
And then I noticed, where are the miracles? Well, this morning I went for a run and it was
eff ortless! I should have been late with all that I did this morning, but I was on time. I stopped
eating last night when I was full. I even made my deep, profound commitment to ending hun-
ger on the planet into an in-order-to, an in-order-to be liked, to make it, and to sacrifi ce: “oh
woe is me.” And that’s ridiculous.
KIPP  (applause as Margaret sits

Thank you very much.
