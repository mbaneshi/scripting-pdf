Forum Day Four: Session One Interval 373
Heidegger is distinguishing a delicate balance—a way of relating to the world
in which we neither impose ourselves upon, nor surrender to and lose ourselves in,
beings. Rather, we withdraw somewhat, so that “they might reveal themselves with
respect to what and how they are,” and so that we might find their truth in the event
of their unconcealment (“OET” in BW 125). In aletheia, Being appears in undistorted
emerging: “Considered in regard to the essence of truth, the essence of freedom
manifests itself as exposure to the disclosedness of beings” (“OET” in BW 126). Ale-
theia, says Heidegger, is “Revealing as the order at the start” (EP 65).
We note here that Werner Erhard has consistently avoided truth claims for his work,
emphasizing repeatedly that he does not know the truth. We propose, however, that
an experience of the truth of Being is a fundamental element of The Forum (see the
first sidebar in the next session, “The Three Levels of Truth”). It is hinted at through-
out the dialogue in the unspoken realm of the conversation, and culminates with
the evocation of the Nothing; but perhaps its most pertinent articulation is Erhard’s
distinction of integrity, which begins with this definition: integrity is “the state of be-
ing whole, complete, unbroken, unimpaired, sound, in perfect condition” (Erhard and
Jensen, “Putting Integrity into Finance: A Purely Positive Approach” 6).
This understanding of integrity is harmonic with phua, the root of the word
physis, which according to Heidegger means “what one originally and authentically
already is: that which essentially unfolds as having been, in contrast to the subse-
quently forced and enforced contrivances and fabrications” (IM 111). In the context
of their fundamental orientation to Being, beings were seen by the pre-Socratics as
originally true, a truth arising in the moment of their free emergence. Distortions of
their truth were subsequent to their unconcealment. This sense of Being as what
one originally and authentically is, we assert, is consistent with Erhard’s under-
standing of integrity, and the distinction of integrity is a fundamental element of the
transformation that The Forum makes available.
Logos: Primal Gathering
Emerging into the truth of unconcealment, physis is gathered in logos. According to
Heidegger, just as the original power of the Greek term physis has been lost, so has
the meaning of logos devolved over time. The traditional academic conception of
this term is that it concerns discourse of some kind—generally reason, assertion, or
logic. In Aristotle’s Rhetoric, for example, logos designated that category of evidence
in which a speaker uses evidence conducive to a given audience’s ability to reason,
making an argument persuasive to that audience.
But these interpretations are later derivations, since the fundamental meaning
of the term for the pre-Socratics had “no immediate relation to language” (IM 137).
Instead, logos, as legein, a form of the verb lego, meant originally to lay, to gather or
collect. Legein is to lay down, to lay before; logos signified the primal gathering principle.
As beings emerged from the sway and into the world, embryonic in their mean-
ing, fragile in their truth, the task to be undertaken was to preserve them in their
unconcealment and in their fundamental orientation to Being: “To be human,” writes
Heidegger, “means to gather, to gather and apprehend the Being of beings” (IM 194).
Naming is not something that follows the event of emergence. Rather, naming, as
originary saying, allows “the Being of beings” to be “opened up in the structure of its
gatheredness… Human beings, as those who stand and act in logos, in gathering, are
the gatherers” (IM 191). How can we think this idea of humans as gatherers? As we
read and listen, we gather letters to make words, gather words to make sentences, and
gather ideas to make sense. As we go through our lives we gather the hours to make a
day, and through time we gather days and years and events to make a life. In so doing,
we order these phenomena—the events of our lives—arranging them in our under-
standing to create narratives, stories filled with meaning, that serve to leave us looking
good and being right. Likewise, for the pre-Socratics, the gathering of logos brought
order to the upsurge of the sway: “Being as logos is originary gathering, not a heap
or a pile where everything counts just as much and just as little—and for this reason,
rank and dominance belong to Being” (IM 147). In logos, phenomena were arrayed as
a world, with differences, limits, and degrees of  importance.
But for the Greeks, there was an element in the gathering that we today have
difficulty comprehending: as “the originally gathering gatheredness that constantly
holds sway in itself,” logos “is constant gathering, the gatheredness of beings that
stands in itself, that is, Being” (IM 141, 145 emphasis added). The Greeks were not
merely gathering beings into the world, but were struggling to do so in a way that
retained each being’s origin: Being, the sway, the background in which it had been
concealed and out of which it had emerged in unconcealment.
Legein for the Greeks gathered the unconcealed into the world as it was
unconcealed. Only in this way can logos as authentic speaking be possible. It is the
letting-be of what is unconcealed in the open region of its unconcealment; and in
distinguishing this fragile phenomenon, Heidegger employs (as he often does) lan-
guaging whose poetic character respects its fragility:

SPEAKING BEING
The saying and talking of mortals comes to pass from early
on as legein, laying. Saying and talking occur essentially as
the letting-lie-together-before of everything which, laid in
unconcealment, comes to presence. (EGT 63)
T
[. . .] Such a letting-lie establishes whatever lies before us as
lying-before. It establishes this as itself., i.e., a letting-lie-before
of what does lie before us, gathered in the selfsameness of its
lying-before [. . .]. This exceptional laying is the legein which
comes to pass as the logos. (EGT 66)
T
This was the challenge for the first philosophers: to bring Being—the realm of
meaninglessness and possibility from which the meanings and possibilities were
made distinct—to stand in the world: “Physis and logos are the same. Logos char-
acterizes Being in a new and yet old respect: that which is in being, which stands
straight and prominently in itself, is gathered in itself and from itself, and holds itself
in such gathering” (IM 145).

SPEAKING BEING
When participants returned from the break at 1 pm, Wes and Kipp were on the platform.
WES (referring to a minor earthquake that happened during the break)
Did you notice that coming from empty and meaningless, an earthquake is just an earthquake?
(some participants raising their hands)
Okay. Wait a second. We’re going to extend an invitation to you that makes sense when you can
come from dwelling in empty and meaningless. We invite you to a campaign, a campaign against
reasonableness. We’re inviting you into a campaign to destroy reasonableness in your life.
(applause)
So we have a question for you so you can confront what the campaign would mean and what
it would look like in your life. Look now at the reasons you have for not participating in life. So
you’re looking through the areas of your life where there has been no participation, and instead
of participation, there have been reasons for not. You have to actually start going through your
life. When you are looking from where we are in The Forum now, you can see things you didn’t
see before. And you’re looking at where there could have been participation, and there wasn’t
and isn’t. And all there is are reasons for not. What new openings are there for participation?
Preston, who spoke at length at the beginning of Session Two of Day Three, stood and took a micro-
phone.
PRESTON
I knew before I got here that I was not going to be allowed to take notes.
KIPP
Right.
PRESTON
This is like: I don’t know of a greater threat to me.
KIPP
An enormous threat.
PRESTON
I’m running my racket, but I’m running it like a coyote through the back roads. And I noticed
on the fi rst day that no one had said, “no notes.” We hadn’t gotten to the promises, so we were
in the pre-promised land, and I’m making my notes. You know, nugget following nugget, which
I can eventually read later when my brain will at least serve me for that because I don’t trust my
brain. So I’m suddenly confronted with the fact that I really haven’t promised that I’ll keep the
promises, but I’ve been keeping them so far because that’s what I’m doing so far.
