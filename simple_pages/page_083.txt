Forum Day One: Session Four

it does is add a dimension. So there’s an exponential leap in the possibility of Being. And that’s 
maybe why there are these outrageous claims people make about what they got from participat-
ing in The Forum.
PARTICIPANT
Couldn’t you add a fourth slice to the pie? Intuition? What you know but don’t know that you 
know.
ERHARD
Yes, that’s very legitimate. You didn’t get the point about dimensionality?
(adding it to the model on the board)
In a point, you have no degrees of freedom. In a line, one dimension, you get one degree of free-
dom, and so on, and we simply expand on that one degree of freedom. The Forum adds a new 
dimension. You get an exponential leap of possibility. 
PARTICIPANT
It’s what you don’t know that you don’t know.
ERHARD
Exactly. 
PARTICIPANT
How do you get there?
ERHARD
You’re in here four days and one evening. You’ll see how it’s done by the end of the third day. 
Anybody else here not get this dimensionality? 
PARTICIPANT
Could you say that what The Forum does is to “unconceal” a new dimension?
ERHARD
Yes, that’s a technical term for it. It’s called unconcealing. What begins to get you into this 
domain of “don’t know that you don’t know” is to dwell in the power of the question. We’re 
hungry for answers, addicted to answers. People hate being in the question; they want the 
answer. You don’t get answers. Light gets shed on what you are concerned with. That’s not the 
way you and I are usually. The way you and I are is hungry for answers. What do I do about it? 
The beginning of gaining access to what you don’t know that you don’t know, the beginning of 
establishing a new dimension for being, a new dimension for living, is to start to dwell in the 
question, develop the courage and the stamina and the wherewithal to orient yourself around 
“ 
Can you formulate a question, the asking 
of which is empowering? So that you’d be 
willing to stay in the question?
