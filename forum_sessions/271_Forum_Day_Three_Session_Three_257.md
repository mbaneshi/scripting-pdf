Forum Day Three: Session Three 257
MOLLY
And then we got to the deeper part of the story. My father told me how much I didn’t
appreciate what he gave me, and my mother said that I abandoned them when I went to
college...
ERHARD
Hold on, I want everyone to get this.
(loudly)
They’ve got a big fucking story too! They got their story. Can you imagine the story my
mother’s got? My mother doesn’t have any story. She could have a story. So. You were noticing
that they have a story.
MOLLY
I’ve been terrifi ed all my life of anger. And I would do anything I can to avoid anger. I do that
with my husband. Standing on this ledge on the phone with them. The anger would pull me
down to the valley. I would become comatose.
ERHARD
Right, you became comatose once to survive being with your parents.
MOLLY
I was comatose.
ERHARD
When you are that it’s empty and meaningless and it’s empty and meaningless that it’s empty
and meaningless, and you can be with another’s story no matter what it is, you’re fearless.
Without fear you don’t have need for courage.
MOLLY
My father’s anger didn’t frighten me for a change. I loved him.
ERHARD
It’s not that you like or endorse his being angry. He’s angry, that’s all. And when you can be
with his anger it disappears. When you got to try to do something to get him from being angry,
or get him to stop being angry, or some other ploy, the anger persists no matter how good the
ploy is. I know this because I talk to your kids. They forgive but they don’t forget, until you can
be with whatever it is that they’re remembering.
MOLLY
I didn’t have to prove anything.
ERHARD
Because it’s horseshit. What is this more or less love, to start with? “You either love me or you don’t”.

SPEAKING BEING
MOLLY
My mother shifted. She talked about how she’d made a lot of mistakes. And how her parents
were diff erent. They weren’t taught how to be with their kids.
ERHARD
You made mistakes raising your children means you made mistakes raising your children, it
doesn’t mean “bad mother,” even though that’s what you got it to mean.
MOLLY
And then she said: “How can we get from here to there?”
ERHARD
Nobody wants to be there. They want to get there. But you can’t get there. You can only be there.
That’s the joke. Nothing is going to make you happy. Nothing. Nothing is going to make you
happy. That happens to be literally true, by the way, but never mind that. You’re going to spend
the rest of your life trying to get what is going to make you happy, except that nothing’s going
to get you happy. You’ve gotta be happy, you can’t get happy. Getting is anathema to happiness.
The pursuit of happiness is the single most eff ective barrier to happiness. Nothing is more
certain to deprive you of happiness than the pursuit of happiness. This is another form of that
answer that there is no answer.
MOLLY
I said to my parents: “Didn’t something shift? We’re here now.” And they laughed. And it was
tender.
ERHARD
That’s really living—that laugh. Is there anything more to complete about this?
MOLLY
After the phone call to my parents, talking to my husband, I remembered an incident when
I was four years old. I was jumping on the couch and I hit the window and cracked open my
forehead. 18 stitches. I was given a washcloth and there was all this blood. We went to the
hospital. In the operating room, all I could see was a huge light, and this disembodied doctor’s
voice told my mother to leave. She left. She went away and left me there. My whole life has been
about that. I’ve been stuck with that abandonment all my life.
ERHARD
Yeah, and stuck with that bright light.
(laughter)
You can’t say anything more important than “that’s what my life has been about ever since.”
That gets you to the source of your whole life. That gets you to zero. All the way back, at
nothing.
Nothing is going to make you happy. Nothing.
Nothing is going to make you happy. That hap-
pens to be literally true, by the way, but never
mind that.
