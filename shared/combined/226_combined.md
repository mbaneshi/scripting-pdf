SPEAKING BEING
When The Forum resumed at 4:30 pm, Kipp was on the platform. Erhard was present, seated on the
platform’s edge. Kipp asked participants to share what they had found out about their lives. A young
man named Tony stood and said that he had sensed “the joke of it all.”
TONY (continuing)
I remembered when I was six my mom took me to Taiwan and once I got off  the plane there
were all these children with missing fi ngers and hands and arms asking for money and I was
terrifi ed. And I saw that everybody is afraid of everybody and that’s what’s wrong with this
world.
KIPP
When you got off  the airplane, what happened at that moment?
TONY
I felt really bad.
ERHARD
The most important thing you said is that it’s all a joke. That’s what we’ve been heading for the
past couple of days. All that stuff  about rackets and being afraid and all that stuff —that’s not
important.
TONY
And I’ve been all afraid that “I’m not going to get what I came to get out of The Forum! I’m not
going to be able to have what I want in my life.”
ERHARD
You want to know what? You’re not!
TONY (laughing)
And now that we got that cleared...
ERHARD
Yeah, well, once everybody gets that cleared we can all go home.
TONY
There really is nothing to get.
ERHARD
That’s right.
TONY (laughing)
What the fuck am I doing in here?
FORUM DAY THREE:
SESSION THREE
Forum Day Three: Session Three 213
ERHARD
Wait. Wait. See you just ruined it.
TONY
I’m just kidding.
ERHARD
You’re like a block and a half ahead of everybody. We’ve got to get everybody caught up to
you. That’s why we got to discuss this now. There when you were a block and a half ahead of
everybody, you made it mean something. “Then why am I here?” Well, where else would you
be if you weren’t here? You’d be some other stupid place. You’re here because you’re here. You
want to start getting what he’s saying. It’s not really a soap opera. It’s really a joke. You know
what a joke is? A joke is when you think the soap opera’s real. That’s a joke. The joke is when
you think you’re going to get someplace. That’s a joke. That’s a joke.
TONY
That’s a fi x.
ERHARD
Exactly. And that thing about “that’s why the world doesn’t work”; no, the world works fi ne.
It works just like this. And the idea that you’re going to make the world work, whatever that
means to you, is another joke. Look around you. That’s the way it is. Just like this.
TONY
But we’ve gotten what the rest of the world hasn’t gotten.
ERHARD
So what? The fucking walls are still the walls. The ceiling is still the ceiling. Life is still the way
it is.
TONY
But by being diff erent...
ERHARD
What do you mean by diff erent?
TONY
By going through what we’ve just been through.
ERHARD
You’re no diff erent.
TONY
Okay.
214
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Listen to me. You are exactly the way you are. You’re not the way you were, you are the way you are.
(interrupting Tony)
Have you ever not been the way you are?
TONY
I think I’ve always been the way I am.
ERHARD
And you want to know what? It’s going to be that way.
TONY
I’m just thinking that we’re more powerful now.
ERHARD
You’re more powerful than you were, so what? You’re as powerful as you are. And you’ve
always been as powerful as you are. That’s part of that illusion, part of the fi x. More powerful.
I’m going to tell you how all this work started for me. I spent my whole life learning how to
make it, or making it. I’m smart, and I worked real hard at it. I studied everything and did
everything. And then one day I was sitting in the car, and I realized I was never going to make
it. I looked back at my life, and it was a joke. I spent thirty-four years of my life climbing a
ladder, got to the top, and found that the ladder didn’t go to the top of the wall. I looked at all
the other ladders and saw that they don’t go over the wall either.
TONY
Why do they have to go up?
ERHARD
That’s the way being human is: climbing ladders that don’t go over the wall. That’s the joke.
That’s what there is to get in here. You are not going to make it. You know what your life is
about? You’re not going to make it. Whatever it’s about. I was real sad when I found that out,
that I wasn’t going to make it. I’d spent thirty-four years trying, thirty-four years of anguish,
thirty-four years of trying to look good. Terrible not to make it. I realized I was never going to be
intelligent enough or good enough, honest enough or contribute enough, anything enough.
TONY
Is it bullshit to think you can make a diff erence?
ERHARD
You make a diff erence if you do, you don’t if you don’t. And if you set up “making a diff erence”
as over the wall, you’ll never get over the wall. You’re making “making a diff erence” the Holy
Grail. No matter what you pick out, if you come through The Forum again three years later
you’ll see it’s a joke. If you make it the Holy Grail, it’ll turn into a fucking joke.
Forum Day Three: Session Three 215
Erhard sat on the edge of the platform as he interacted with Tony, watching him intently.
TONY
Empowering others is what I want to do in life.
ERHARD
And when you do it, you do it, and when you don’t, you don’t. And that’s the whole story.
TONY
I just want to keep doing it.
ERHARD (raising his voice and standing up to approach Tony)
You will if you do and you won’t if you don’t. And if you make it the Holy Grail you’ll make it
into a fucking joke.
TONY (laughing)
Okay...
ERHARD
You get it?
TONY
Okay, so I won’t make it the Holy Grail.
ERHARD (sitting down again)
Yes you will. See, you just turned not making it into another making it. “I won’t make it! That’s
the way I’ll make it, by not making it. That’s my new making it, that’s what’s going to get me
over the wall.”
TONY
I’m not ever thinking about the wall, I just want to do...
ERHARD
So what? You want, so what?
TONY
Okay.
ERHARD
The stars don’t move for “you want.”
216
SPEAKING BEING
TONY
I’m okay with that.
ERHARD
Almost. You’re close to okay with that.
TONY
I just enjoy empowering others, and I discovered this recently...
ERHARD
So what? And you got hair.
TONY
Okay.
ERHARD
But you got it more than you got hair! You got it like some big goddamned thing.
TONY
Yeah I do.
ERHARD
No, it’s a fart.
(laughter)
TONY
Look, I just discovered this for myself.
ERHARD
In about three minutes you’re going to be real deep in this thing. With your foot nailed to the
fl oor about empowering others.
TONY
I discovered that’s what I want to do in life.
ERHARD
So what?
TONY
Okay, so what?
Forum Day Three: Session Three 217
ERHARD
You think I’m saying “so what” like a put-down, but I’m not. I’m just saying “so what.”
Now you’ll do that when you do and you won’t when you don’t. Just like you did before you
discovered that. And then you’ll go on to some other asshole thing. Really. You were in a very
good place when you stood up at fi rst. Stay there for a while. Really. Don’t you understand?
Thirty-four years of trying to make it, I found out I never was going to make it. I got really
clear I was never going to make it. Never going to be anything enough. I found out I was a liar
once. There was a time when my whole life was a lie. But there was a moment when I found
out that everything that came out of my mouth was phony. I decided to stop lying. I almost
didn’t talk for a year, because I couldn’t get anything to come out of my mouth that wasn’t a
lie. “Where’s the toothbrush?” was about as close as I could get. Whatever I said, it was in-
order-to, I was up to something, it was a con someplace at some level. What happened on that
day this work began for me was I realized I was never going to be honest enough to make it. I
was always going to be exactly as honest as I was. I was never going to be less honest or more
honest than that. And if in three days I was going to be more honest, I was more honest, and
if in three days I was going to be less honest, I was less honest. And however honest I was on
that day, that’s how honest I was.
TONY
What you’re talking about is living in the present.
ERHARD
No, not quite. I don’t like that hippie shit. That’s horseshit for me.
TONY
I just got something.
ERHARD
What?
TONY
That my whole life I needed a mission in order to feel great about my life.
ERHARD
See, you’ve never done anything. I realized I knew nothing, because everything I knew, I knew in
order to: I knew nothing as itself. Everything I knew was distorted, had a certain twist to it, a cast
of color. It was never its own color. Everything I knew in-order-to—in order to make the world a
better place, in order to get ahead, in order to look good, in order to get ahead—is all horseshit in your
mouth, because it all has to do with looking good. So there’s nothing ruthless about it Tony. None of
it is itself. The tree is a tree: just a tree. It’s a tree. It’s not “in order to enjoy it.” It’s not “in order to”
anything. It’s a tree, like, a fucking tree. So I was real sad for a long time—about fi ve minutes—
then I started to laugh because I saw the joke of it all: the total joke. Because the realization was,
A chief quality that marks Being and Time as Heidegger’s masterwork
is that while it was written at an early point in his long career, and
although in later years his thinking took some significant turns,
Being and Time has nonetheless retained its stature. We see this as
evidence for the presence of the Same in Heidegger’s thinking over
time—the single thought that lies at the heart of every thinker’s
thinking, and remains always unthought in that thinking (we will
take up “The Same” in the sidebar of that title following “The
Violence of Meaning,” which follows this one).
As a narrative, Being and Time tells the story of Dasein,
which arcs from inauthentic lostness in the “they” to authentic
resoluteness. If, as Hubert Dreyfus suggests, we take Dasein to
stand for human being, then as the being who understands, who
interprets its self, Dasein must have a self that undergoes this
adventure. But the self of Dasein, as Heidegger distinguishes it, is
not the familiar ontic/psychological self—not the accumulation
of experiences and preferences that is generally represented
when one says “I.” Rather: “Dasein’s selfhood has been defined
formally as a way of existing, and therefore not as an entity
present-at-hand” (BT 312). The self of Dasein is not a being, but a
way of Being. If there is no “I” to choose, how is choice, and the
freedom it posits, even possible?
In its current manifestation, the specific way the self of Dasein
occurs for itself is determined by the interests of the “they” (please
see the last sidebar of Day Two Session One). The rules, the tasks,
and the standards have been determined before Dasein was thrown
into the game, to assure the survival of the “they,” and that’s the
way the world is.
But the real issue in this situation is not that Dasein’s choices
are limited; the problem is that they are not yet Dasein’s choices.
218
SPEAKING BEING
“I can’t not in-order-to.” I didn’t invent in-order-to; “Making it” invented me. They had that party
and I got there late. And they said what it is to be a human being, the kind of being a human being
is, is attempting to make it, to look good. That’s what it is to be a human being. And everything
you’re going to do is going to be that. See, you started out this conversation in a great place and there
have been a few changes since then. And when we’re done with this conversation we’re going to be
in a great place and then go through even more changes. ‘Cause you’ll have a new kind of making it.
For some people in this room, “making it” is not making it. They make it by not making it. It’s a trap.
It’s a fucking trap. That’s what it is to be human. The other side of it is, all those balls and chains I
was carrying around for years, they all dropped. You know, I was sad for a while, but then I got the
joke. It’s all a joke. You’re not going to make it. You know what? It isn’t going to work out. It is not
going to work out. You will never meditate enough, or work hard enough, or have your fortune told
enough, or get enough information, or be smart enough, or be holy enough, or practice enough, or
say your prayers enough, or be sexy enough, old enough, young enough, or think enough, or tough
enough to make it. See, some people are trying to survive. That’s also a joke. You’re going to die and
they’re going to stick you in a hole in the ground and throw dirt in your face. It is not going to work
out. That’s how survival is going to work out. You’re going to keep climbing the ladder and keep
climbing the ladder and at the top of the ladder, there’s going to be a hole there, and they’re going to
stick you in there and throw dirt in your face. And that’s how survival is going to work out. It is not
going to work out. It is not going to work out. You are never going to make enough of a diff erence to
make a diff erence. You are always not going to have made a diff erence enough. It isn’t going to turn
out. This is the whole Forum, you might as well get it. The rest is just polish.
Erhard spoke very slowly and deliberately to the group at this point.
ERHARD (continuing)
It is not going to turn out. And you know why it’s not going to turn out? Because it already
turned out. This is how it turned out. Nobody notices that. You made it. This is it. It’s not
gonna turn out. It did turn out. This is the way it turned out. And you fucked it up. You’re still
struggling. What would it mean if you did make a diff erence? So what? You make a diff erence.
Okay fi ne, so what?
TONY
It’s “so what?” because...
ERHARD
No “because.” Don’t fuck it up with “because.” It’s “so what?” because this is what’s so. That’s
why it’s “so what?” It’s just like this. This is how it turned out. You don’t like that, do you? You
didn’t want it to turn out this way. It wasn’t supposed to turn out like this, it was supposed to
turn out some other way. Too bad. This is the way it turned out. It doesn’t care that you don’t
like it.
TONY
There’s still something up for me.
The inauthenticity arises not from the situation, but from Dasein’s
way of being with this situation.
Choosing: Appropriating
And here we encounter one of Heidegger’s most important reversals
of everyday thinking, a move that has been central in Werner Erhard’s
rhetorical technology since its inception.
In our tradition, if one finds oneself stuck in a process generated
by choices one did not make, the action indicated by the situation
is clearly the making of new choices. But consider Heidegger’s
alternative and somewhat tricky perspective:
This process can be reversed only if Dasein
specifically brings itself back to itself from its
lostness in the “they.” But this bringing-back
must have that kind of Being by the neglect of
which Dasein has lost itself in inauthenticity.
(BT 312–313)
“
What has Dasein neglected? It has neglected to choose; therefore, it
must make up for not choosing. But “‘making up’ for not choosing
signifies choosing to make this choice”—that is, choosing to make
the choice not to choose. “In choosing to make this choice, Dasein
makes possible, first and foremost, its authentic potentiality-for-
Being” (BT 313).
ERHARD (continuing)
The “they” has always kept Dasein from taking
hold of these possibilities of Being. The “they”
even hides the manner in which it has tacitly
relieved Dasein of the burden of explicitly
choosing these possibilities. It remains indef-
inite who has “really” done the choosing. So
Dasein makes no choices, gets carried along by
the nobody, and thus ensnares itself in inau-
thenticity. (BT 312)
“
Forum Day Three: Session Three 219
ERHARD
You’re a human being. There’s always going to be something up for you. Your life is always
going to be a soap opera. And it’s always going to be a joke. And every once and a while you’ll
come back to me and get it again.
TONY
I just want to know one thing.
ERHARD
If we get this one thing it’s going to change everything, right? It’s not going to be the way it is,
it’ll be some other way if you get this. If you get this one thing answered, just this one thing.
TONY
Where does God fi t into all this?
ERHARD
Remember I said I didn’t discuss God with people who don’t know their ass from a hole in the
ground.
TONY
Yeah, believe me, there’s a hole in the ground right over there. This is really big for me.
ERHARD
What?
TONY
Having God in my life, and that God makes a diff erence in other people’s lives.
ERHARD
That’s fi ne. Yeah, but you want to make that diff erent than a fart.
TONY
Sure I do.
ERHARD
No, that’s disgusting. If you got God in your life, you’ve got God in your life. That’s all.
TONY
But if you have God in your life then you have purpose in your life.
ERHARD
Really? It’s not going to end with you being put in the ground and dirt being thrown in your
face?
While these passages are from Heidegger’s early work, and the
distinction appropriation became central in his later thinking, we
propose that the unspoken Same can be heard in both cases. This
intensely reflexive movement of thinking, called forth repeatedly
throughout the four days of The Forum and culminating in Session
Two of Day Four, is central to the achievement of its transformational
outcome. It is also deeply embedded in Heidegger’s distinction
appropriation, a term which suggests the taking-ownership of
something that is already at some level one’s own. ■
220
SPEAKING BEING
TONY
It will end that way.
ERHARD
It will. And you want to know what? You’ll be just like you are, whether or not you have God in
your life. I didn’t say there was something wrong with having God in your life. I didn’t say there
was something right with it. You want to turn this “God in my life” stuff  into another fucking
racket. You do. You don’t like that idea.
TONY
If you have the concept of God you have to believe that there’s a better place.
ERHARD
Who said that? The Pope?
TONY
Who the fuck is the Pope?
ERHARD
It’s just you talking. I didn’t say it wasn’t true. I just don’t want you to turn this into another
fucking racket. God is not going to save your ass. Your ass is going into a hole.
TONY
It’s already gone. Great. So if I have God in my life I have God in my life, if I don’t I don’t.
ERHARD
Exactly. That’s the fucking truth isn’t it?
TONY
That is the truth.
ERHARD
Right. You want to make some bullshit out of that.
TONY
Everybody does.
ERHARD
You want to make that mean something. I know everybody does, that’s why I got a job.
(applause)
TONY
Yeah, well, I want your job.
Forum Day Three: Session Three 221
ERHARD
You don’t want my job: I’m a throwaway. You turn God into another racket, another way to
be right and make others wrong, another way to avoid the domination of the responsibility to
be human. They’re going to put your ass in a hole in the ground and throw dirt in your face
and that’s the end of that story. Don’t turn that into more bullshit. And don’t do it because
everybody else does. Tony, you kind of got there early. And it’s important to go through all the
parts of the conversation. We’re going to do that. Stick around. Thanks
TONY
Thank you.
Participants continued to share their experiences from the day.
BETH
When I did the last session, I immediately felt ripped off , because my girlfriend took this last
month. I already knew what was going to happen through the whole thing, and I...
ERHARD
Didn’t make that much of a diff erence, though, knowing what was going to happen, did it?
BETH
Right. And it’s because I didn’t stop myself and a lot of times I stop myself. And so I thought,
“okay, I’m going to do it,” and so I closed my eyes, and I was... stuck. And I thought: “Okay, I
want to get out of this” because I was thinking that this person was supposed to kill me and
the person next to me was going to kill me and that was too far removed from me. And so I
said okay, what other kind of fear do I have? And that kind of fear was the fear of intimacy.
(crying)
And that...
ERHARD
Slow down. Slow down. Go ahead.
BETH
That made me sad. But I felt good about being sad, because I was doing the process and I didn’t
stop myself and I still have the fear of intimacy. And I stop myself a lot of times by not taking
risks.
ERHARD
And you made a soap opera out of it.
(to the group)
And you stopped yourself a lot of times and you don’t take risks and that’s sad and you tried
and you struggled and then you gave up and fi gured the hell with it, and tried to be something
222
SPEAKING BEING
else instead of trying to be intimate and then you found out that that was no good, and so then
you went back to try to be intimate, and nah nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah nah,
nah nah, nah nah nah nah nah.
BETH
Right.
ERHARD (to the group)
Now I’m talking about you, not her. She just happens to be standing up so we got some way to
talk to you. You don’t want to listen to her soap opera. You want to listen to your soap opera,
your “what happened,” and the sad, and the struggle, the eff ort, and the sacrifi ce that you have
made, nah nah nah nah nah nah nah. Great, go on, you’re doing a good job.
(Beth remains silent)
What does that mean that you avoid intimacy? I don’t want to put words in your mouth if that’s
not the way you said it. Say it the way you said it. What does it mean?
BETH
That... I’m talking about a personal relationship...
ERHARD
I’m not asking you to explain it, I’m asking what it means. So what?
BETH
So what?
ERHARD
Yeah, so what? I asked you fi rst.
BETH
You mean, what do I do?
ERHARD
No, so what?
BETH
Yeah.
ERHARD
I mean, so what?
BETH
I avoid intimacy.
ERHARD (continuing)

هنگامی که این مجمع ساعت 4:30 بعد از ظهر از سر گرفت ، کیپ روی سکو بود. erhard حضور داشت ، در آن نشسته بود
لبه سکو کیپ از شرکت کنندگان خواست تا آنچه را که در مورد زندگی خود پیدا کرده بودند به اشتراک بگذارند. یک جوان
مردی به نام تونی ایستاد و گفت که "شوخی همه آن" را حس کرده است.
تونی (ادامه)
یادم آمد وقتی شش ساله بودم مادرم مرا به تایوان برد و یک بار که از آنجا پیاده شدم
آیا همه این کودکان با دست و دست و دست و دست و دست و دست و دست و دستمزد و من پول می خواستند و من بودم
Terrifi ed. و من دیدم که همه از همه می ترسند و این چه اشتباهی در این مورد است
جهان کله
وقتی از هواپیما پیاده شدید ، در آن لحظه چه اتفاقی افتاد؟ تونی
احساس بدی کردم درز
مهمترین چیزی که شما گفتید این است که این همه شوخی است. این همان چیزی است که ما به دنبال آن هستیم
چند روز گذشته همه چیز در مورد راکت ها و ترسیدن و همه چیزها - اینطور نیست
مهم تونی
و من همه می ترسم که "من نمی خواهم آنچه را که برای خارج شدن از انجمن به دست آورده ام دریافت کنم! من نیستم
می توانم آنچه را که در زندگی ام می خواهم داشته باشم. "
درز
شما می خواهید بدانید چه؟ شما نیستید! تونی (خنده)
و حالا که ما آن را پاک کردیم ... erhard
بله ، خوب ، هنگامی که همه از آن پاک شدند ، همه ما می توانیم به خانه برویم. تونی
واقعاً چیزی برای بدست آوردن وجود ندارد. درز
درست است تونی (خنده)
من اینجا چه کار می کنم؟ روز اول انجمن:
جلسه سه
روز اول انجمن: جلسه سه 213
درز
صبر کن صبر کن می بینید که فقط آن را خراب کرده اید. تونی
من فقط شوخی می کنم درز
شما مانند یک بلوک و نیم جلوتر از همه هستید. ما باید همه را گرفتار کنیم
شما به همین دلیل اکنون باید در مورد این موضوع بحث کنیم. آنجا که شما یک بلوک و نیم جلوتر بودید
همه ، شما آن را به معنای چیزی ساختید. "پس چرا من اینجا هستم؟" خوب ، کجا دیگر
اگر اینجا نبودید؟ شما مکان احمقانه دیگری خواهید بود. شما اینجا هستید زیرا اینجا هستید. شما
می خواهم آنچه را که او می گوید شروع کنم. این واقعاً یک اپرا صابون نیست. این واقعاً یک شوخی است شما می دانید
شوخی چیست؟ شوخی است وقتی فکر می کنید واقعی اپرا صابون است. این یک شوخی است شوخی وقتی است
شما فکر می کنید می خواهید به جایی برسید. این یک شوخی است این یک شوخی است تونی
این یک fi x است. درز
دقیقاً و این موضوع در مورد "به همین دلیل جهان کار نمی کند" ؛ نه ، جهان کار می کند. درست مثل این کار می کند. و این ایده که شما می خواهید جهان را کار کنید ، هر چه باشد
به معنای شما ، یک شوخی دیگر است. به اطراف خود نگاه کنید این همان است که هست درست مثل این تونی
اما ما آنچه را که بقیه جهان به دست نیاوردیم بدست آورده ایم. درز
پس چی؟ دیوارهای لعنتی هنوز دیوارها هستند. سقف هنوز سقف است. زندگی هنوز راه است
این است تونی
اما با اختلاف نظر ... erhard
منظورتان از تفاوت چیست؟ تونی
با گذراندن آنچه که ما فقط از آن عبور کرده ایم. درز
شما تفاوت چندانی ندارید تونی
خوب 214
وجود
درز
به من گوش کن شما دقیقاً همان روشی هستید که هستید. شما به شکلی که هستید نیستید ، شما همانطور که هستید هستید. (قطع تونی)
آیا تا به حال به شکلی که هستید نبوده اید؟ تونی
من فکر می کنم من همیشه همانطور که هستم بوده ام. درز
و شما می خواهید بدانید که چیست؟ این به همین ترتیب خواهد بود تونی
من فقط فکر می کنم که اکنون قدرتمندتر هستیم. درز
شما قدرتمندتر از خود هستید ، پس چه؟ شما به اندازه خود قدرتمند هستید. و شما
همیشه به اندازه شما قدرتمند بوده اید. این بخشی از این توهم است ، بخشی از fi x. قدرتمندتر من می خواهم به شما بگویم که چگونه این همه کار برای من آغاز شد. من تمام زندگی ام را صرف یادگیری نحوه
آن را درست کنید ، یا آن را درست کنید. من باهوش هستم ، و من در آن واقعاً سخت کار کردم. من همه چیز را مطالعه کردم و انجام دادم
همه چیز و بعد یک روز من در ماشین نشسته بودم و فهمیدم که هرگز نمی خواهم بسازم
آن به زندگی ام نگاه کردم و این یک شوخی بود. من سی و چهار سال از زندگی ام را صرف بالا کردم
نردبان ، به بالا رسید و فهمید که نردبان به بالای دیوار نمی رود. به همه نگاه کردم
نردبان های دیگر و دیدند که آنها نیز از روی دیوار نمی روند. تونی
چرا آنها باید بالا بروند؟ درز
این روشی است که انسان است: صعود نردبان هایی که از روی دیوار نمی روند. این شوخی است این چیزی است که برای ورود به اینجا وجود دارد. شما نمی خواهید آن را بسازید. شما می دانید زندگی شما چیست
در مورد؟ شما نمی خواهید آن را بسازید. هرچه در مورد آن باشد من وقتی متوجه شدم که این موضوع را ناراحت کردم ،
که من نمی خواهم آن را بسازم. من سی و چهار سال را صرف تلاش ، سی و چهار سال درد و رنج کردم ،
سی و چهار سال تلاش برای نگاه خوب. وحشتناک نیست که آن را بسازید. فهمیدم که هرگز قرار نیست باشم
به اندازه کافی هوشمند یا به اندازه کافی خوب ، به اندازه کافی صادقانه یا به اندازه کافی کمک کنید ، به اندازه کافی. تونی
آیا فکر می کنید می توانید تفاوت زیادی ایجاد کنید؟ درز
اگر این کار را نکنید ، اگر این کار را نکنید ، تفاوت زیادی ایجاد می کنید. و اگر "ساخت یک تفاوت" را تنظیم کرده اید
مانند دیوار ، هرگز از دیوار عبور نخواهید کرد. شما در حال ساختن "ساختار متفاوت" مقدس هستید
گریل مهم نیست که چه چیزی را انتخاب می کنید ، اگر سه سال بعد دوباره از طریق انجمن وارد شوید
خواهید دید که این یک شوخی است. اگر آن را به عنوان مقدس مقدس تبدیل کنید ، به یک شوخی لعنتی تبدیل می شود. روز اول انجمن: جلسه سه 215
ارهارد در حالی که با تونی در تعامل بود ، روی لبه سکو نشست و با دقت او را تماشا می کرد. تونی
توانمندسازی دیگران همان کاری است که من می خواهم در زندگی انجام دهم. درز
و هنگامی که این کار را انجام می دهید ، این کار را می کنید ، و وقتی این کار را نمی کنید ، این کار را نمی کنید. و این کل داستان است تونی
من فقط می خواهم این کار را ادامه دهم. erhard (بلند کردن صدای او و ایستادن برای نزدیک شدن به تونی)
اگر این کار را انجام دهید و اگر این کار را نکنید ، نخواهید بود. و اگر آن را به عنوان مقدس مقدس درست کنید ، آن را درست خواهید کرد
به یک شوخی لعنتی. تونی (خنده)
خوب ... erhard
شما آن را دریافت می کنید؟ تونی
خوب ، بنابراین من آن را به عنوان مقدس مقدس نمی سازم. erhard (دوباره نشسته)
بله شما خواهید کرد. ببینید ، شما فقط تبدیل به آن نشده اید که آن را به دیگری تبدیل کنید. "من آن را نمی سازم!
راهی که من آن را درست می کنم ، با درست کردن آن. این ساخت جدید من است ، این چیزی است که من را به خود جلب می کند
بالای دیوار. "
تونی
من هرگز به دیوار فکر نمی کنم ، فقط می خواهم انجام دهم ... erhard
پس چی؟ شما می خواهید ، پس چه؟ تونی
خوب درز
ستاره ها برای "شما می خواهید" حرکت نمی کنند.

وجود
تونی
من با آن خوبم درز
تقریبا. شما با این کار نزدیک هستید. تونی
من فقط از توانمندسازی دیگران لذت می برم و اخیراً این را کشف کردم ... erhard
پس چی؟ و شما مو دارید. تونی
خوب درز
اما شما آن را بیشتر از موهای خود گرفتید! شما آن را مانند یک چیز بزرگ خدای بزرگ بدست آورده اید. تونی
بله من درز
نه ، این یک گوز است. (خنده)
تونی
ببین ، من فقط این را برای خودم کشف کردم. درز
در حدود سه دقیقه ، شما در این مورد در اعماق واقعاً واقعاً خواهید بود. با پای خود را به
در مورد توانمندسازی دیگران. تونی
من فهمیدم این همان کاری است که می خواهم در زندگی انجام دهم. درز
پس چی؟ تونی
خوب ، پس چی؟ روز اول انجمن: جلسه سه 217
درز
شما فکر می کنید من می گویم "پس چه" مانند یک فروپاشی ، اما من نیستم. من فقط می گویم "پس چه."
اکنون وقتی این کار را انجام می دهید این کار را انجام می دهید و وقتی این کار را نمی کنید. درست مثل قبل از خود
کشف کرد که و سپس به برخی موارد دیگر Asshole بروید. واقعاً شما در یک خیلی بود
مکان خوبی وقتی در اولین بار ایستادید. مدتی در آنجا بمانید. واقعاً نمی فهمید؟ سی و چهار سال از تلاش برای ساختن آن ، فهمیدم که هرگز نمی خواهم آن را بسازم. من واقعاً گرفتم
واضح است که من هرگز قصد ساخت آن را نداشتم. هرگز چیزی کافی نخواهد بود. فهمیدم دروغگو هستم
یک بار زمانی بود که کل زندگی من دروغ بود. اما لحظه ای بود که پیدا کردم
بیرون از آنچه که از دهان من بیرون آمد ، دلخراش بود. من تصمیم گرفتم که از دروغ گفتن دست بردارم. من تقریبا
یک سال صحبت نکردم ، زیرا من نتوانستم چیزی از دهانم بیرون بیایم که نبود
دروغ "مسواک کجاست؟" تقریباً به همان اندازه نزدیک بود که می توانستم بدست آورم. هرچه گفتم ،
سفارش ، من به چیزی توجه داشتم ، در جایی در جایی بود. چه اتفاقی در آن افتاد
روزی که این کار برای من آغاز شد این بود که فهمیدم که هرگز نمی خواهم به اندازه کافی صادق باشم که آن را بسازم. من
همیشه دقیقاً به اندازه من صادقانه بود. من هرگز نمی خواستم کمتر صادقانه یا بیشتر باشم
صادقانه از این و اگر در سه روز صادقانه تر می شدم ، صادقانه تر بودم و
اگر در سه روز کمتر صادقانه بگویم ، کمتر صادقانه بودم. و هرچند صادقانه بودم
آن روز ، من چقدر صادق بودم. تونی
آنچه در مورد آن صحبت می کنید زندگی در حال حاضر است. درز
نه ، نه کاملاً. من آن گه هیپی را دوست ندارم. این نعل اسب برای من است. تونی
من فقط چیزی گرفتم درز
چی؟ تونی
که تمام زندگی من به یک مأموریت نیاز داشتم تا احساس خوبی نسبت به زندگی خود داشته باشم. درز
ببینید ، شما هرگز کاری نکرده اید. فهمیدم که هیچ چیز نمی دانم ، زیرا هر آنچه را می دانستم ، می دانستم
سفارش: من هیچ چیز را به عنوان خود نمی دانستم. هرچه می دانستم تحریف شده است ، پیچش خاصی به آن داشت ، بازیگران
از رنگ این هرگز رنگ خودش نبود. هر آنچه را که می دانستم به ترتیب-به منظور ساختن جهان
مکان بهتر ، برای پیشبرد ، برای اینکه به نظر خوب برسد ، برای پیشروی
دهان ، زیرا همه اینها با خوب به نظر می رسد. بنابراین هیچ چیز بی رحمانه ای در مورد آن وجود ندارد. هیچ یک از
خودش است درخت یک درخت است: فقط یک درخت. این یک درخت است این "برای لذت بردن از آن" نیست. این "به منظور" نیست
هر چیزی این یک درخت است ، مانند یک درخت لعنتی. بنابراین من برای مدت طولانی واقعاً ناراحت بودم - در مورد دقایقی -
سپس من شروع به خندیدن کردم زیرا شوخی همه را دیدم: کل شوخی. زیرا تحقق بود ،
کیفیت اصلی که به عنوان کارشناسی ارشد هایدگر وجود دارد و زمان آن را نشان می دهد
این است که در حالی که در یک نقطه اولیه در حرفه طولانی خود نوشته شده بود ، و
اگرچه در سالهای بعد ، تفکر او چرخش قابل توجهی داشت ،
با این وجود زمان بودن و زمان ، قد و قامت خود را حفظ کرده است. ما این را می بینیم
شواهدی برای وجود همان در تفکر هایدگر
زمان - فکر مجرد که در قلب هر متفکر نهفته است
فکر کردن ، و همیشه در این تفکر بی فکر است (ما چنین خواهیم کرد
"همان" را در نوار کناری آن عنوان به دنبال "The" بگیرید
خشونت معنا ، "که این را دنبال می کند). به عنوان یک روایت ، وجود و زمان داستان داسین را روایت می کند ،
کدام قوس از دست دادن غیرقانونی در "آنها" تا معتبر است
قاطعیت اگر ، همانطور که هوبرت دریفوس پیشنهاد می کند ، ما داسین را به آن می بریم
برای انسان بایستید ، سپس به عنوان موجودی که می فهمد ، چه کسی
خود خود را تفسیر می کند ، Dasein باید خود را داشته باشد که تحت این کار قرار بگیرد
ماجراجویی اما خود Dasein ، همانطور که هایدگر آن را متمایز می کند ،
نه خود آشنا و روانی - نه تجمع
از تجربیات و ترجیحات که به طور کلی نشان داده شده است
وقتی کسی می گوید "من" در عوض: "خودخواهی Dasein تعریف شده است
به طور رسمی به عنوان روشی برای موجود است ، و بنابراین به عنوان یک موجودیت نیست
در حال حاضر دست "(BT 312). خود Dasein یک موجود نیست ، بلکه یک است
روش بودن اگر "من" برای انتخاب وجود نداشته باشد ، چگونه انتخاب و
آزادی آن حتی ممکن است؟ در تظاهرات فعلی خود ، روش خاص خود Dasein
برای خودش اتفاق می افتد با منافع "آنها" (لطفا
آخرین نوار کناری روز دو جلسه را ببینید). قوانین ، وظایف ،
و استانداردها قبل از پرتاب داسین تعیین شده است
به بازی ، برای اطمینان از بقای "آنها" ، و این
راه جهان است. اما مسئله واقعی در این شرایط این نیست که انتخاب های Dasein
محدود هستند مشکل این است که آنها هنوز گزینه های Dasein نیستند. 218

"من نمی توانم به صورت سفارش دهم." من به صورت سفارش اختراع نکردم. "ساختن آن" مرا اختراع کرد. آنها آن مهمانی را داشتند
و من دیر به آنجا رسیدم. و آنها گفتند که یک انسان بودن چیست ، نوع انسان بودن
در تلاش است تا آن را خوب جلوه دهد. این همان چیزی است که یک انسان است. و همه چیز
شما قصد انجام این کار را دارید. ببینید ، شما این مکالمه را در یک مکان عالی و آنجا شروع کردید
از آن زمان تاکنون چند تغییر بوده است. و هنگامی که ما با این مکالمه انجام شدیم ، خواهیم بود
در یک مکان عالی و سپس تغییرات بیشتری را انجام دهید. ‘زیرا شما نوع جدیدی از ساخت آن را خواهید داشت. برای برخی از افراد در این اتاق ، "ساختن آن" آن را ایجاد نمی کند. آنها با درست کردن آن ، آن را درست می کنند. این یک تله است این یک تله لعنتی است. این همان چیزی است که انسان بودن است. طرف دیگر آن ، تمام آن توپ ها و زنجیرها من است
سالها بود که همه آنها را حمل می کردند ، همه آنها افتادند. می دانید ، من مدتی ناراحت شدم ، اما بعد
شوخی این همه شوخی است شما نمی خواهید آن را بسازید. شما می دانید چه؟ این کار نمی کند. نیست
رفتن به کار شما هرگز به اندازه کافی مراقبه نخواهید کرد ، یا به اندازه کافی سخت کار نخواهید کرد ، یا ثروت خود را گفته اید
به اندازه کافی ، یا اطلاعات کافی کسب کنید ، یا به اندازه کافی باهوش باشید ، یا به اندازه کافی مقدس باشید ، یا به اندازه کافی تمرین کنید ، یا
دعاهای خود را به اندازه کافی بگویید ، یا به اندازه کافی سکسی باشید ، به اندازه کافی پیر ، به اندازه کافی جوان ، یا به اندازه کافی فکر کنید ، یا سخت است
برای ساختن آن کافی است. ببینید ، برخی از افراد در تلاش برای زنده ماندن هستند. این یک شوخی است شما می خواهید بمیرید و
آنها می خواهند شما را در یک سوراخ در زمین بچسبانند و خاک را در صورت شما پرتاب کنند. قرار نیست کار کند
بیرون اینگونه است که بقا به نتیجه می رسد. شما می خواهید از نردبان بالا بروید و نگه دارید
صعود از نردبان و در بالای نردبان ، سوراخی در آنجا وجود خواهد داشت ، و آنها قصد دارند
شما را به آنجا بچسبانید و خاک را در صورت خود پرتاب کنید. و اینگونه است که بقا به نتیجه می رسد. نیست
رفتن به کار قرار نیست کار کند. شما هرگز نمی خواهید به اندازه کافی از تفاوت استفاده کنید
تفاوت ایجاد کنید. شما همیشه نمی خواهید به اندازه کافی تفاوت ایجاد کنید. قرار نیست به نوبه خود
بیرون این کل انجمن است ، شما نیز ممکن است آن را بدست آورید. بقیه فقط لهستانی است. ارهارد در این مرحله بسیار آهسته و عمدی با گروه صحبت کرد. erhard (ادامه)
قرار نیست معلوم شود. و می دانید که چرا این کار نمی شود؟ چون قبلاً
معلوم شد اینگونه معلوم شد. هیچ کس متوجه این موضوع نمی شود. تو درست کردی این است این نیست
معلوم می شود معلوم شد این روشی است که معلوم شد. و شما آن را لعنتی. شما هنوز هستید
تلاش اگر شما یک تفاوت ایجاد کنید ، چه معنایی دارد؟ پس چی؟ شما یک تفاوت متفاوت ایجاد می کنید. باشه فی ، پس چی؟ تونی
این "پس چه؟" چون ... erhard
نه "زیرا". آن را با "زیرا" لعنتی نکنید. این "پس چه؟" زیرا این همان چیزی است که چنین است. یعنی
چرا "پس چه؟" این دقیقاً مثل این است اینگونه معلوم شد. شما آن را دوست ندارید ، آیا؟ شما
نمی خواستم این راه را به این نتیجه برساند. قرار نبود مانند این معلوم شود ، قرار بود
به روش دیگری معلوم شوید. خیلی بد این روشی است که معلوم شد. اهمیتی نمی دهد که شما این کار را نمی کنید
مثل آن تونی
هنوز چیزی برای من وجود دارد. عدم اعتماد به نفس نه از وضعیت ، بلکه از Dasein ناشی می شود
روش بودن با این وضعیت. انتخاب: اختصاص
و در اینجا با یکی از مهمترین وارونهای هایدگر روبرو می شویم
از تفکر روزمره ، حرکتی که در ورنر ارهارد محوری بوده است
فناوری بلاغی از زمان آغاز آن. در سنت ما ، اگر کسی خود را در یک فرآیند تولید شده گیر کند
با انتخاب هایی که انجام نداد ، اقدامی که توسط اوضاع نشان داده شده است
به وضوح انجام انتخاب های جدید است. اما هایدگر را در نظر بگیرید
دیدگاه جایگزین و تا حدودی مشکل:
این فرایند فقط در صورت دزین قابل برگشت است
به طور خاص خود را از خود به خود باز می گرداند
از دست دادن در "آنها". اما این بازگشت
باید با غفلت از این نوع وجود داشته باشد
که داسین خود را در عدم اعتماد به نفس از دست داده است. (BT 312-313)
"
دسین از چه چیزی غفلت کرده است؟ از انتخاب غفلت کرده است. بنابراین ، آن
برای انتخاب نکردن باید جبران شود. اما "" تشکیل "برای انتخاب نکردن
انتخاب این انتخاب را نشان می دهد. "
انتخاب انتخابی. "در انتخاب این انتخاب ، داسین
اول و مهمتر از همه ، پتانسیل معتبر آن را ممکن می سازد
بودن "(bt 313). erhard (ادامه)
"آنها" همیشه دزین را از گرفتن نگه داشته است
از این امکانات بودن استفاده کنید. "آنها"
حتی شیوه ای را که به طور ضمنی دارد پنهان می کند
دزین تسکین یافته بار صریح
انتخاب این امکانات. باقی مانده است-
Inite که "واقعاً" را انتخاب کرده است. اینقدر
Dasein هیچ انتخابی نمی کند ، توسط
هیچ کس ، و بدین ترتیب خود را در اینهه قرار می دهد
سمیت (BT 312)

شما یک انسان هستید همیشه چیزی برای شما وجود خواهد داشت. زندگی شما همیشه است
رفتن به یک اپرا صابون. و همیشه یک شوخی خواهد بود. و هر چند وقت یکبار
به من برگردید و دوباره آن را دریافت کنید. تونی
من فقط می خواهم یک چیز را بدانم. درز
اگر این یک چیز را بدست آوریم ، همه چیز را تغییر می دهد ، درست است؟ این به شکلی که هست نخواهد بود ،
اگر این کار را بدست آورید ، این روش دیگری خواهد بود. اگر این یک چیز را پاسخ دهید ، فقط این یک چیز است. تونی
خدا از کجا به همه اینها می پردازد؟ درز
به یاد داشته باشید من گفتم که من با افرادی که الاغ خود را از یک سوراخ در آن نمی شناسند ، در مورد خدا بحث نکردم
زمین تونی
بله ، باور کنید ، یک سوراخ در زمین وجود دارد. این برای من واقعاً بزرگ است. درز
چی؟ تونی
داشتن خدا در زندگی من ، و اینکه خدا در زندگی دیگران تفاوت ایجاد می کند. درز
این fi ne است بله ، اما شما می خواهید این تفاوت را از یک گوز متفاوت کنید. تونی
مطمئناً من انجام می دهم درز
نه ، این منزجر کننده است اگر خدا را در زندگی خود گرفتید ، خدا را در زندگی خود قرار داده اید. این همه است تونی
اما اگر خدا را در زندگی خود دارید ، در زندگی خود هدف دارید. درز
واقعاً؟ این به پایان نمی رسد که شما را در زمین قرار دهید و خاک در شما پرتاب شود
صورت؟ در حالی که این معابر از کار اولیه هایدگر و
تخصیص تمایز در تفکر بعدی او ، ما محوری شد
پیشنهاد کنید که در هر دو مورد نیز همین حرف را می توان شنید. این
حرکات بسیار بازتابنده تفکر ، که به طور مکرر از آن خوانده می شود
در طول چهار روز از انجمن و اوج در جلسه
دو روز چهارم ، برای دستیابی به تحول آن مهم است
نتیجه همچنین عمیقاً در تمایز هایدگر تعبیه شده است

این به این ترتیب پایان خواهد یافت. درز
خواهد شد و شما می خواهید بدانید که چیست؟ شما دقیقاً مثل خود خواهید بود ، خواه خدا را در آن داشته باشید یا نه
زندگی شما من نگفتم که داشتن خدا در زندگی شما مشکلی وجود دارد. من آنجا نگفتم
چیزی درست با آن بود شما می خواهید این چیزهای "خدا را در زندگی من" را به یک لعنتی دیگر تبدیل کنید
راکت شما انجام می دهید شما این ایده را دوست ندارید. تونی
اگر مفهوم خدا را دارید ، باید باور کنید که مکان بهتری وجود دارد. درز
چه کسی این را گفت؟ پاپ؟ تونی
پاپ کیست؟ درز
این فقط شما صحبت می کنید من نگفتم که این درست نیست. من فقط نمی خواهم این را به دیگری تبدیل کنید
راکت لعنتی. خدا قصد نجات الاغ شما را ندارد. الاغ شما به یک سوراخ می رود. تونی
قبلاً از بین رفته است عالی بنابراین اگر من در زندگی خود خدا دارم ، من در زندگی خود خدا را دارم ، اگر من اینطور نیست. درز
دقیقاً این حقیقت لعنتی نیست؟ تونی
این حقیقت است. درز
درست شما می خواهید مقداری گلوله ای از آن بسازید. تونی
همه این کار را می کنند. درز
شما می خواهید این معنی را ایجاد کنید. من می دانم که همه این کار را می کنند ، به همین دلیل من کار کردم. (تشویق)
تونی
بله ، خوب ، من کار شما را می خواهم. روز اول انجمن: جلسه سه 221
درز
شما کار من را نمی خواهید: من یک پرتاب هستم. شما خدا را به راکت دیگری تبدیل می کنید ، راه دیگری برای
درست باشید و دیگران را اشتباه کنید ، راه دیگری برای جلوگیری از تسلط بر مسئولیت
انسان باشید آنها می خواهند الاغ شما را در یک سوراخ در زمین قرار دهند و خاک را در صورت شما پرتاب کنند
و این پایان آن داستان است. این را به گلوله تر تبدیل نکنید. و این کار را نکنید زیرا
همه افراد دیگر این کار را می کنند. تونی ، شما زودتر به آنجا رسیدید. و مهم است که همه
بخش هایی از مکالمه ما می خواهیم این کار را انجام دهیم. دور هم بچسب با تشکر
تونی
ممنون شرکت کنندگان همچنان تجربیات خود را از روز به اشتراک گذاشتند. بیت
وقتی آخرین جلسه را انجام دادم ، بلافاصله احساس پاره شدن کردم ، زیرا دوست دخترم آخرین بار را گرفت
ماه من قبلاً می دانستم که چه اتفاقی می افتد در کل چیز ، و من ... erhard
آیا با دانستن اینکه چه اتفاقی خواهد افتاد ، این مسئله را از بین نبرد؟ بیت
درست و به این دلیل است که من خودم را متوقف نکردم و بارها خودم را متوقف می کنم. و بنابراین من فکر کردم ،
"خوب ، من می خواهم این کار را انجام دهم" ، و بنابراین چشمانم را بستم ، و من گیر کردم. و من فکر کردم: "باشه ، من
می خواهم از این خارج شوم "زیرا من فکر می کردم که این شخص قرار است مرا بکشد و
شخصی که در کنار من بود قصد داشت مرا بکشد و این خیلی دور از من بود. و بنابراین من
گفت خوب ، چه نوع ترس دیگری دارم؟ و این نوع ترس ترس از صمیمیت بود. (گریه)
و آن ... erhard
کند شدن کند شدن برو جلو بیت
این باعث ناراحتی من شد. اما من از غم و اندوه احساس خوبی کردم ، زیرا من این روند را انجام می دادم و این کار را نکردم
خودم را متوقف کنید و من هنوز ترس از صمیمیت را داریم. و من بارها و بارها خودم را متوقف می کنم
خطرات درز
و شما یک اپرا صابون از آن درست کردید. (به گروه)
و بارها خود را متوقف کرده اید و خطرات نمی کنید و این غم انگیز است و سعی کردید
و شما تلاش کردید و بعد تسلیم شدید و جهنم را با آن گرفت و سعی کرد چیزی باشد

دیگری به جای اینکه سعی کنید صمیمی باشید و بعد فهمیدید که این خوب نیست ، و پس از آن
شما دوباره بازگشتید تا سعی کنید صمیمی باشید ، و نه نه نه نه نه ، نه نه ، نه نه نه ،
نه نه ، نه نه نه نه. بیت
درست erhard (به گروه)
اکنون من در مورد شما صحبت می کنم ، نه او. او فقط اتفاق می افتد که ایستاده است ، بنابراین ما راهی به آن رسیدیم
با شما صحبت کنید شما نمی خواهید به اپرا صابون او گوش دهید. شما می خواهید به اپرا صابون خود گوش دهید ،
"چه اتفاقی افتاده است" ، و غمگین ، و مبارزه ، out ort و قربانی که شما دارید
ساخته شده ، نه نه نه نه نه ناح. عالی ، ادامه دهید ، شما کار خوبی انجام می دهید. (بث ساکت است)
این بدان معنی است که شما از صمیمیت خودداری می کنید؟ من نمی خواهم کلمات را در دهان شما بگذارم اگر این باشد
نه راهی که شما آن را گفتید. آن را به روشی که گفتید بگویید. معنی آن چیست؟ بیت
که ... من در مورد یک رابطه شخصی صحبت می کنم ... erhard
من از شما نمی خواهم که آن را توضیح دهید ، می پرسم معنی آن چیست. پس چی؟ بیت
پس چی؟ درز
بله ، پس چی؟ من از شما پرسیدم اولین بار. بیت
منظورت این است که چه کاری انجام دهم؟ درز
