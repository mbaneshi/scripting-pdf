Nine years, yes.

So Nicole. “My thesis not getting done” does not occur like: “It’s a problem, my thesis isn’t 
getting done.” Right?
NICOLE
Right.
WES
Yeah. It occurs some way. How does it occur?
NICOLE
Through being stuck.
WES
No, you just explained it. Not bad. But explained it. I want the occurrence. What’s your relation-
ship to the thesis not getting done? Talk to me about it. Tell me... what goes on with you about 
it?
NICOLE
Oh I use a lot of reasons.
WES
Right. You’ve got reasons. And lying. What else?
NICOLE
And disbelief.
WES
And why is that going on with you? Why do you have to give all those reasons for it and lies
about it and disbeliefs about it?
NICOLE
So it won’t get done.
WES
No.
NICOLE
Ask the question again?
