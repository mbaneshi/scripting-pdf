Forum Day Four: Session One
347
ERHARD
It’s all clear now, isn’t it? It’s all clear now. Absolutely. That cleared it all up, now didn’t it? Go 
on Wes.
(after much laughter, Wes continues to read several defi nitions of “life”)
It’s all clear now isn’t it?
DENNIS
No it’s not...
ERHARD
Listen up. You’ve got a hidden standard for getting it. Did you hear what I said? You’ve got a 
hidden standard for getting it. It’s kind of like, when I hear the angels trumpet then I’ll know 
I got it. So you want to get that standard up on the mat in order to be able to get it. What’s the 
standard? How are you going to know when you got it?
DENNIS
I guess when I hear my bells ring. 
KIPP
He wants the bells. We’ll give him the bells.
ERHARD
Listen, now. This is it.
KIPP
We’re going to demonstrate something so that every time you give signifi cance to your life, you 
can see what life really means. 
Kipp opened a dictionary and balanced it on his head. Then he held a chalkboard eraser in each
hand and walked around the room through the group, very solemnly clapping the two erasers to-
gether and dispensing eraser dust like the incense in a church processional. He approached Dennis
and clapped the erasers directly in front of him, as if dispensing a blessing. The room broke out into
extended applause and laughter.
ERHARD (to the group)
You understand he was illustrating you all; you’re just covert about it. That’s what you look like 
when you stand in the truth. Is that silly enough? Think you’ll remember that? When you’re 
pontifi cating, you want to remember that’s what you look like.
(to Dennis)
See: You’re wanting to make some signifi cance out of getting it.
