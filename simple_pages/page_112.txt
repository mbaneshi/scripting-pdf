SPEAKING BEING
MIKE
Just a bit. I see you pushing against this gentleman over here, and I’m understanding something
about anger. You’re saying, pushing it away, it’s still there. Kind of fuzzy.
ERHARD
When I push him away, am I not attached to him? 
MIKE
You’re touching him yes.
ERHARD
No, attached to him. I can’t get away from him as I’m pushing him away, can I?
MIKE
No you can’t.
ERHARD
So in a sense I’m attached to him, am I not?
MIKE
And you’re doing the attaching.
ERHARD
Never mind who is doing the attaching.
Erhard returned to the other participant and had him hold Erhard’s shoulders.
ERHARD
So, he’s got me now, right? And I can’t get away. He’s holding on to me, right?
MIKE
Right.
ERHARD
What’s the diff erence between that and this?
Erhard pushed the participant as he did in the previous instance.
ERHARD
In terms of being attached? Whether John is holding on to me, or I’m pushing him away, we are
r
equally attached.
MIKE
Okay.
