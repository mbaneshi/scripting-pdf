SPEAKING BEING
Areas of Greatest Impact
Before attending the workshop, we asked participants to indicate areas where they felt they needed improvement. Very
few people felt they needed a great deal of improvement in many of the 68 areas we questioned. Yet after the workshop,
many participants realized that they could improve themselves and their job performance dramatically in ways they hadn’t 
considered before the workshop. The ranking below shows the areas where the workshop had the greatest impact.
Being able to acknowledge mistakes fully and do what is necessary
to correct them.
Being fully committed to my company’s success.
Having high standards of quality for myself and the people who 
work with me and for me.
Confronting difficult situations head-on instead of avoiding them.
Always listening carefully and attentively to other people at work.
Being as concerned with the performance of my department/division
and the company overall as I am with my own performance.
Always being responsive to the concerns of those who work for me.
Being quick to give recognition to others for the work they do.
Welcoming constructive criticism from others.
Being very effective in communicating work related issues with 
my co-workers.
Being good at letting other people get all the credit they deserve.
Feeling free to be frank and open with those who report to me.
