Forum Day Four: Session Two

JOAN
Because I’m into suff ering.
KIPP
Okay good! Can you hear that that’s a decision?
JOAN
Yeah.
KIPP
And it’s a decision because the reason “I’m into suff ering” is doing the selecting, not you. You’re
the chooser. When you make a choice it’s based on nothing except you saying so. You are the
chooser. This is why it’s so diffi  cult, because your entire life has been used to reduce the risk.
Choice is going to put you fully into risk. You make the choice, you’re at risk, with no back door.
Start your own business, work for a small company: choose!
JOAN
My own company.
KIPP
Good. “I choose to start my own company because...”
JOAN (to applause)
Because I chose it.
KIPP
Because you choose it, yeah. And she messed up a little bit because she said she “chose” it.
Choice is never in the past. It’s only right now and right now and right now and right now. And
you wonder why the aliveness, the enthusiasm, the possibility starts disappearing from those
choices you’ve made in your life, it’s because you’ve stopped choosing. See you chose once...
(brushing hands together)r
“I chose fi fteen years ago! What do you want?” No, a choice is right now and right now and
right now and right now. Risky, huh?
JOAN
Yeah, that’s what I’ve been looking at the whole four days here, is that risk.

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
Which risk?
JOAN
Choosing. Choosing to be out there.
KIPP
Right. That is the risk. That’s what everybody here is up against. Nobody here is interested in liv-
ing their lives; they are very interested in having their reasons design their life—their thoughts,
their feelings, their considerations, not them, “not me! Then I couldn’t complain!” See, if you
choose, you can’t complain. It’s what everybody in here is up against. And what it is to be a
human being is to avoid responsibility. You cannot make somebody else responsible. You’ve
already tried doing that. You can’t even make yourself responsible. You can only choose to be
responsible. But we haven’t distinguished responsibility yet. Choice equals freedom because it’s
you choosing, not some reason.  I didn’t say reasons were bad. They just don’t give you: you!
JOAN
I got it.
KIPP
Thanks for staying with it.
Another participant stood.
ROSS
Somewhere along the line I got stuck in that you have to choose yes, and that if you choose no,
it’s not a real choice.
KIPP
No, no, no, they are both the same. A choice is a choice. So “I choose no because I choose no.”
ROSS
Whenever I’m presented with a choice...
KIPP
Notice how you said that: as if it is an edict. “Whenever I’m presented with a choice, at all times...”
ROSS
Sometimes when I am presented with a choice, I choose yes because, who would say no?
KIPP
But that’s not a choice then. That’s the reason: “Why would somebody say no?” That’s a deci-
sion, not a choice. A choice is a choice. You choosing for no reason, simply because you say so.
