Forum Day Four: Session Two 
441
JOAN
Because I’m into suff ering.
KIPP
Okay good! Can you hear that that’s a decision?
JOAN
Yeah.
KIPP
And it’s a decision because the reason “I’m into suff ering” is doing the selecting, not you. You’re 
the chooser. When you make a choice it’s based on nothing except you saying so. You are the
chooser. This is why it’s so diffi  cult, because your entire life has been used to reduce the risk.
Choice is going to put you fully into risk. You make the choice, you’re at risk, with no back door. 
Start your own business, work for a small company: choose!
JOAN
My own company.
KIPP
Good. “I choose to start my own company because...”
JOAN (to applause)
Because I chose it.
KIPP
Because you choose it, yeah. And she messed up a little bit because she said she “chose” it. 
Choice is never in the past. It’s only right now and right now and right now and right now. And 
you wonder why the aliveness, the enthusiasm, the possibility starts disappearing from those 
choices you’ve made in your life, it’s because you’ve stopped choosing. See you chose once...
(brushing hands together)r
“I chose fi fteen years ago! What do you want?” No, a choice is right now and right now and
right now and right now. Risky, huh?
JOAN
Yeah, that’s what I’ve been looking at the whole four days here, is that risk.
