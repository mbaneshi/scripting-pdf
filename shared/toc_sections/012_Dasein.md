Praise for Speaking Being
From the Aft erword:
I regard Speaking Being as an enormously important contribution to understanding
Heidegger and Erhard. The latter has received far too little serious academic
attention, and this book begins to make up for that lack. Moreover, the book‚Äôs
analysis of Heidegger‚Äôs thought is among the best that I have ever read. I commend
this book to all readers without reservation.
MICHAEL E. ZIMMERMAN, Professor Emeritus, University of Colorado, Boulder
This book is powerful, imaginative, frustrating, amusing, threatening, and
enlightening‚Äîall at the same time. It also has the power to transform your life.
JONATHAN D. MORENO, University of Pennsylvania Professor of Ethics,
author of Impromptu Man
The profound impact of Werner Erhard‚Äôs work on culture and society is a
manifestation of an incredible insight, the experience of being, presented in
this book through a comparative analysis of a transcript of a 1989 Forum led by
Erhard alongside Heidegger‚Äôs reflections on the meaning of ‚Äúbeing there.‚Äù The
authors have drawn amazing parallels between these two extraordinary thinkers
and have demonstrated the intersections of Heidegger‚Äôs language with Erhard‚Äôs
ontological rhetoric of transformation. Erhard has at times described aspects of his
method as ruthless compassion, and like all forms of compassion, evident here is a
fundamental motivating desire to alleviate the suff ering of others.

Medicine, and Senior Editor of  The Oxford Handbook of Compassion Science
Speaking Being is not a book. It is a multimodal tour de force of ontological rhetoric
that hails its reader into an event and in so doing performs as an event, rather
than what is commonly rendered as a book between two covers. Its status as an
event is performed on every page wherein the ‚Äúshowing‚Äù of Being is enacted via
its remarkable design. Kaleidoscopically, Bruce Hyde and Drew Kopp have drawn
their readers into a dazzling display, where the participants in dialogue with Werner
Erhard in a specific Forum in 1989 are put into dialogue with Martin Heidegger. The
result is arguably one of the most astounding academic interventions into both
Erhard‚Äôs methodology and Heideggerian thought. Citing David Farrell Krell, Hyde
and Kopp remind us that ‚Äúto be on a woodpath means to be in a cul-de-sac, a path
that leads nowhere and has no exit.‚Äù Speaking Being puts its readers in a dizzying
cul-de-sac within which they may never leave, but rather transform into one of the
glittering particles of this rhetorical kaleidoscope.
CYNTHIA HAYNES, Professor of English, Clemson University, author of  The Homesick
Phone Book: Addressing Rhetoric in the Age of Perpetual Conflict
Theory and Practice: Ways of seeing what one claims to be the truth of some
intended object of consciousness and ways of applying this truth to one‚Äôs
everyday existence in order to cultivate wisdom, goodness, self-realization, and
justice. The dialogical teachings of Werner Erhard speak to the importance of this
relationship and its ontological significance. Professors Hyde and Kopp, scholars
of rhetoric and communication who had observed and participated in programs
designed by Erhard, provide comprehensive and detailed conversations‚Äîwhat
they term ‚Äúontological rhetoric‚Äù‚Äîthat took place in Erhard‚Äôs 1989 Forum, and they
demonstrate how Erhard and Heidegger can be read together for the benefit of
both. This book is a major achievement in the scholarship of Erhard and Heidegger
studies. A much-needed moment of enlightenment.
MICHAEL J. HYDE, University Distinguished Professor of Communication Ethics, Wake
Forest University, author of Perfection: Coming to Terms with Being Human
In Speaking Being the reader discovers two original thinkers‚ÄîWerner Erhard
and Martin Heidegger‚Äîtwo intellects who independently reached linguistic,
ontological, and phenomenological philosophies that illuminate each other.

Authors Hyde and Kopp accomplish the formidable task of masterfully presenting
Erhard and Heidegger side by side in a readable, lively, and illuminating text. There
is nothing quite like it!

State University at Fresno, former Executive Vice-Chancellor for Academic Aff airs of
the California State University System
Educational research confirms that without a significant intervention, students
who become teachers are likely to replicate the pedagogical approaches their
teachers used with them. Practicing Erhard‚Äôs approach to ontological inquiry‚Äî
presented in print for the first time in this book‚Äîprovides such an intervention.
It equips students, teachers, academics of any field to critically examine their
dispositions and access more eff ective ways of being and acting. Speaking Being is
a must read for scholars of social foundations of education, teacher education, and
frankly, for members of any field of study.
CAROLYNE J. WHITE, Professor of Social Foundations, Department of Urban
Education, Rutgers University Newark
A diff erent you and a diff erent me must show up each day if we are going to
tackle the world‚Äôs most vexing problems. This book talks us through a process of
transformation by showing us what it means to be an authentic human being in an
inauthentic world, and what it means to take a stand for a world where everyone
matters and where everyone can make a diff erence.
WILEY ‚ÄúCHIP‚Äù SOUBA, MD, SCD, MBA, Professor of Surgery, Geisel School
of Medicine at Dartmouth, former Dean of Medicine and VP for Health Aff airs,
Dartmouth College
This engaging study of Erhard‚Äôs counter-discursive approach to transformational
education‚Äîand how this approach aligns significantly with Heidegger‚Äôs thinking‚Äî
might serve as a starting point for a deeper Indigenous philosophy. Rooted in a
more non-hierarchical epistemology, such an Indigenous philosophy promises to
move us away from a colonized and deeply problematized way of thinking, toward
embracing the power and mysteriousness of presence, and making possible a
place-based, non-anthropocentric interconnectedness. This is the next essential
step we must take if we are to survive as a species.

While some readers of Speaking Being may be familiar with The Landmark Forum,
most don‚Äôt know its connections to the philosophical tradition. Hyde and Kopp
have woven together concise explanations of Heidegger‚Äôs notoriously diff icult
thinking with an actual transcript of Erhard‚Äôs Forum‚Äîby turns moving, funny, and
shocking. This juxtaposition draws the reader into the experience and powerfully
illuminates the teachings of these two thinkers.
DAVID STOREY, Associate Professor, Boston College, author of
Naturalizing Heidegger
Speaking Being presents an ontological play between Erhard, Heidegger, the
participants of a Forum delivered in 1989, and the reader, who is summoned to
the scene to dwell in compelling questions and distinctions, the living of which
make available the invention of a life that is experienced as authentic. The
relentless commitment of authors Hyde and Kopp to communicate the unsayable,
Being, opens up new directions for a rhetoric of emancipation that goes beyond
traditional critical theories. Speaking Being speaks a new relation to language, one
that honors the unexplored ontological power of language to create a new freedom
to be, to live with existential courage.
