SPEAKING BEING
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Right. That’s there more powerfully than what she remembers. Is there anybody who doesn’t 
understand what I just said? Stand up. 
(a participant standing up)
I said, what’s there when it’s not recognized—I hate this word but I’m going to use it because 
it’s getting late and I want people to understand—what’s there and unconscious is there more 
powerfully in terms of its ability to shape your behavior and your feelings and thoughts than 
what’s there and is conscious. You got that?
PARTICIPANT
Yeah, I got it.
ERHARD
Okay, so that’s there whether she remembers it or not. And then there was this woman who 
came in and broke the bond, which was your haven, with your father.
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
Good. And I said that... I fi rst asked if you made any decisions. You remember that? 
(many participants replying “yes”)
Whatever it was, she made some decision. And I said this was a critical point, this was 
something that everybody’s got to get. I said: “we talk about it like ‘I decided,’ and maybe you 
did, but what really happened is that you became huh huh huh huh huh... You became that 
‘I’m worthless.’ It’s not merely ‘I decided.’ That’s not forceful enough. It’s: you became ‘I’m 
worthless.’” You remember that, vaguely?
JANE
A little.
ERHARD
Okay, good.
ERHARD (to the group)
You remember that?
