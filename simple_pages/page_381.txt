Forum Day Four: Session One
367
ERHARD
You understand it with the understanding you have, I get that. You understand it. Period. Now 
what is it that’s missing? 
GLORIA 
It makes me feel like shit. 
ERHARD
Yeah, you don’t like it. The man did not say you would like the truth. As a matter of fact, the 
fi rst thing the truth will do is piss you off . Didn’t you notice people in here? 
GLORIA (laughing)
I almost got into a fi ght last night because of that. 
ERHARD
Because of the truth?
GLORIA
Because of it was empty and meaningless. She was a Forum staff  person so it made me really 
want to punch her.
ERHARD
This is turning the truth into shit. How could empty and meaningless generate anything?
GLORIA (referring to Sally)
What she said about “fuck it.”
ERHARD
But that’s not the empty and meaningless that you got in here. That’s the empty and meaning-
less you got in the seminar on the other side of the wall. The one you paid $625 for, you didn’t 
get that one. You got the cheap one, you got the one that doesn’t cost anything. The $625 one 
does not give you any prescriptions, it does not justify anything. See, you want to use it to justi-
fy something. Right?
GLORIA
Yeah.
ERHARD
You think it justifi es doing nothing, but that’s not the empty and meaningless we’re talking 
about in here. The empty and meaningless we’re talking about in here justifi es nothing. And 
what bothers you is it’s going to invalidate your whole life because you’re a “rice Christian.” 
You didn’t work to work.
