BRADLEY
Me.
ERHARD
Did you get that?
BRADLEY
No, I’m still attaching meaning to it.
ERHARD
I’m not asking whether you are attaching meaning or not attaching meaning. You’re always
going to attach meaning.
BRADLEY
I will?
ERHARD
You are a machine that attaches meaning. As long as you’re functioning you will attach mean-
ing. However, it’s possible to attach meaning in the context that it’s empty and meaningless. It’s
possible to get that it’s empty and meaningless and attach meaning to it. See, this is not a con-
versation for convincing you of something. This is a conversation for leaving you dwelling in
the truth. Dwelling in the truth, you can’t use the truth. So the question is, did you get—and by
“get” I mean: “dwelling in” that it’s empty and meaningless? By “get” I mean: Are you “coming
from” that it’s empty and meaningless? Not: Are you attaching meaning to things?
BRADLEY
Yes.
ERHARD
Then you are welcome to sit down.
(addressing Jacob, standing)
You didn’t get it, right? You got it partly and partly you didn’t get it?
JACOB
Well I understand that, um, that a lot of times we try to take things for more than their face
value, which is what happened, and add a stupid story to it and try to give it meaning. But I was
wondering about your wording. When you say that it’s empty, is that where potential comes
from, or possibility?
ERHARD
Is that where what?
primordial metaphor (see the sidebar “Primordial Metaphor”
in the Second Session of Day Four)—or, in this case, the radical
undermining of meaning, since to bring Being (originative
meaning) to language we must also bring nothing to language,
and not merely ontically: the ontological saying of the nothing is
primal rhetoric.
The second sense of “rhetoric” is closer to the Aristotelian
tradition: that is, Heidegger, and especially Erhard, use the
language of nothing strategically, exploiting its paradoxical
y
possibilities to reorient the audience by revealing to that audience
its true relation to nothing and thus to Being. ■
Forum Day Four: Session One
345
JACOB
Is that where possibility comes from, being empty?
ERHARD
It may or may not, but, in my answering you in the context in which you are asking me, that
isn’t going to make any diff erence for you, because you’re asking me in order to understand.
If you do this exercise... the way we know you did the exercise is because possibility arises.
Now I didn’t ask that question yet, we’re going to ask that question in a little while because we
need to get this other thing fl at fi rst. What we want to get fl at is not did you fi gure this out, and
does it fi t with everything you know. But rather, did you get that life is empty and meaningless
and it’s empty and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless? It has no inherent meaning,
no inherent signifi cance. Life is like a rainstorm. It does not rain in order to water the little
fl owers. It just fucking rains and life is like that. Life is just like it is. Life is just that way. It’s
not that way for a reason. It’s just that way. It’s just the way it is, and it’s just devoid of meaning
and signifi cance, except to the degree that you bring some meaning and signifi cance to it. And
the meaning and signifi cance that people bring to it does what you saw in here over the last
three days. So that’s what there is to get. What there is to get is that life is empty and meaning-
less and it’s empty and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless. That is to say, it’s not only
empty and meaningless but you can’t make something out of that without getting into trouble.
Is that clear?
JACOB
Yeah. But...
ERHARD
You’re going to screw it up trying to make up a conclusion out of it.
JACOB
Yeah I am.
ERHARD
Don’t do that. Stop that.
JACOB
Okay.
(applause)
ERHARD
It’s very important what Jacob just illustrated for you. I heard you say it goes in and out and in
and out and in and out. It goes in and out and in and out because you try to make a conclusion.
I told you the truth has no use. It’s use-less. Worth-less. What is “worth”? Worth is what makes
Life is like a rainstorm. It does not rain in order
to water the little flowers. It just fucking rains
and life is like that. Life is just like it is. Life is
just that way. It’s not that way for a reason.
It’s just that way. It’s just the way it is, and it’s
just devoid of meaning and significance, except
to the degree that you bring some meaning
and significance to it. And the meaning and
significance that people bring to it does what
you saw in here over the last three days.
“
346
SPEAKING BEING
you right. That’s the only thing that’s worth anything. Something that makes you right; that’s
worth something. Something that makes somebody or something else wrong; that’s worth
something. Something with which you can dominate; that’s worth something. Something with
which you can avoid domination; that’s worth something. Something you can justify yourself
with or invalidate others; that’s worth something.
(loudly)
The truth isn’t worth anything. It’s worthless because you can’t use it. And the instant you try to
draw a conclusion from it, you make a “therefore”; you put a “therefore” behind the truth and
it sucks all the truth out of it. It’s no longer true; it is now more bullshit. You stumble across the
truth, you happen to bump into it, leave it alone. By leave it alone I don’t mean walk away from
it, or ignore it, I mean: let it be. Is that clear? You want to take that page out of Jacob’s book,
and it will move things forward here more rapidly. And we won’t still be here Monday morn-
ing.
(Jacob sits as Erhard addresses another standing participant)
You did not get that it’s empty and meaningless?
DENNIS
I want to believe that I’m getting it, but I’m not getting it.
ERHARD
What is it that you’re not getting?
DENNIS
That life is empty and meaningless.
ERHARD
Okay. What is the meaning of life?
DENNIS
I don’t know. That’s what I’m here for.
WES
I’m now going to tell you. You want to know the meaning of life? Let me tell you the meaning
of life, and then you’ll know the meaning of life and you’ll see the diff erence it makes in your
life.
Wes got a dictionary from the table and read from it the defi nition of “life”: “The property or quality
that distinguishes living organisms from dead organisms...etc.”
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day Four: Session One
347
ERHARD
It’s all clear now, isn’t it? It’s all clear now. Absolutely. That cleared it all up, now didn’t it? Go
on Wes.
(after much laughter, Wes continues to read several defi nitions of “life”)
It’s all clear now isn’t it?
DENNIS
No it’s not...
ERHARD
Listen up. You’ve got a hidden standard for getting it. Did you hear what I said? You’ve got a
hidden standard for getting it. It’s kind of like, when I hear the angels trumpet then I’ll know
I got it. So you want to get that standard up on the mat in order to be able to get it. What’s the
standard? How are you going to know when you got it?
DENNIS
I guess when I hear my bells ring.
KIPP
He wants the bells. We’ll give him the bells.
ERHARD
Listen, now. This is it.
KIPP
We’re going to demonstrate something so that every time you give signifi cance to your life, you
can see what life really means.
Kipp opened a dictionary and balanced it on his head. Then he held a chalkboard eraser in each
hand and walked around the room through the group, very solemnly clapping the two erasers to-
gether and dispensing eraser dust like the incense in a church processional. He approached Dennis
and clapped the erasers directly in front of him, as if dispensing a blessing. The room broke out into
extended applause and laughter.
ERHARD (to the group)
You understand he was illustrating you all; you’re just covert about it. That’s what you look like
when you stand in the truth. Is that silly enough? Think you’ll remember that? When you’re
pontifi cating, you want to remember that’s what you look like.
(to Dennis)
See: You’re wanting to make some signifi cance out of getting it.
348
SPEAKING BEING
DENNIS
That’s correct.
ERHARD
And getting it is to get that there is no signifi cance. So there can’t be any signifi cance in getting
it. You want to know where you’ve got your foot nailed to the fl oor? When you were younger
somebody told you some bullshit about what it was to get it. What were you told when you were
young about what it was to be enlightened, to get it?
DENNIS
I was brought up believing that one should be successful and make things happen for yourself,
to be in control.
ERHARD
Yeah, and you know that was the product of the culture in which you were brought up, and
family in which you were brought up, and the time of history in which you were brought up.
And you know, there are cultures in which success is looked down upon, in which you have to
hide your success. You know that, right?
DENNIS
Sure.
ERHARD
Sure. So what’s the signifi cance of that? I mean, which is right? Which is the right way to
go? Is the right way to go and devote your life to success, or to devote your life to something
else? Which is the right way to go? Do you see that the question is insane? You go the way you
go. The question whether it is right or wrong is irrelevant, stupid, is stupefying. Look at how
stupid it made you. That was not an insult. It was just a report. Look at the stupidity that you’ve
revealed in your own lives. You know, the “at the heart of it” stupidity. Yeah there’s nothing
wrong with being oriented around and regarding being successful or accomplishment highly.
DENNIS
Yeah but, I feel like... I don’t consider myself overly successful, but somewhat successful, like
you said...
ERHARD
Here’s how successful you are. I’ve seen your bank account: You’re as successful as you are.
That’s how successful you are and it’ll probably remain like that. No matter how much you
accomplish, you will only be as successful as you are, and you will not be as successful as you
aren’t. And that’s the way it’s going to be for the rest of your life. Right? It’s like “who’s buried
in Grant’s tomb?”
Forum Day Four: Session One
349
DENNIS
Sure I can buy that.
ERHARD
Grant is buried in Grant’s tomb, and that’s about how complex this whole thing is. Things are
the way they are and things are not the way that they are not, and they are always like that and
they don’t change.
DENNIS
See, I have a hard time... I want to believe, Werner...
ERHARD
I appreciate that...
DENNIS
...but it’s like, I came here with some conceptions that... “Okay, I am here, because I feel fi ne.
I am successful. There are certain things wrong I would like to fi x.” Sitting here, wanting to
believe, but I’m hearing, “let it be.”
ERHARD
I never said “let it be.” That’s somebody else’s horseshit. I never said “let it be,” because you
can’t do anything but let it be--and pretend that you’re doing something else. What I said is
“what is, is, and what isn’t, isn’t.” That’s mine. That’s pretty goddamned safe. I’ll take on any-
body who wants to attack me on that one.
DENNIS
No, I’m not trying to attack you...
ERHARD
No, no, I know you’re not trying to attack me. I did not mean to imply that, and I’m sorry if it
sounded like I did.
DENNIS
No, I’m just trying...
ERHARD
You’re trying to hear bells. All you’re going to hear is simplicity.
DENNIS
Yeah, I guess I came here thinking that four days and three hours on the fi fth day is going to
make a diff erence in my life. I just can’t go home and quit and say the rest will be history. You
have to go back to your life.
350
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Nobody said “quit.” Okay go on.
DENNIS
Right, I know. When I try to make sense out of believing there is no meaning...
ERHARD
No, I don’t want you to believe that there’s no meaning; that would make you crazy.
DENNIS
Yeah, if I went home and said that life doesn’t make any sense, it doesn’t mean anything...
ERHARD
I didn’t say it doesn’t make any sense. I said it’s empty and meaningless, and it’s empty and
meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless. That’s all I’ve said. And if you went home and
said it’s empty and meaningless and it’s empty and meaningless that it’s empty and meaning-
less, you would get into trouble. See, just like I would get into trouble if I said that to people
who didn’t pay me $625. And I don’t say it to people who don’t pay me $625, and then I don’t
say it until the third day. Don’t tell people life is empty and meaningless, because they can’t
hear you. They can’t hear that because it’s all the way down at the bottom. Where are they?
They’re all the way up at the top. They’re fl oating on all that soap opera and drama, all those
rackets and all that act. They can’t see down through the murk that it’s empty and meaning-
less. What you’ve been through is designed to take you down one layer at a time, until you can
get far enough down so that you can see that all the way down it’s empty and meaningless.
And it’s very, very diffi  cult to get down there because you can’t use that. And that’s kind of
what you’re complaining about. It didn’t leave you feeling wonderful. It didn’t leave you free
and easy and wonderful, and it never does until you get there. The secret is perfectly hidden.
That’s why almost nobody gets it. It’s why it took three days, four days of hammering to get you
close to getting it. And you may not get it. But I want you to know something: That’s all there is
to get here. What there is to get for your $625, and the four days and three hours crushing your
backside, is that life is empty and meaningless, and that it’s empty and meaningless that it’s
empty and meaningless. And that the soap opera you’ve made out of your life is a very bad joke.
It’s a bad joke. You’ve made everything signifi cant and meaningful and it’s caused you to suff er.
And not only the bad things, but you suff er the good things, because the good things don’t
leave you fulfi lled and whole and complete. They don’t leave you full of joy and satisfi ed. So
you not only suff er the bad things, you suff er the good things as well. Your life is nothing but
suff ering. And the source of suff ering is a lie. There’s only one source of suff ering. The source
of suff ering is a lie. Stop lying and you’ll stop suff ering. And the fundamental lie is that it all
means something, that it’s going to work out, that you’re going to make it someday, that you’re
going to get there, that someday the fairy prince is going to come along, or the fairy princess is
going to come along, or someday the right job, or someday the right life, or someday the right
body. That’s the lie that keeps the suff ering in place. When you get to empty and meaningless
you get that there’s no more suff ering. All there is, is possibility. Freedom. Openness. But you
Your life is nothing but suff ering. And the
source of suff ering is a lie. There’s only one
source of suff ering. The source of suff ering is a
lie. Stop lying and you’ll stop suff ering. And the
fundamental lie is that it all means something,
that it’s going to work out, that you’re going
to make it someday, that you’re going to get
there, that someday the fairy prince is going
to come along, or the fairy princess is going
to come along, or someday the right job, or
someday the right life, or someday the right
body. That’s the lie that keeps the suff ering
in place.

can’t get to empty and meaningless in-order-to. And every time you turn it into an in-order-to,
you lose that it’s empty and meaningless, because the truth is sucked out of it, and it becomes a
mere platitude.
DENNIS
I just want to end with saying that I will leave here with the thought that life is empty and
meaningless and that opens up a possibility.
ERHARD
I don’t want you to leave with “it opens up a possibility.” That ruins it.
DENNIS
Is that an in-order-to?
ERHARD
Yeah. See, you’re a real in-order-to guy. That’s not bad. That’s not an insult. That’s highly valued
in this culture. We place a lot of value in this culture in in-order-to.
DENNIS
Thank you.
ERHARD
Yep. Very good. Thank you.
(applause)
(turning to another participant)
What is your story?
JOYCE
My story is that I get it and I reject it.
ERHARD
Okay. Don’t do that. What are you crying about? Do you know? Yeah, you know, what are you
crying about?
JOYCE
Because I came to make a change in my life and I don’t see it happening.
ERHARD
Yes. I understand. So, you wanted to make a change in your life because there’s a little suff er-
ing there, yes? Yeah. The way to perpetuate the suff ering is to try to change your life. You stop
changing your life, the suff ering will go away. Is that clear?
352
SPEAKING BEING
JOYCE
Yes. It’s clear.
ERHARD
So, don’t do that anymore. Cut that out. Stop rejecting it. Stop trying to get better. Stop trying to
change your life. What is it you want out of life, that’s so goddamned important that you want
to change your life? What is it that’s bothering you because it’s missing?
JOYCE
I want to like myself. I don’t like myself.
ERHARD
Okay. Now. Start not liking yourself. Do that right now. Don’t like yourself right now.
(Joyce laughing)
What are you smiling about? I thought you said you didn’t like yourself.
(laughter)
Don’t like yourself some more. This is pretty good. Now don’t like yourself even more. You
notice everything changed. Now like yourself. Like yourself.
JOYCE
It’s not diff erent.
ERHARD
It’s no fucking diff erent is it?
(laughter)
Liking yourself and not liking yourself are the same thing: It’s all bullshit.
(raising his voice to a pitch)
What is this goddamned fantasy about liking yourself? What in the fuck is that? That’s crazy!
That’s like walking around saying “Don’t look! Don’t look! Oh my God there’s a man back there
following me with a knife with blood dripping down.” Bullshit people made up: liking your-
self/not liking yourself. You know what not liking yourself is? It’s a conversation you have with
yourself. Bullshit people made up, this “liking yourself/not liking yourself.” You know what
not liking yourself is? It’s a conversation you have with yourself.
JOYCE
It’s a conversation I constantly have with myself.
ERHARD
Yeah, but stop it then. This is craziness. What is the signifi cance of liking yourself or not liking
yourself? Does it change a hair on your head?
Forum Day Four: Session One
353
JOYCE
It doesn’t change anything externally.
ERHARD
It doesn’t change anything. It doesn’t change any little thing. It changes absolutely nothing. It’s
a bullshit conversation. It’s like talking about “Which way is left?”
(to Joyce)
Which way is left?
(she points to her left)
No, that’s right.
JOYCE
No, it’s not right.
ERHARD
It is so right!
JOYCE
To you.
ERHARD
But do you see how nonsensical this conversation is between you and me now?
JOYCE
Yes.
ERHARD
Liking yourself and not liking yourself is just as nonsensical. You got conned into some bullshit
conversation.
JOYCE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Did you ever hear people on drugs talking? They’re like, nutty. Like myself/don’t like myself is
the same crap. “Whoa. Sha? Go man! Jack Damn!” What does all that shit mean?
(laughter)
It’s all drama, drama. You ever been to the movies?
354
SPEAKING BEING
JOYCE
Yeah.
ERHARD
People are acting up there. It’s not for real. This is your act, not liking yourself. It’s your act.
JOYCE
I get that. I get that I put on an act.
ERHARD
There’s nothing to like or not like. What does that mean: like or don’t like? You are the way you
are. That’s the whole story, isn’t it?
JOYCE
Yeah.
ERHARD
And you’re always going to be the way you are. And you’re going to be the way you are when
you are the way you are. Today you are the way you are today. Tomorrow you’ll be like the way
you’ll be tomorrow. And the day after that you’ll be like you are the day after that. And that’s
going to be true for the rest of your life. What is this conversation like or don’t like yourself?
What does this mean? This is insane this conversation I like, I don’t like. And you ought to be
able to begin to see the insanity of it. It’s like really insane. What is it about, for God’s sake?
What is the point? The point is drama, like soap opera. You know, you use life to make a soap
opera: that’s disgusting. Life is empty and meaningless. It’s just like that.
JOYCE
I see that. It doesn’t make any diff erence whether I like myself or not. But I’m stuck. I want to
like myself.
ERHARD
But no. Let me ask you something. Listen up you all! What happens when you raise the issue of
liking yourself? What has to go with the issue of liking yourself? Must. What is it that has to be
there in order for you to like yourself? There’s only one thing that has got to be there for you to
have the issue of liking yourself.
JOYCE
What would have to go with it?
ERHARD
Yeah. What is it that has to be there in order for you to like yourself? There’s only one thing
that’s got to be there.
Forum Day Four: Session One
355
JOYCE
Not liking yourself?
ERHARD
Yeah. Obvious, huh? You can’t have liking yourself without not liking yourself. Get rid of both
of them. It’s a bullshit conversation. There’s nothing in there. It’s pure drama.
JOYCE
It’s arguing with yourself.
ERHARD
It’s like arguing if you’re blue or green. Are you blue or green?
JOYCE
I’m neither.
ERHARD
Absolutely. It’s like, are you likable or unlikable? It’s like asking you if you’re blue or green.
It’s the same kind of question. Are you blue or green? It’s nonsense. It’s garbage, and if you
ask garbage questions you get garbage answers. Every time someone likes theirself, what gets
reinforced?
JOYCE
I don’t know.
ERHARD
Not liking theirself. Don’t you see that you can’t have a lot of liking yourself and just a little
bit of not liking yourself? They got to be exactly even, because you can’t build liking yourself
except in contrast to not liking yourself.
JOYCE
You’re saying to throw both of them away.
ERHARD
Yeah. This is a garbage question liking yourself/not liking yourself. Cut that out. Hold some-
body’s hand; look up at the sky; go make something happen: But don’t waste your time with the
question of liking yourself or not liking yourself. That’s your racket.
JOYCE  (weeping)
One of my rackets...
356
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Right: and a signifi cant racket for you. What you have to get to is that it’s empty and meaning-
less. Underneath your racket is all empty and meaningless. If I take away liking yourself and
not liking yourself, what are you left with? Nothing. There’s where we want to leave you: with
nothing. Is that clearer?
JOYCE
Yeah, but I don’t want to be left with nothing.
ERHARD
I know, because there’s a payoff  in not liking yourself. You’re getting something out of it. You’re
a racketeer. You’re in it for the payoff .
JOYCE
Yes, I am.
ERHARD
Yeah. You like the payoff , be my guest.
JOYCE
No I don’t like it.
ERHARD
Then cut it out. And if you can’t cut it out, where you need to get to is that underneath the
racket is empty and meaningless. You have to see that your racket’s a joke. You’re not going to
get rid of your racket, ever. You get rid of one, you’ll fi nd another one under that. It’s endless.
It’s rackets all the way down, I told you. It’s like peeling an onion. You take off  one racket, you
get another racket. You take off  another racket, you get another racket. You know what’s at the
center of an onion? Nothing. When you pull the last layer off , what’s left? Nothing. Sorry for the
cheap metaphor. Life is empty and meaningless and it doesn’t mean anything that life is empty
and meaningless. Did you get it? I didn’t say “did you feel good?” I said “did you get it?”
JOYCE
Life is empty and meaningless that life is empty and meaningless means nothing.
ERHARD
No. It’s life is empty and meaningless and that doesn’t mean anything. Don’t give any meaning
to that. See, you’re trying to make that mean something. Like, “Well, then I shouldn’t have to
bother!” No. It doesn’t mean anything; you can’t make meaning out of it, otherwise you destroy
it. And as soon as you do make it mean something you take the truth power out of it; you take
the truth value out of it. Then it becomes some stupid platitude that you bother people with.
“Don’t you know that life is empty and meaningless?” People don’t want to hear that shit.
Forum Day Four: Session One
357
(laughter)
Don’t go around telling people life is empty and meaningless. Live your life from it. Don’t tell
people that. So what there is to get is that life is empty and meaningless and that that doesn’t
have any meaning. That is to say: the fact that life is empty and meaningless is empty and
meaningless. It’s just empty and meaningless.
JOYCE
I get that.
ERHARD
Okay, that’s all there is to get for the moment. I didn’t say you have to feel good.
Erhard continued working one by one with the people who had stood because they did not get that
life is empty and meaningless.
ERHARD  (to another participant)
What is your problem?
SALLY
I’m having a hard time with life being empty and meaningless that life is empty and
meaningless.
ERHARD
Let me make it easy for you. Life is empty and meaningless: Did you get that part?
SALLY
Yes.
ERHARD
What does that mean? What is the signifi cance of that statement?
SALLY
That it’s empty and meaningless, but I’m sitting here thinking, “Fuck it! Who cares?”
ERHARD
No, you just made it mean something. You didn’t get it because you made it mean something.
You said, “well if it’s empty and meaningless then...” See, once you said “then,” you didn’t get
it; you ruined it. Is that clear what I just said?
SALLY
Yeah, then it becomes something. Then it means something.
