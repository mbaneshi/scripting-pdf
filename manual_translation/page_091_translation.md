Forum Day One: Session Four 
77
PARTICIPANT
My already always listening is “I’m very clever and I’ll prove it to you.”
ERHARD
See, there are times when “I’m very clever and I’ll prove it to you” is a very workable listening. 
But if you’re already always “I’m very clever and I’ll prove it to you,” there are a lot of occasions 
that doesn’t match. 
PARTICIPANT
I have several of these. My listening is that “I’m not good enough.”
ERHARD
“I’m not good enough” almost always has got another listening, which is “I’m better than you 
are.” “I’m not good enough but I’m better than you are.” You want to listen up. These guys are 
being authentic about their own inauthenticity. These are not nice people. They are cold, calcu-
lating, conniving people. They are out to get you to like them. And it’s not them. They didn’t in-
vent that. And if this is the opening that I’m providing for the world to occur in, it’s not surpris-
ing how the world shows up. We have done some work facilitating meetings between American 
and Soviet representatives. We discovered that the already always listening of the Americans is 
“You can’t be trusted for your word; now let’s talk.” This made the results predictable.
PARTICIPANT
My always already listening is “I’m too smart and too quick, and I better not let anyone know 
that.”
ERHARD
It’s the “already always way of listening.” I keep losing why the order is important, but there’s 
some significance to the order. What is the already always listening that gives you being the way 
you are? Believe it or not, the way you are is given to you by your listening. 
PARTICIPANT
“You’re boring.”
ERHARD
We’re going to take a break. I want you to consider that the way you are is given to you by your 
listening. I’m inviting you to get down to the already always listening, you know, as deep as you 
can, however deep that happens to be. Clear?
The Forum adjourned for the final break of the day at 10 pm.
