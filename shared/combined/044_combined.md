SPEAKING BEING
not the reasons, nobody else and nothing else. And you have reasons. That’s what I mean by
people don’t know their ass from a hole in the ground. People don’t know what put them in that
chair. If you’re stuck with this idea that you were pressured, I want you out of here. I’m going
to say a lot of things in here and you’re only going to get them almost. I know that today you’re
going to get almost nothing I say, because you’re going to put it in the language in which you
dwell. Like “should.” I don’t dwell in the language of should. It’s patently obvious here. I’m
asking you who’s buried in Grant’s Tomb. This is not hard. You put yourself here.
A participant raised a question about a friend he wanted to do The Forum. He described the man.
PARTICIPANT
Would he feel pressured?
ERHARD
Yeah, because he’s an asshole.
PARTICIPANT (laughs)
Yeah, that’s true.
ERHARD
You see, you can’t pressure people who are straight. They give clear answers, like “no,” or
“don’t call me.” I invite people. I want to be clear what I mean by an invitation. An invitation
for me always carries with it the power to decline.
Erhard mounted the platform, and announced a break. However, he said, “in The Forum there are
no breaks,” so he gave the participants an assignment.
ERHARD
The assignment during the break is to sort out your “story” from “what happened.” Most people
live in the story and don’t live in the what happened. And there’s something disempowering
about living in the story instead of living in the what happened. The problem is that you are
thrown—that’s like already always—you are thrown to the story. You are addicted to the story.
“People don’t like me” and “being insulted” never happen. I’m going to demonstrate insulting.
I’m going to insult you: I insult you. For the fi rst time in your life you’ve now been insulted as a
what happened. All the other times, someone said something, and you got insulted. People have
t
said you’re a jerk. But that’s somebody saying “You’re a jerk.” The insult was a story.
t
Having given the assignment, Erhard called Julie, The Forum Supervisor, to the podium.
ERHARD
Julie’s the person who keeps this organized enough so that it can happen. So your cooperation
with her is in your interest.
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day One: Session One
31
After Erhard left the room, Julie requested that due to the size of the group all participants should
be respectful of the hotel. She pointed out the assistants who could direct participants to pay phones
and bathrooms. “We request that you don’t eat on this break,” she said. “If you must eat for medical
reasons, please see Wes,” one of the two Forum leaders who were assisting Erhard. Finally she in-
troduced the other four Forum supervisors who were working with her, and who were available to
answer their questions. Finally, as she would before every break, she read the names of participants
who had received telephone messages during the session.
The Forum adjourned for a break at 12:40 pm.

SPEAKING BEING
Hints: Ontological Distinctions
The Forum achieves its result through the development in dialogue of what Werner
Erhard calls distinctions. In traditional education, based in an epistemological model
in which the goal is to increase or enhance what is known, information—concepts,
ideas, processes—are communicated through definition and explanation. The Fo-
rum, however, develops an ontological model of education, in which the goal is not
an increase in knowledge but an experience of Being. In this model, the elements of
the course content are distinguished.
The nature of distinctions will be addressed at length by Erhard later in The
Forum. But here, early on the first morning, the development of distinctions is al-
ready under way. Erhard is beginning to employ an aspect of his methodology that,
according to Martin Heidegger, is central to ontological communication: the use of
hints to communicate what cannot directly be spoken, thereby providing access to
the content as lived rather than as merely understood.
Heidegger introduced the idea of hinting as a way of communicating Being in
his 1959 essay, “A Dialogue on Language” (in OWL), which provides an account of
his conversation with a Japanese scholar who shared his interest in ontological
inquiry. The interaction, presented in the form of a transcript, occurs as a stately
conversational dance, a linguistic minuet. Each move is made with great care, so the
interaction proceeds at times with excruciating deliberateness. At one point Heide-
gger (referred to in the account as the Inquirer) poses a question—“Do you have in
your language a word for what we call language?”—to which the scholar arrives at
a tentative answer only after twenty-three pages of thoughtful circumnavigation in
and around the topic.
In response to a remark by the Japanese about language’s “essential being,”
Heidegger refers to his often-quoted characterization of language as “the house of
Being.” The phrase, he says, “gives a hint of the nature of language” (“DL” in OWL
26). As the two men’s dialogue continues, the extraordinary attentiveness given
to each word reveals a respect for the nature of hints. Hints, Heidegger observes,
“belong to an entirely different realm of reality. . . . They are enigmatic. They beckon
to us. They beckon away. They beckon us toward that from which they unexpectedly
bear themselves toward us” (“DL” in OWL 26).
In his conversation with the Japanese scholar, Heidegger is distinguishing
hinting, which is to say that he is hinting at the nature of hints. The Forum’s develop-
ment of distinctions is likewise a process of hinting.
SESSION ONE INTERVAL
In hinting, words are spoken in such a way that “each word in each case is
given its full—most often hidden—weight” (“DL” in OWL 31). What is not spoken, but
communicated in the background, is allowed to reverberate. In this way a space is
allowed to develop around each utterance:
[Inquirer]: Hints need the widest sphere in which to swing. . .
[Japanese]: . . . where mortals go to and fro only slowly.
[Inquirer]: This is what our language calls “hesitate.” It is done
truly when slowness rests on shy reverence. And so I do not wish to
disturb your hesitation by urging you on too rashly.
[Japanese]: You are more helpful to me in my attempt to say the
word than you can know. (“DL” in OWL 27–28)
Further, although each distinction has a rubric for its topic—in this dialogue, the
topic is the nature of language—in developing distinctions the aim is not to arrive at
a correct verbal articulation of the rubric. On the contrary, the goal is to avoid such a
resolution:
[Japanese]: We Japanese do not think it strange if a dialogue
leaves undefined what is really intended, or even restores it
back to the keeping of the undefinable.
[Inquirer]: That is part, I believe, of every dialogue that
has turned out well between thinking beings. As if of its own
accord, it can take care that that undefinable something not
only does not slip away, but displays its gathering force ever
more luminously in the course of the dialogue. (“DL” in OWL 13)
In this conversation, Heidegger and the Japanese scholar may be seen as
enacting the methodology of The Forum: the dialogic development of distinctions
through a process of hinting. Being cannot be verbalized. Being is in language, but
it is not in the words that are spoken. It lives in the unspoken background, and in
a conversation for Being, that background must be made present. Hints are an
appropriate form for bringing a background to presence because they direct our
attention toward something we had not noticed, something which they at the same
time bring forward to meet us.
Ontological hinting is not an easy form of communication to master, and by
characterizing it here as an element of The Forum’s “methodology,” we have fallen
prey to one of its pitfalls. When Heidegger says to the Japanese scholar that calling
“
“

33
language “the house of Being” gives a “hint of the nature of language,” the scholar
immediately recognizes the danger: “I fear that to call your ‘house of Being’ a hint
might tempt you and me to elaborate the notion of hinting into a guiding concept in
which we then bundle up everything” (“DL” in OWL).  Heidegger concurs, but adds
that this error can “never be prevented in the sense of being totally excluded,” since
“the mode of conceptual representation insinuates itself all too easily into every
kind of human experience” (“DL” in OWL 25).
A relevant observation by the senior author: during my years of participation in
Erhard’s work, the distinguishing of distinctions has remained a source of fascina-
tion, challenge, and even mystery for me. I have observed conversations between
Forum leaders—people for whom the development of distinctions is central to their
professional practice—in which the speaking occurred to me as a kind of short-
hand. Elements of everyday interaction—details,  transitions, connections—seemed
to be missing. On one occasion, a statement by one Forum leader elicited this re-
sponse from another: “You’re explaining it. Distinguish it.” I found myself struggling
to recognize the difference being referred to.
An extensive hint at the nature of distinctions is found in Heidegger’s later work,
where he turned his attention increasingly to the ontological possibilities of art, and
specifically of poetry. Poetry, he said, is projective saying—that is, a kind of saying
which projects a clearing for Being by speaking the unspoken. “Projective saying
is saying which, in preparing the sayable, simultaneously brings the unsayable as
such into a world” (“OWA” in PLT 71). But such saying is not limited to the speaking
of the poet, because “Language itself is poetry in the essential sense” (“OWA” in PLT
72). Indeed, “everyday language is a forgotten and used-up poem, from which there
hardly resounds a call any longer” (“L” in PLT 205).
The thinker, says Heidegger elsewhere, confines his thinking to a single
thought (PLT 4). Heidegger’s single thought was the question of Being. A similar
single-mindedness characterizes the poet, and so Heidegger’s description of the
poet’s relation to the unsayable is useful:
Every great poet creates his poetry out of one single
poetic statement only. . . . The poet’s statement remains
unspoken. None of his individual poems, nor their totality,
says it all. Nonetheless, every poem speaks from the whole
of the one single statement, and in each instance says that
statement. (“LP” in OWL 160)
“
Therefore all of Heidegger’s writing and all of Werner Erhard’s work, as well as all the
poetry of Dickinson or Rilke or Wallace Stevens, may be seen as bodies of hints for
the Saying of what is essentially unsayable.
34
SPEAKING BEING
During the forty-minute break, statements had been written on two of the chalkboards. On one:
“Promise of The Forum: You can have anything out of The Forum that you are willing to stand for
having gotten.” On the second: “The commitment of the work is Transformation: bringing forth a
breakthrough in the possibility of being for human beings.”
As The Forum resumed, Erhard began with a question.
ERHARD
What happened when you were considering the diff erence between your story and what hap-
pened?
PARTICIPANT
I found that I didn’t want to confront my stories.
ERHARD
It’s possible to live in a kind of unconsciousness that we don’t ordinarily call unconsciousness
because we’re not knocked out. It’s an unconsciousness which appears as not being there. What
you can’t be with prevents you from being. If you mash up the what happens and the story, it
kind of keeps you a little unconscious, because you don’t have to be with it. But when you start
to distinguish the story from what happened, you begin to see the story as a story, and it’s not
very attractive that way, is it? And it’s something one would mostly avoid being with. There
will be a lot that will come up in here that you don’t want to be with. It’s useful to be with what
you don’t want to be with. What you’ve already learned to be with and survive with--that’s not
going to be very useful in here, it’s the part you’ve avoided being with here. Anything else?
Thanks very much.
As participants responded to this question, Erhard contextualized their contributions by expanding
the distinctions he had introduced earlier in the day.
JOHN
I’ve never really liked my wife’s version of the story of how we got married.
ERHARD
When you can recognize a person’s story as their story, you begin to have access to their version
of the story, so that you’re not stuck with, you don’t have to resign yourself to, their version of
the story. You have access to diff erent possibilities within the story, but not when it’s mashed up
with what happened.
JOHN
I got so upset, I left the room, and while I heard the story from another part of the house, my
upset turned toward wanting to get out of my marriage.
ERHARD  (interrupting)
You didn’t invent thinking about getting out of your marriage. That’s already always in the cul-
ture of being for human beings. You think, “oh well, this happened and that made me think I

Forum Day One: Session Two

Philosophy as Rhetorical Evocation
We propose that The Forum is an instance of ontological
rhetoric. We emphasize at the outset that this is not the everyday
understanding of rhetoric as “mere rhetoric,” that is, language that
is superficial and disconnected from serious purposes. Rhetoric as
we use the term is any use of language that is intended to produce
a real-world result. Ontological rhetoric communicates in the
unspoken realm of language to provide its listeners with access to
the realm of Being.
Recognition of the value and function of ontological
rhetoric is found in the later writing of Henry W. Johnstone,
Jr., founder of the journal, Philosophy and Rhetoric. Early in his
career, Johnstone believed that the role of the philosophical
rhetor was “to treat his audience as an object,” and that his goal
should quit or leave.” That’s not the way it works. It’s a rainstorm. Leaving, getting out of things,
quitting—owns your life. It’s true you have the conversation with yourself personally. But that’s
like getting wet in a rainstorm.
(with emphasis)
I’m not thinking that. That is thinking me.
(pausing)
I’m starting to talk like people don’t talk, because I want access to what concerns me that
people don’t have. So you and I are starting to invent a language that gives us access to the
things that are interesting, or important, that concern us in life. It’s not your thought. I want
you to start to think that it thinks you. You have the thoughts like you get wet in the rain-
storm. I’m just asking you to begin to think in a way you haven’t thought before. The kind of
person you are is given by that thinking, which isn’t your thoughts or your thinking.
JOHN
What I noticed was that each of us have diff erent stories about how we got together.
ERHARD
You can’t ask questions like “True?” about people’s stories. There’s no such thing as “true
”
stories.” “True” and “story” don’t go together. A story’s a story. People get into trouble in life
because they start believing their stories. Even worse, you start believing someone else’s story—
makes you a spear-carrier in somebody else’s opera. This is not a good way to live.
JOHN
We did what we did and got married.
ERHARD
Who is not clear about choosing to be married? The conversation about why you’re in The
Forum could apply as well to you in your job, or your marriage. Almost nobody thinks they
are anyplace because they put themselves there. But everybody puts themselves there. Then
you get the story about why you’re there. There’s no power in the story... You live in a story
about being married. I accuse you that you live in a story about being married, and the
quality of being married reflects that it in part is generated by a story. I didn’t say you don’t
have a good marriage. But it’s limited to a certain box, a certain space or quality, when it’s a
story. What happened? You got married. Then there’s this whole story. And they’re distinct
from one another. The same thing is true about everything in life. See, you and I have the
kind of lives that people would have if they lived out of a story. And mostly the story is
constituted mostly by your reasons. But you got that job. That’s what happened.
JOHN
Normally I know that, but I wasn’t clear about that last night. It’s so easy to forget.

SPEAKING BEING
was “to manipulate his audience so as to secure agreement”
(“Persuasion” 19). But a “turn” in Johnstone’s thinking led him
to acknowledge by 1978 that “the distinction between finding
the truth in philosophy and finding the proper rhetorical devices
for propagating it cannot be maintained” (“Truth” 74). In other
words, “truth” is always and already rhetorical, never severed
from its communication, and thus finding the “truth” requires
holding up a pretense that rhetoric is merely a convenient
accessory that can be dispensed with.
Johnstone’s new perspective of the philosophy–rhetoric
relationship was based in the concept of evocation: “My present
view is that a successful argument in philosophy is one that is
intended to evoke, and does evoke, a response of a certain kind
in the man to whom it is addressed” (“Truth” 75). Johnstone cited
Heidegger as evidence for this view, and his description here of
Heidegger’s language use is consistent with our understanding of
both Heidegger’s and Erhard’s thinking:
ERHARD
That’s why we don’t give you anything to remember. You just have to be.
HANNAH
There’s a new babysitter watching the baby while I’m here and I got a note at the break to call
and I immediately felt terror because six months ago there was an accident that threatened his
life.
ERHARD
You understand that the terror is of no value to her? You sympathize with the terror. When you
leave here you’ll be a little more ruthless than you are now. You’ll be concerned for what em-
powers people, not for sympathizing with their weaknesses. No empowerment in terror.
HANNAH
I had lost closeness with him. It was more about clinging, and I saw that it was more about
terror.
ERHARD
Major issues like parenting or confronting death generate the most persistent stories. The things
that are real close to us are hard not to be stupid about. It’s hard to be with that people do die.
And you are going to die. And that’s hard to be with. The more dramatic the soap opera is the
easier it is to get drawn into it and not be able to distinguish the story from what happened.
MAX
I’m here because I want my life to stop being an emergency, in my personal and professional
life. I am an upset waiting to happen.
ERHARD
Some of you are an argument waiting to happen. You’re waiting for the occasion to act out the
argument.
MAX
Turning away from my story to what happened is like becoming an arbitrator. It helps me get
away from my guilt.
ERHARD
If guilt were useful, I would say have a lot of it. Listen up here! This is another one of those
things you want to get. Feeling guilty makes it all right that you did something. If you didn’t feel
guilty you’d be a bad person. That’s not terrible to be a bad person. No, it’s all right to do some-
thing as long as you feel guilty about it. Guilt is the salve we put on something that we did so
that we don’t have to be responsible for it. But you don’t know what I’m talking about because
you don’t know the diff erence between guilt and responsibility at this point. Max?
If I am correct in arguing that Heidegger
conceives philosophy as basically rhetorical,
some revision in our conception of rhetoric
is called for. . . its purpose is not to incite its
hearer to action—even the action of adopting
some specific belief. Instead, rhetoric totally
reorients the hearer; if he listens to it he is in
a position to abandon an inauthentic life in
favor of an authentic one. (“Rhetoric” 68)
“
On this view, the truth of philosophy is intimately infused with
its communicability: “discovery, communication, and rhetoric all
collapse into a unitary philosophical act” (“Truth” 76). Further,
communicability is manifested as evocation: “The only way to tell
whether what I have is a truth or a falsehood,” said Johnstone, “is
to contemplate its evocative power.” And rhetoric, he added, is “the
art of evocation” (“Truth” 76).
Finally, Johnstone’s discussion of Heidegger raises a third issue
which will be particularly relevant in our analysis of The Forum: that
is the question of the appropriate rhetorical style for addressing an

MAX
The story is that I joined the service, and went to Vietnam. And my welcome home isn’t what
I expected. What happened was, I went to war and came back alive. Same as any other war,
there’s...it’s cleared up a lot of issues to look at it as what happened rather than my story in
relation to my coming home.
ERHARD (with emphasis)
Listen up! Vietnam’s a great, great story. Lot of people badly, badly fucked up by the story. Notice
I didn’t say by what happened? Lots of people profoundly disabled by the story. Lot of freedom
for people to start to distinguish the story from what happened. Thanks Max.
Erhard shifted his tone, calling attention to the process they had been engaged in: they had devel-
oped a number of distinctions as tools for their inquiry.
ERHARD
We’re going to get these tools sharpened up as we proceed. Your questions are useful. You notice
I’ve done most of what I’ve done out of people’s speaking. This is not a lecture, that’s why we
call it The Forum. This is a dialogue. My job is to manage the dialogue, not to lecture. I have
no pipeline to the truth. No one is asking you to believe anything that is said in here. But I’m
asking you to think about it. That’s diff erent from “reject” or “accept” it. Instead, see what the
world looks like standing in that idea. It doesn’t matter whether you agree or not. To tell the
truth, I’m not that impressed with you yet, to care whether you agree or not. I do want to hear
what you have to say. I’m not interested in your agreement or approval, or endorsement. I am
interested in you looking at what we’re saying here, to think about it yourself. And the way I’d
like you to do that is to not judge it or evaluate it to see if it fi ts with what you already think. If
I say anything that fi ts with what you already think, you shouldn’t be here. You can forget all
that. Anything I say that fi ts with what you already think: that’s not The Forum. Only what I
say that doesn’t fi t with the stuff  you think, that provokes you to think and see things in a new
way: that’s what’s valuable. But this isn’t the truth either. I don’t know about the truth. I know
how to talk so that people have new possibility in their life. If you talk with me, you can bet that
you’ll walk away with a new possibility in your life.
Now he introduced a new way to address what has already been the subject of the discussion.
ERHARD (continuing)
We’re going to talk about existence. That’s what we’ve been talking about. It’s hard to talk about.
It’s hard to pick yourself up by your own bootstraps. It’s got to exist to talk about it. If you’re go-
ing to question existence—talk about existence—it’s got to exist to talk about it. The word for a
concern for existence is ontology. And the reason I bring up that fancy sounding word is I want
you to know The Forum is not psychological. Most people can’t tell the diff erence. Psychology
is pervasive in our culture. The structure for interpretation for most people in this culture is psy-
chological. We’re all amateur psychologists. You see everything through a psychological lens.
untransformed audience whom one intends, through one’s rhetorical
transactions, to transform. Johnstone stated the problem this way:
Heidegger’s entire position is specifically
committed to the task of awakening phi-
listines from their ontological slumber
. . . . Das Man [the “they,” the philistine, the
untransformed] expects to be told in plain En-
glish what he can in fact come to understand
only by being awakened. But because Heide-
gger’s entire thrust is toward the awakening
of das Man he cannot reject as a mere philis-
tine the man who fails to understand him. In
Heidegger’s own terms, he is not successful
until he has reached the philistine. Hence in
a sense there are no philistines at all for him.
(“Rhetoric” 68)
“
How does one awaken people from a debilitating slumber if
they resist the process which is necessary for their awakening?
This question, as we will show, is a central one for the rhetorical
process of The Forum. ■
“
Only what I say that doesn’t fit with stuff
you think, that provokes you to think and
see things in a new way: that’s what’s
valuable.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (pausing to wake a participant who was nodding off )
It’s okay to sleep in here if you can do it bolt upright with your eyes open.
(returning to his topic)
Ontology is the diff erence between knowing how to play tennis and being a tennis player. They
don’t teach this in school for the most part, and when they do, they do it badly for the most part.
An ontological approach—that is to say, a concern-for-being approach—has got a lot of room in
it because it’s something we haven’t engaged in very much. The point is, there’s a lot of room
in a new realm. The psychological approach is one we’ve pushed really hard. And I want to be
clear I’m not denigrating it. And that’s not our approach.
(moving to one of the blackboards)
So far, we’ve distinguished two realms of existence. A phenomenon can exist in the realm of
story and it can exist in the realm of what happened.
Erhard drew two circles on the board: in the left circle he wrote the word  “Story,” and in the right he
wrote “What Happened.”
ERHARD (indicating the left circle)
Max gave us a good example. There’s the story of Vietnam and that’s here. And there’s what
happened, and that’s here.
(indicating the right circle in which he wrote “what happened”)
We’re going to see what happens when you begin to distinguish these two. You’re going to see
the impact it has on your ability and state of being to distinguish Vietnam “the story” and Viet-
nam “the what happened.” You can apply the demonstration anywhere. We need to talk about
thinking. Listen up. This is hard. Human beings have the notion that they think. Or—I might
as well introduce this—they are that they think. They be like they’re thinking. And there is
something happening. You and I call that “I think.” Here’s an exercise to tell if you’re thinking.
I’m going to shut up and you’re going to stop thinking.
(pausing for about fi fteen seconds)
You didn’t make it, did you? Nobody ever does, because it’s not you thinking. If you were
thinking then you could stop thinking. It is thinking, and you are having the thoughts it thinks.
t
Which is true? The old way of saying it or the way I said it? That’s not the point. I told you,
I don’t know the truth. I’m saying there’s something empowering about this, in the recogni-
tion that you don’t think. Like: “Hmm. I’m not thinking. It’s thinking, and I’m having those
thoughts.” What comes up when you think this way is the possibility of actually thinking.
Thinking is a process independent of those thoughts. Thinking is something like sitting with,
or more precisely something like dwelling in. It’s not like fi guring it out. You see, I asked you to
g
dwell in the possibility that it’s not you thinking.
(pausing again to address a number of people in the room who were getting sleepy)
It always happens about now. Thinking about thinking puts you to sleep. Thinking wakes you
g
up. Thinking is when you have to break your mind—though not all of that is thinking. Some of
it is bullshit.
“
It is thinking, and you are having the thoughts
t
it thinks. . . . Thinking is something like
sitting with, or more precisely something like
dwelling in. It’s not like figuring it out.
Forum Day One: Session Two
39
(turning to The Forum Supervisor)
Julie, would you ask Eric to get the Heidegger books out of my room.
(returning to the blackboard, and pointing to the circle labeled “story”)
I want to take back making this bad. What’s disempowering is not the story, what’s disempow-
ering is when you collapse “what happened” with the “story” and you can’t distinguish the story
from what happened. You can’t distinguish because you’ve got this mush, this mess, this swamp
of what happened and the story mixed together. The two need to be distinct. What does distinct
mean? It means existing then on their own, being there of themselves. It’s possible for Vietnam
to exist as a story and it’s possible for Vietnam to exist as a what happened. They’re two distinct
realms of existence. Sometimes the story is appropriate, sometimes what happened is appropri-
ate. What’s never appropriate is when these two distinctions get collapsed.
As this conversation developed, Erhard added other terms to his blackboard model. In the right
circle, below “what happened,” he wrote “presence” and “I’m late.” In the other, below “story,” was
written “concept” and “reasons.”
ERHARD
Confusing what happened with your story about it is like ordering steak and then mixing the
steak with the menu. Most people think life is sour because they’ve been eating the menu for
so long, they don’t recognize reading the menu. You should not say “I love you” to people. You
should say, “I live with the concept ‘I love you.’” Love as a concept is sometimes important, but
t
it isn’t the same as love as a presence. What falls out of my mouth when I say “chair” is a con-
cept. It’s not a chair—but it’s useful. Just separating the two domains of existence in any area of
your life will leave you with more power in that area. For this to work, try it on in your own life.
This is not the truth. Try it on. If it works, good; if not, throw it away.
At this point, The Forum Supervisor brought Erhard a copy of Heidegger’s What is Called Thinking?
(1968, pages 76-77). He spent a minute looking for the passage he wanted, and fi nally turned back
to her.
ERHARD
This is the wrong copy. This is not the copy I can fi nd things in. I have two marked copies and I
can fi nd things in one and not the other.
Julie brought up the correct copy.
ERHARD (beginning to read)
“People still hold the view that what is handed down to us by tradition is what in reality lies
behind us—while in fact it comes toward us because we are its captives and destined to it.”

وجود
نه دلایل ، هیچ کس دیگری و هیچ چیز دیگری. و شما دلایلی دارید. منظور من این است
مردم الاغ خود را از یک سوراخ در زمین نمی شناسند. مردم نمی دانند چه چیزی آنها را در آن قرار داده است
صندلی اگر با این ایده که تحت فشار قرار گرفته اید گیر کرده اید ، من می خواهم شما را از اینجا خارج کنید. من می روم
برای گفتن چیزهای زیادی در اینجا و شما فقط می خواهید آنها را بدست آورید. من می دانم که امروز شما هستید
تقریباً چیزی را که می گویم به دست می آورم ، زیرا می خواهید آن را به زبانی که در آن هستید قرار دهید
ساکن مانند "باید". من به زبان باید زندگی نمی کنم. اینجا کاملاً واضح است. من هستم
از شما سؤال می کند که چه کسی در مقبره گرانت دفن شده است. این سخت نیست شما خود را اینجا گذاشتید. یک شرکت کننده در مورد یکی از دوستانش که می خواست انجمن را انجام دهد ، سوالی را مطرح کرد. او مرد را توصیف کرد. شرکت کننده
آیا او احساس فشار می کند؟ درز
بله ، زیرا او یک لاله است. شرکت کننده (می خندد)
بله ، این درست است درز
می بینید ، نمی توانید به افرادی که مستقیم هستند فشار بیاورید. آنها پاسخ های روشنی مانند "نه" یا
"با من تماس نگیر." من مردم را دعوت می کنم. من می خواهم روشن باشم که منظور من از یک دعوت چیست. یک دعوت
برای من همیشه قدرت کاهش آن را با خود حمل می کند. ارهارد سکو را سوار کرد و استراحت را اعلام کرد. با این حال ، او گفت ، "در انجمن وجود دارد
بدون وقفه ، "بنابراین او به شرکت کنندگان تکلیف داد. Erhard
تکالیف در طول استراحت این است که "داستان" خود را از "چه اتفاقی افتاده" مرتب کنید. بیشتر مردم
در داستان زندگی کنید و در آنچه اتفاق افتاده زندگی نکنید. و چیزی که از آن استفاده می کند وجود دارد
درباره زندگی در داستان به جای زندگی در آنچه اتفاق افتاده است. مشکل این است که شما هستید
پرتاب شده - مثل همیشه همیشه - شما به داستان پرتاب می شوید. شما به داستان معتاد هستید. "مردم من را دوست ندارند" و "توهین" هرگز اتفاق نمی افتد. من قصد دارم توهین آمیز را نشان دهم. من می خواهم به شما توهین کنم: من به شما توهین می کنم. برای اولین بار در زندگی خود اکنون به عنوان یک مورد توهین شده است
چه اتفاقی افتاد همه اوقات دیگر ، کسی چیزی گفت ، و شما توهین کردید. مردم دارند
حرف
گفت شما تند و تیز هستید. اما این کسی است که می گوید "شما تند و تیز هستید." توهین یک داستان بود. حرف
با انجام تکالیف ، Erhard به نام جولی ، سرپرست انجمن ، به تریبون. درز
جولی شخصی است که این موضوع را به اندازه کافی سازمان یافته نگه می دارد تا بتواند اتفاق بیفتد. بنابراین همکاری شما
با او به نفع شماست. erhard (ادامه)
روز اول انجمن: جلسه یک
31
بعد از اینکه ارهارد از اتاق خارج شد ، جولی درخواست کرد که به دلیل اندازه گروه ، همه شرکت کنندگان باید
به هتل احترام بگذارید. وی به دستیاران اشاره کرد که می توانند شرکت کنندگان را به پرداخت تلفن راهنمایی کنند
و حمام وی گفت: "ما درخواست می کنیم که شما در این استراحت بخورید." "اگر باید برای پزشکی غذا بخورید
دلایل ، لطفاً وس را ببینید ، "یکی از دو رهبر انجمن که به Erhard کمک می کرد. سرانجام او
چهار سرپرست انجمن دیگر که با او کار می کردند ، و در دسترس بودند
به س questions الات آنها پاسخ دهید. سرانجام ، همانطور که او قبل از هر استراحت ، نام شرکت کنندگان را خواند
که در طول جلسه پیام های تلفنی دریافت کرده بودند. این انجمن ساعت 12:40 بعد از ظهر برای استراحت به تعویق افتاد. 32
وجود
نکات: تمایزهای هستی شناختی
این انجمن از طریق توسعه در گفتگو با آنچه ورنر به نتیجه می رسد حاصل می شود
Erhard تمایز قائل می شود. در آموزش سنتی ، مستقر در یک مدل معرفت شناختی
که در آن هدف افزایش یا تقویت آنچه شناخته شده است ، اطلاعات - مفهوم ،
ایده ها ، فرآیندها - از طریق تعریف و توضیح ارتباط برقرار می شوند. fo-
با این حال ، رم یک الگوی هستی شناختی از آموزش و پرورش را ایجاد می کند ، که در آن هدف نیست
افزایش دانش اما تجربه وجود. در این مدل ، عناصر
محتوای دوره متمایز است. ماهیت تمایزها به طور طولانی توسط Erhard بعداً مورد بررسی قرار می گیرد
انجمن. اما در اینجا ، اوایل صبح اول ، توسعه تمایزها
آماده در حال انجام Erhard در حال استفاده از جنبه ای از روش خود است که ،
به گفته مارتین هایدگر ، برای ارتباطات هستی شناختی اساسی است: استفاده از
نکات مربوط به برقراری ارتباط با آنچه که مستقیماً نمی توان گفت ، از این طریق دسترسی به آن را فراهم می کند
محتوا به عنوان زندگی می کرد نه صرفاً درک شده. هایدگر ایده اشاره را به عنوان راهی برای برقراری ارتباط در بودن معرفی کرد
مقاله او در سال 1959 ، "گفتگوی در مورد زبان" (در جغد) ، که گزارشی از آن را ارائه می دهد
گفتگوی او با یک محقق ژاپنی که علاقه خود را به هستی شناختی به اشتراک گذاشت
استعلام تعامل ، که به شکل یک متن ارائه شده است ، به عنوان یک باشکوه اتفاق می افتد
رقص مکالمه ، یک مینوت زبانی. هر حرکت با احتیاط انجام می شود ، بنابراین
تعامل در بعضی مواقع با فواصل فاش کننده انجام می شود. در یک لحظه هاید-
Gger (که در حساب به عنوان پرس و جو گفته می شود) یک سؤال را مطرح می کند - "آیا شما وارد شده اید
زبان شما کلمه ای برای آنچه ما زبان می نامیم؟ " - که محقق به آن وارد می شود
یک پاسخ آزمایشی تنها پس از بیست و سه صفحه از دور زدن متفکرانه در
و در اطراف موضوع در پاسخ به اظهارات ژاپنی ها در مورد "موجود اساسی" زبان ،
هایدگر به توصیف اغلب زبان خود از زبان "خانه" اشاره می کند
بودن. " او می گوید ، این عبارت "به ماهیت زبان اشاره می کند" ("DL" در OWL
26) با ادامه گفتگوی این دو مرد ، توجه فوق العاده ای که داده می شود
به هر کلمه احترام به ماهیت نکات را نشان می دهد. نکات ، هایدگر مشاهده می کند ،
"متعلق به یک قلمرو کاملاً متفاوت از واقعیت ... آنها مبهم هستند.
به ما آنها دور می شوند. آنها ما را به سمت آن چیزی که از آن به طور غیر منتظره ای استفاده می کنند ، می دانند
خود را به سمت ما تحمل کنید "(" DL "در OWL 26). در گفتگوی خود با محقق ژاپنی ، هایدگر متمایز است
اشاره ، یعنی اینکه او به ماهیت نکات اشاره می کند. توسعه انجمن-
تمایزها نیز به همین ترتیب فرایندی از اشاره است. جلسه یک بازه
در اشاره ، کلمات به گونه ای صحبت می شوند که "هر کلمه در هر مورد است
با توجه به وزن کامل آن که اغلب پنهان است - "(" DL "در جغد 31). آنچه گفته نمی شود ، اما
در پس زمینه ابلاغ شده است ، مجاز به بازگرداندن است. در این روش یک فضا است
مجاز به توسعه هر حرف:
[Inquirer]: نکات به وسیع ترین حوزه ای که در آن نوسان دارد نیاز دارد. بشر بشر [ژاپنی] :. بشر بشر جایی که فانی ها فقط به آرامی به آنجا می روند. [Inquirer]: این همان چیزی است که زبان ما آن را "دریغ" می نامد. انجام شده است
راستی وقتی کندی بر احترام خجالتی استوار است. و بنابراین من نمی خواهم
با ترغیب شما بیش از حد ، تردید خود را مزاحم کنید. [ژاپنی]: شما در تلاش برای گفتن من برای من مفیدتر هستید
کلمه از آنچه می توانید بدانید ("DL" در جغد 27-28)
علاوه بر این ، اگرچه هر تمایز دارای موضوع موضوع خود است - در این گفتگو ،
موضوع ماهیت زبان است - در توسعه تمایزات هدف رسیدن به آن نیست
مفصل کلامی صحیح از موضوع. در مقابل ، هدف این است که از چنین مواردی جلوگیری شود
وضوح:
[ژاپنی]: ما ژاپنی ها فکر نمی کنیم اگر گفتگو عجیب باشد
آنچه را که واقعاً در نظر گرفته شده است ، یا حتی آن را ترمیم می کند
بازگشت به نگه داشتن غیرقابل توصیف. [Inquirer]: من به اعتقاد من بخشی از هر گفتگو است که
بین موجودات تفکر خوب معلوم شده است. گویی از خودش است
توافق ، می تواند مراقبت کند که چیزی غیرقابل توصیف نیست
فقط از بین نمی رود ، بلکه نیروی جمع آوری خود را تا کنون به نمایش می گذارد
در جریان گفتگو با درخشش بیشتری. ("DL" در جغد 13)
در این گفتگو ، هایدگر و دانشمند ژاپنی ممکن است به عنوان دیده شوند
تصویب روش انجمن: توسعه دیالوگ از تمایزها
از طریق فرآیند اشاره. بودن نمی تواند کلامی باشد. بودن در زبان است ، اما
این در کلماتی نیست که گفته می شود. در پس زمینه ناگفته زندگی می کند ، و در
مکالمه ای برای وجود ، آن پیش زمینه باید موجود باشد. نکات یک است
فرم مناسب برای آوردن پیش زمینه برای حضور زیرا آنها ما را هدایت می کنند
توجه به چیزی که ما متوجه آن نشده بودیم ، چیزی که آنها در همان هستند
زمان برای دیدار با ما. اشاره هستی شناختی یک شکل آسان برای ارتباط با استاد نیست و توسط
توصیف آن در اینجا به عنوان عنصر "روش شناسی" انجمن ، ما افتاده ایم
طعمه یکی از مشکلات آن. وقتی هایدگر به محقق ژاپنی می گوید که تماس می گیرد
"
"
روز اول انجمن: جلسه یک بازه

زبان "خانه هستی" به "اشاره به ماهیت زبان" ، محقق می دهد
بلافاصله این خطر را تشخیص می دهد: "من می ترسم که" خانه بودن "خود را یک اشاره بنامم
ممکن است من و شما را وسوسه کنیم تا مفهوم اشاره را به یک مفهوم راهنما در توضیح دهیم
که ما همه چیز را جمع می کنیم "(" DL "در OWL). هایدگر موافقت می کند ، اما اضافه می کند
از آن زمان که این خطا "هرگز به معنای مستثنی بودن" نمی توان از آن جلوگیری کرد
"نحوه بازنمایی مفهومی خود را به راحتی در هر
نوع تجربه انسانی "(" DL "در OWL 25) یک مشاهده مربوطه توسط نویسنده ارشد: در طول سالهای مشارکت من
کار Erhard ، تمایز تمایزها همچنان منبع فاشانا باقی مانده است-
برای من ، چالش و حتی رمز و راز. من مکالمات بین
رهبران انجمن - افرادی که توسعه تمایز برای آنها مهم است
تمرین حرفه ای- که در آن صحبت ها به عنوان نوعی کوتاه برای من اتفاق افتاد
دست عناصر تعامل روزمره - ثبات ، انتقال ، اتصالات - به نظر می رسد
گم شدن در یک مناسبت ، بیانیه ای توسط یک رهبر تالار گفتگوی این موضوع دوباره
پاسخ از دیگری: "شما آن را توضیح می دهید. آن را متمایز کنید." من خودم را پیدا کردم
برای تشخیص تفاوت ذکر شده. اشاره گسترده ای در مورد ماهیت تمایز در کارهای بعدی هایدگر ،
جایی که او توجه خود را به طور فزاینده ای به امکانات هستی شناختی هنر تبدیل کرد ، و
به طور خاص شعر. به گفته وی ، شعر گفتن پروژکتور است - یعنی نوعی گفته
که با صحبت کردن با ناگفته ، پاکسازی را برای شما فراهم می کند. "گفتن پروژکتور
در حال گفتن است که ، در آماده سازی قابل بیان ، همزمان غیر قابل قبول را به ارمغان می آورد
چنین به دنیایی "(" OWA "در PLT 71). اما چنین جمله ای محدود به صحبت کردن نیست
از شاعر ، زیرا "خود زبان به معنای اساسی شعر است" ("OWA" در PLT
72) در واقع ، "زبان روزمره شعر فراموش شده و استفاده شده است ، که از آنجا آنجا است
دیگر به سختی تماس می گیرد. "
فکر (PLT 4). فکر مجرد هایدگر سوال بودن بود. مشابه
تک ذهنیت شاعر را توصیف می کند ، بنابراین توضیحات هایدگر از
رابطه شاعر با غیر قابل قبول مفید است:
هر شاعر بزرگ شعر خود را از یک تک آهنگ خلق می کند
فقط اظهارات شاعرانه. بشر بشر بشر اظهارات شاعر باقی مانده است
ناگفته هیچ یک از اشعار فردی او ، و کلیت آنها ،
همه را می گوید با این وجود ، هر شعر از کل صحبت می کند
از یک جمله واحد ، و در هر مورد این را می گوید
بیانیه ("LP" در OWL 160)
"
بنابراین همه نوشتن هایدگر و همه کارهای ورنر ارهارد ، و همچنین همه
شعر دیکینسون یا ریلکه یا والاس استیونز ، ممکن است به عنوان اجساد نکات برای آن دیده شود
جمله آنچه در اصل غیرقابل تحمل است. 34
وجود
در طول چهل دقیقه ای ، اظهارات روی دو تخته گچ نوشته شده بود. در یکی:
"وعده انجمن: شما می توانید چیزی خارج از انجمن داشته باشید که مایل به تحمل آن هستید
بدست آمده است. " در مورد دوم: "تعهد کار تحول است: آوردن a
دستیابی به موفقیت در امکان بودن برای انسان. "
با از سرگیری این انجمن ، ارهارد با یک سؤال شروع شد. درز
چه اتفاقی افتاد که شما در حال بررسی تفاوت بین داستان خود و چه مواردی بود
قلم؟ شرکت کننده
فهمیدم که نمی خواهم با داستانهایم مقابله کنم. درز
زندگی در نوعی ناخودآگاه ممکن است که معمولاً آن را ناخودآگاه نمی نامیم
زیرا ما از بین نرفتیم. این یک ناخودآگاه است که به نظر می رسد در آنجا نیست. چه
شما نمی توانید با شما جلوگیری کنید. اگر آنچه را که اتفاق می افتد و داستان را لکه دار می کنید ، آن را
نوع شما را کمی بیهوش نگه می دارد ، زیرا لازم نیست با آن باشید. اما وقتی شروع می کنید
برای تمایز داستان از آنچه اتفاق افتاده است ، شما شروع به دیدن داستان به عنوان یک داستان می کنید ، و این طور نیست
از این طریق بسیار جذاب است ، آیا؟ و این چیزی است که کسی بیشتر از آن جلوگیری می کند. در آنجا
چیزهای زیادی خواهد بود که به اینجا می آیند که نمی خواهید با آنها باشید. این مفید است که با چه چیزی باشید
شما نمی خواهید با آن باشید. آنچه قبلاً آموخته اید با آن باشید و زنده بمانید-این نیست
در اینجا بسیار مفید خواهد بود ، این بخشی است که از حضور در اینجا خودداری کرده اید. چیز دیگری؟ خیلی ممنون همانطور که شرکت کنندگان به این سؤال پاسخ دادند ، Erhard با گسترش کمک های خود را متناسب کرد
تمایزاتی که او در اوایل روز معرفی کرده بود. جان
من هرگز نسخه همسرم را از داستان نحوه ازدواج ما دوست نداشته ام. درز
وقتی می توانید داستان شخص را به عنوان داستان آنها تشخیص دهید ، شروع به دسترسی به نسخه آنها می کنید
از داستان ، به طوری که شما با آنها گیر نکرده اید ، لازم نیست خود را استعفا دهید ، نسخه آنها
داستان شما به امکانات متفاوتی در داستان دسترسی دارید ، اما نه وقتی که آن را جمع کنید
با اتفاقی که افتاد جان
خیلی ناراحت شدم ، اتاق را ترک کردم و در حالی که داستان را از قسمت دیگری از خانه شنیدم ،
ناراحتی به سمت تمایل به خارج شدن از ازدواج من چرخید. erhard (قطع)
شما فکر نکردید که از ازدواج خود خارج شوید. این در حال حاضر همیشه در محاصره است
توجیه بودن برای انسان. شما فکر می کنید ، "اوه ، این اتفاق افتاد و این باعث شد من فکر کنم من

وقتی می توانید داستان شخص را به عنوان تشخیص دهید

فلسفه به عنوان تبعید بلاغی
ما پیشنهاد می کنیم که این انجمن نمونه ای از هستی شناختی است
لفاظی ما در ابتدا تأکید می کنیم که این روزمره نیست
درک بلاغت به عنوان "بلاغت صرف" ، یعنی زبانی که
سطحی است و از اهداف جدی جدا شده است. لفاظی به عنوان
ما از این اصطلاح استفاده می کنیم از هر زبانی که برای تولید آن در نظر گرفته شده است
یک نتیجه در دنیای واقعی. بلاغت هستی شناختی در
قلمرو ناگفته زبان برای دسترسی به شنوندگان خود به
قلمرو هستی شناخت ارزش و عملکرد هستی شناختی
بلاغت در نوشتن بعدی هنری دبلیو جانستون یافت می شود ،
جونیور ، بنیانگذار مجله ، فلسفه و بلاغت. اوایل او
شغل ، جانستون معتقد بود که نقش فلسفی
بلاغت "رفتار با مخاطبان خود به عنوان یک شی" و هدف او بود
باید ترک یا ترک شود. " این به نظر می رسد که طوفان باران است.
ترک زندگی شما را ترک می کند. درست است که شما شخصاً با خودتان گفتگو کرده اید. اما این است
مثل خیس شدن در طوفان باران. (با تأکید)
من به این فکر نمی کنم این به من فکر می کند (مکث)
من شروع به صحبت کردن مثل مردم نمی کنم ، زیرا من می خواهم به آنچه من مربوط می شود دسترسی داشته باشم
مردم ندارند بنابراین من و شما شروع به اختراع زبانی می کنیم که به ما امکان دسترسی به آن را می دهد
چیزهایی که جالب یا مهم هستند که ما را در زندگی نگران می کند. این فکر شما نیست من می خواهم
شما باید فکر کنید که فکر می کند شما. شما فکرهایی دارید که در باران خیس می شوید-
طوفان من فقط از شما می خواهم که به روشی که قبلاً فکر نکرده اید فکر کنید. نوع
شخصی که شما با این تفکر داده می شود ، که افکار یا تفکر شما نیست. جان
چیزی که من متوجه شدم این بود که هر یک از ما داستانهای مختلفی در مورد چگونگی جمع شدن داریم. درز
شما نمی توانید سؤالاتی مانند "درست" بپرسید؟ در مورد داستانهای مردم هیچ چیزی به عنوان "درست" وجود ندارد
"
داستان. " "واقعی" و "داستان" با هم قرار نمی گیرند.
زیرا آنها شروع به اعتقاد به داستانهای خود می کنند. حتی بدتر ، شما شروع به اعتقاد به داستان شخص دیگری می کنید -
شما را در اپرا شخص دیگری به حامل نیزه تبدیل می کند. این روش خوبی برای زندگی نیست. جان
ما کاری را که انجام دادیم انجام دادیم و ازدواج کردیم. درز
چه کسی در مورد انتخاب ازدواج مشخص نیست؟ گفتگو در مورد اینکه چرا شما در
انجمن می تواند در شغل شما یا ازدواج شما نیز برای شما اعمال شود. تقریباً هیچ کس فکر نمی کند آنها
هر جایی هستند زیرا آنها خود را در آنجا قرار می دهند. اما همه خود را آنجا می گذارند. پس
شما این داستان را در مورد اینکه چرا آنجا هستید دریافت می کنید. هیچ قدرتی در داستان وجود ندارد ... شما در یک داستان زندگی می کنید
در مورد ازدواج من به شما متهم می کنم که شما در داستانی درباره ازدواج و زندگی زندگی می کنید
کیفیت ازدواج نشان می دهد که بخشی از آن توسط یک داستان ایجاد می شود. من نگفتم تو نمی کنی
ازدواج خوبی داشته باشید اما این محدود به یک جعبه خاص ، یک فضای خاص یا کیفیت است ، وقتی که
داستان. چه اتفاقی افتاد؟ شما ازدواج کردید سپس این کل داستان وجود دارد. و آنها متمایز هستند
از یکدیگر همین مورد در مورد همه چیز در زندگی صادق است. ببینید ، من و شما
زندگی در صورت زندگی از یک داستان ، زندگی می کردند. و بیشتر داستان است
بیشتر به دلایل شما تشکیل شده است. اما شما آن کار را کردید. این همان اتفاقی است که افتاد جان
به طور معمول من این را می دانم ، اما دیشب در مورد آن واضح نبودم. فراموش کردن آن بسیار آسان است. 36
وجود
"برای دستکاری مخاطبان خود برای تأمین توافق" بود "
("اقناع" 19). اما یک "چرخش" در تفکر جانستون او را به وجود آورد
به تأیید تا سال 1978 که "تمایز بین یافتن
حقیقت در فلسفه و یافتن وسایل بلاغی مناسب
برای تبلیغ آن نمی توان حفظ کرد "(" حقیقت "74). در دیگری
کلمات ، "حقیقت" همیشه و در حال حاضر بلاغی است ، هرگز قطع نشده است
از ارتباطات آن ، و در نتیجه یافتن "حقیقت" نیاز دارد
بهانه ای که لفاظی صرفاً مناسب است
لوازم جانبی که با آن توزیع می شود. دیدگاه جدید جانستون از فلسفه - سلطنت
رابطه در مفهوم Evocation بنا شده است: "حال من
دیدگاه این است که یک استدلال موفق در فلسفه مطرح است
در نظر گرفته شده است که پاسخی از یک نوع خاص را برانگیخته و بیرون می کشد
در مردی که به او خطاب شده است "(" حقیقت "75). جانستون استناد کرد
هایدگر به عنوان شواهدی برای این دیدگاه ، و توضیحات او در اینجا
استفاده از زبان هایدگر با درک ما از
هر دو فکر هایدگر و اورهارد:
درز
به همین دلیل ما به شما چیزی نمی دهیم که بخاطر بسپارید. شما فقط باید باشید. هانا
یک بچه نگهدار جدید در حالی که من اینجا هستم ، کودک را تماشا می کند و در استراحت یادداشت کردم تا تماس بگیرم
و من بلافاصله احساس وحشت کردم زیرا شش ماه پیش حادثه ای رخ داد که او را تهدید کرد
زندگی درز
شما می فهمید که ترور برای او هیچ ارزشی ندارد؟ شما با ترور همدردی می کنید. وقتی تو
ترک اینجا کمی بی رحمانه تر از الان خواهید بود. شما نگران این هستید که
مردم را قدرت می دهد ، نه به خاطر همدردی با نقاط ضعف خود. بدون توانمندسازی در ترور. هانا
من نزدیکی را با او از دست داده بودم. این بیشتر مربوط به چسبیدن بود ، و من دیدم که بیشتر در مورد آن است
ترور درز
موضوعات مهم مانند فرزندپروری یا مقابله با مرگ ، مداوم ترین داستان ها را ایجاد می کند. چیزها
که نزدیک به ما هستند سخت نیستیم که احمق نباشیم. سخت است که با آن مردم بمیرند. و شما می خواهید بمیرید. و این کار سخت است. اپرا صابون دراماتیک تر است
آسان تر این است که وارد آن شوید و نتوانید داستان را از آنچه اتفاق افتاده است متمایز کنید. حداکثر
من اینجا هستم زیرا می خواهم زندگی من در شرایط اضطراری متوقف شود ، در شخصی و حرفه ای من
زندگی من یک ناراحت هستم که منتظر اتفاق می افتد. درز
برخی از شما استدلالی هستید که منتظر اتفاق می افتد. شما منتظر این مناسبت هستید که
بحث حداکثر
دور کردن از داستان من به آنچه اتفاق افتاده است مانند داوری شدن است. این به من کمک می کند تا دریافت کنم
دور از گناه من درز
اگر گناه مفید بود ، می گویم مقدار زیادی از آن وجود دارد. اینجا گوش کن! این یکی دیگر از این موارد است
چیزهایی که می خواهید بدست آورید. احساس گناه باعث می شود که این کار را انجام دهید. اگر احساس نمی کردید
گناهکار شما آدم بدی خواهید بود. این شخص بدی نیست. نه ، این درست است که انجام دهیم-
چیز تا زمانی که در مورد آن احساس گناه کنید. گناه سالی است که ما روی آن کاری کردیم که چنین کردیم
که ما لازم نیست که مسئولیت آن را داشته باشیم. اما شما نمی دانید که من در مورد چه چیزی صحبت می کنم زیرا
شما در این مرحله تفاوت بین گناه و مسئولیت را نمی دانید. حداکثر؟ اگر من در استدلال در مورد هایدگر درست هستم
فلسفه را اساساً بلاغی تصور می کند ،
برخی از تجدید نظر در تصور ما از لفاظی
خواسته شده است بشر بشر هدف آن تحریک آن نیست
شنونده به عمل - حتی اقدام به تصویب
برخی از اعتقادات خاص در عوض ، بلاغت کاملاً
مجدداً شنونده را تغییر دهید. اگر او به آن گوش کند ، در آن است
موقعیتی برای رها کردن یک زندگی غیر معتبر در
طرفداری از یک معتبر. ("بلاغت" 68)
"
در مورد این دیدگاه ، حقیقت فلسفه از نزدیک با آن تزریق می شود
ارتباط پذیری آن: "کشف ، ارتباطات و بلاغت همه
سقوط به یک عمل فلسفی واحد "(" حقیقت "76)
ارتباط پذیری به عنوان Evocation آشکار می شود: "تنها راه برای گفتن
چه چیزی من یک حقیقت است یا یک باطل است. "
به فکر قدرت تحریک آمیز آن است. " وی افزود و بلاغت "این است
Art of Evocation "(" حقیقت "76). سرانجام ، بحث جانستون درباره هایدگر مسئله سوم را مطرح می کند
که به ویژه در تجزیه و تحلیل ما از انجمن مهم خواهد بود:
آیا سوال از سبک بلاغی مناسب برای پرداختن به یک
روز اول انجمن: جلسه دو
37
حداکثر
داستان این است که من به سرویس پیوستم و به ویتنام رفتم. و خانه خوش آمدید من چیزی نیست
انتظار داشتم اتفاقی که افتاد ، من به جنگ رفتم و زنده برگشتم. مانند هر جنگ دیگر ،
... وجود دارد که بسیاری از مسائل را پاک کرده است تا به عنوان آنچه اتفاق افتاده است به جای داستان من در آن نگاه کنید
رابطه با خانه من. erhard (با تأکید)
گوش کن ویتنام یک داستان عالی و عالی است. بسیاری از افراد به شدت ، بد از داستان لعنتی. اخطار
من با آنچه اتفاق افتاده نگفتم؟ بسیاری از افراد عمیقاً از داستان غیرفعال می شوند. آزادی زیاد
برای اینکه مردم شروع به تشخیص داستان از آنچه اتفاق افتاده است. با تشکر از حداکثر ارهارد لحن خود را تغییر داد و توجه به روندی را که درگیر شده بودند ، جلب کرد: آنها توسعه یافته بودند
به عنوان ابزاری برای پرسش خود ، تعدادی از تمایزات را انتخاب کردند. درز
ما می خواهیم این ابزارها را با ادامه کار تیز کنیم. سوالات شما مفید است توجه می کنید
من بیشتر کارهایی را که من از صحبت کردن مردم انجام داده ام انجام داده ام. این یک سخنرانی نیست ، به همین دلیل ما
آن را به انجمن بنامید. این یک گفتگو است. کار من مدیریت گفتگو است نه سخنرانی. من دارم
خط لوله ای برای حقیقت نیست. هیچ کس از شما نمی خواهد هر چیزی را که در اینجا گفته می شود باور کنید. اما من هستم
از شما می خواهد که در مورد آن فکر کنید. این از "رد" یا "قبول" آن تفاوت دارد. در عوض ، ببینید چه چیزی
به نظر می رسد جهان در آن ایده ایستاده است. فرقی نمی کند موافق باشید یا نه. برای گفتن
حقیقت ، من هنوز تحت تأثیر شما قرار نگرفته ام ، تا اهمیت دهم که موافق باشید یا نه. من می خواهم بشنوم
آنچه شما باید بگویید من به توافق یا تأیید یا تأیید شما علاقه ای ندارم. من هستم
به شما علاقه مند است که به آنچه در اینجا می گوییم نگاه کنید ، خودتان در مورد آن فکر کنید. و راهی که من
مانند شما که این کار را انجام دهید این است که در مورد آن قضاوت نکنید یا آن را ارزیابی کنید تا ببینید که آیا با آنچه قبلاً فکر می کنید ، است یا خیر. اگر
من هر چیزی را می گویم که با آنچه فکر می کنید ، نباید اینجا باشید. شما می توانید همه را فراموش کنید
که هر چیزی که من می گویم با آنچه شما فکر می کنید: این انجمن نیست. فقط آنچه من
بگویید که با چیزهایی که فکر می کنید نیست ، این باعث می شود که شما فکر کنید و چیزها را در یک چیز جدید ببینید
راه: این ارزشمند است اما این حقیقت هم نیست. من در مورد حقیقت نمی دانم. من می دانم
چگونه صحبت کنیم تا مردم در زندگی خود امکان جدیدی داشته باشند. اگر با من صحبت می کنید ، می توانید شرط بندی کنید
شما با یک امکان جدید در زندگی خود دور خواهید شد. اکنون او روش جدیدی را برای پرداختن به آنچه قبلاً موضوع بحث بوده است ، معرفی کرد. erhard (ادامه)
ما می خواهیم در مورد وجود صحبت کنیم. این همان چیزی است که ما در مورد آن صحبت کرده ایم. صحبت کردن در مورد آن دشوار است. انتخاب خود توسط بوت استرپ های شخصی خود دشوار است. باید در مورد آن صحبت کنیم. اگر بروید-
برای سؤال از وجود - در مورد وجود - باید در مورد آن صحبت کنیم. کلمه برای
نگرانی از وجود هستی شناسی است. و دلیل اینکه من آن کلمه صدایی فانتزی را مطرح کردم این است که من می خواهم
شما می دانید که این انجمن روانی نیست. بیشتر مردم نمی توانند تفاوتهای مختلفی را بیان کنند. روانشناسی
در فرهنگ ما فراگیر است. ساختار تفسیر برای بیشتر افراد در این فرهنگ Psy-
chological همه ما روانشناسان آماتور هستیم. شما همه چیز را از طریق یک لنز روانشناختی می بینید. مخاطبان غیرقابل تركی كه كسی در نظر دارد ، از طریق بلاغت شخص
معاملات ، برای تبدیل. جانستون این مشکل را از این طریق بیان کرد:
کل موقعیت هایدگر به طور خاص است
متعهد به وظیفه بیداری phi-
لیست از لجن هستی شناختی آنها
بشر بشر بشر بشر مرد داس ["آنها" ، فلسطین ،
غیرقانونی] انتظار دارد که به صورت ساده گفته شود
آنچه را که او در واقع می تواند درک کند
فقط با بیدار شدن اما چون هاید-
کل فشار گگر به سمت بیداری است
از مرد داس او نمی تواند به عنوان یک فیلیس صرفاً رد کند-
مردی را که نمی تواند او را درک کند ، بکشید. در
شرایط خود هایدگر ، او موفق نیست
تا اینکه به فلسطین رسید. از این رو در
این حس برای او به هیچ وجه فلسطین وجود ندارد. ("بلاغت" 68)
"
چگونه می توان مردم را از یک لجن ناتوان کننده بیدار کرد
آنها در برابر فرایندی که برای بیداری آنها لازم است مقاومت می کنند؟ این سوال ، همانطور که نشان خواهیم داد ، اصلی برای بلاغت است
روند انجمن. ■
"
فقط آنچه من می گویم که با چیزها مناسب نیست
شما فکر می کنید ، این باعث می شود شما فکر کنید و
چیزها را به روشی جدید ببینید: این همان چیزی است که وجود دارد

وجود
erhard (مکث برای بیدار کردن یک شرکت کننده که گره خورده بود)
خوب است که اگر می توانید آن را به صورت قائم با چشمان باز کنید ، در اینجا بخوابید. (بازگشت به موضوع او)
هستی شناسی تفاوت بین دانستن نحوه بازی تنیس و تنیسور بودن است. آنها
این کار را بیشتر در مدرسه آموزش ندهید ، و وقتی این کار را انجام می دهند ، بیشتر این کار را انجام می دهند. یک رویکرد هستی شناختی-یعنی یک رویکرد نگران کننده-
این به این دلیل است که این چیزی است که ما خیلی درگیر آن نشده ایم. نکته این است که اتاق زیادی وجود دارد
در یک قلمرو جدید رویکرد روانشناختی روشی است که ما واقعاً سخت فشار آورده ایم. و من می خواهم باشم
واضح است که من آن را نفی نمی کنم. و این رویکرد ما نیست (حرکت به یکی از تخته های سیاه)
تاکنون ، ما دو قلمرو وجود را متمایز کرده ایم. یک پدیده می تواند در قلمرو وجود داشته باشد
داستان و می تواند در قلمرو آنچه اتفاق افتاده است وجود داشته باشد. ارهارد دو دایره را روی صفحه کشید: در حلقه چپ او کلمه "داستان" را نوشت و در سمت راست او
نوشت: "چه اتفاقی افتاده است."
erhard (نشانگر دایره سمت چپ)
مکس مثال خوبی به ما داد. داستان ویتنام وجود دارد و اینجا است. و چه چیزی وجود دارد
اتفاق افتاد ، و این اینجا است. (نشانگر دایره درستی است که در آن "چه اتفاقی افتاده است")
ما می خواهیم ببینیم که وقتی شروع به تشخیص این دو می کنید چه اتفاقی می افتد. شما می خواهید ببینید
تأثیر آن بر توانایی و وضعیت شما در تمایز ویتنام "داستان" و ویت-
نام "آنچه اتفاق افتاده است." شما می توانید تظاهرات را در هر کجا اعمال کنید. ما باید در مورد آن صحبت کنیم
فکر کردن گوش کن این سخت است انسان این تصور را دارد که فکر می کنند. یا ممکن است
همچنین این را معرفی کنید - آنها فکر می کنند. آنها مثل این هستند که فکر می کنند. و وجود دارد
اتفاقی می افتد من و شما آن را "فکر می کنم" می نامیم. در اینجا یک تمرین وجود دارد که می گوید فکر می کنید. من می خواهم تعطیل شوم و شما قصد دارید دیگر فکر کنید. (مکث حدود ثانیه fi)
شما آن را درست نکردید ، آیا؟ هیچ کس هرگز این کار را انجام نمی دهد ، زیرا شما فکر نمی کنید. اگر بودی

کدام یک درست است؟ روش قدیمی گفتن آن یا روشی که من آن را گفتم؟ این نکته نیست من به شما گفتم ،
من حقیقت را نمی دانم. من می گویم چیزی در این مورد قدرتمند است ،
فکر نمی کنید. مانند: "هوم. من فکر نمی کنم. این فکر می کند ، و من آن را دارم
افکار. " آنچه که شما به این روش فکر می کنید ، فکر کردن در واقع فرایندی است که مستقل از آن افکار است.
یا به طور دقیق تر چیزی شبیه به خانه. می بینید ، من از شما خواستم
جف
در این احتمال که فکر نمی کنید فکر کنید. (مکث دوباره برای پرداختن به تعدادی از افراد اتاق که خواب آلودگی می کردند)

ering وقتی است که "چه اتفاقی افتاده است" را با "داستان" فرو می ریزید و نمی توانید داستان را متمایز کنید

وجود به عنوان یک داستان و امکان وجود ویتنام به عنوان آنچه اتفاق افتاده است وجود دارد. آنها دو متمایز هستند
