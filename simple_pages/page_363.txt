Forum Day Four: Session One
349
DENNIS
Sure I can buy that.
ERHARD
Grant is buried in Grant’s tomb, and that’s about how complex this whole thing is. Things are 
the way they are and things are not the way that they are not, and they are always like that and 
they don’t change.
DENNIS
See, I have a hard time... I want to believe, Werner... 
ERHARD
I appreciate that...
DENNIS
...but it’s like, I came here with some conceptions that... “Okay, I am here, because I feel fi ne. 
I am successful. There are certain things wrong I would like to fi x.” Sitting here, wanting to 
believe, but I’m hearing, “let it be.”
ERHARD
I never said “let it be.” That’s somebody else’s horseshit. I never said “let it be,” because you 
can’t do anything but let it be--and pretend that you’re doing something else. What I said is 
“what is, is, and what isn’t, isn’t.” That’s mine. That’s pretty goddamned safe. I’ll take on any-
body who wants to attack me on that one. 
DENNIS
No, I’m not trying to attack you...
ERHARD
No, no, I know you’re not trying to attack me. I did not mean to imply that, and I’m sorry if it 
sounded like I did.
DENNIS
No, I’m just trying...
ERHARD
You’re trying to hear bells. All you’re going to hear is simplicity.
DENNIS
Yeah, I guess I came here thinking that four days and three hours on the fi fth day is going to 
make a diff erence in my life. I just can’t go home and quit and say the rest will be history. You 
have to go back to your life.
