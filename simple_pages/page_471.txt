Forum Day Four: Session Three 457
AVRIL
And I think that’s where I get mucked up, you know, the risk: The “should” is so huge that I 
keep getting back into the mud with it. 
KIPP
That’s why nobody wants choice. It leaves them being responsible. It’s much easier to be used 
by whatever life gives you. 
AVRIL
Where I feel confused is, when you say “take what you got.” What I got is my husband, so then I 
think that...
KIPP
You don’t have your husband.
AVRIL
I have this marriage, this entanglement.
KIPP
What you’ve got is this question about your marriage. That’s what you’ve got.
AVRIL
That’s what I need to choose.
KIPP
That’s what you’ve got right now, right? This question about your marriage.
AVRIL
Right. I feel like I’ve had that for twelve years.
KIPP
That’s your drama, though. You’re pretty dramatic about the whole thing. I’m not trying to 
reduce what it is to be married, to love somebody and not have it go according to your dreams, 
and what comes along with that, but we’ve had a pretty straight conversation for four days, and 
we can kind of cut the drama pretty easily now: to get on with your life. If you didn’t have this 
question, this entanglement, what would you get on with? What’s the big payoff  in your life for 
all these histrionics? 
AVRIL
I feel like I’ve gotten on with it in every other area of my life except this one, and the payoff  is 
that I don’t count, or rather, that’s the racket.
