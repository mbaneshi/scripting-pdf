Forum Day Two: Session One

ERHARD
So, whatever it is you’re resisting, it’s exactly the same in its end result as what it is you’re
indulging. If I’m addicted to anger, I’m no more or less attached to anger than if I was resisting
anger. Clear about that part?
MIKE
I am clear about that part.
ERHARD
Good. Let’s go to the next part. By virtue of not being angry... You see, what being eff ective at re-
lating is about for Marsha, it’s about not being angry. So what’s the result of relating eff ectively?
MIKE
I’m lost.
ERHARD
You’re not lost. You’re intelligent. You’re clear that you don’t understand what I’m saying. Say-
ing you understand when you don’t is “lost.” Clear?
t
MIKE
I want to say yes, but... go ahead.
ERHARD
Is it clear that you aren’t lost?
MIKE
It’s clear that I don’t know what you are talking about right now.
ERHARD
Yeah. That’s pretty clear isn’t it? So you’re not lost. You’re clear.
MIKE
I got that.
ERHARD
Good. Now we’re going back to this business about “if I relate well in order to avoid anger,”
what is the result of my relating well?
MIKE
I’m avoiding the anger.
ERHARD
Perfect. Is there any satisfaction in that? Is that going to leave you whole?

SPEAKING BEING
MIKE
It’ll delay confronting the anger.
ERHARD
It might do that but that’s not my point. My point is that being well related with somebody
ought to be a source of fulfi llment and satisfaction, yes?
MIKE
That’s a presupposition.
ERHARD
Yeah: A fairly safe one. If you and I are well related, there ought to be a sense of being fulfi lled
by that.
MIKE
Okay.
ERHARD
But if you and I are well related in order to avoid being angry, the result of being well related
is not satisfaction and fulfi llment: it is avoiding being angry. So you can be well related all over
the place and it’s not going to leave you full of joy or profoundly satisfi ed. It’s going to leave you
having avoided anger. You won and they gave you the booby prize. Is that clearer?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
There are accomplished people who are not nurtured by their accomplishments, because they
are accomplished in order to not be something they’re avoiding being.
(to Mike)
Do you get that?
MIKE
Partially.
ERHARD
Okay, let’s get it completely clear.
MIKE
Okay.
“
But if you and I are well related in order to
avoid being angry, the result of being well
related is not satisfaction and fulfillment: it is
avoiding being angry.
