Forum Day Four: Session Three 481
occurs as going. See you and I think that the guy who hits the ball over the net in tennis all the time
has skill. No. That’s a guy for whom the ball comes over the net very slowly and very big. That’s the
diff erence between him and me. He does not have some property inside himself that I don’t have.
JERRY
So you’re using “occurs” as the way the ball is perceived? The way the ball is seen or perceived?
ERHARD
Yeah, I don’t like that and it’ll get you into trouble if you push it too far, but yes, that’s a correct
understanding. It’s not mere perception. It’s not mere seeing. It’s an ontological phenomenon,
not a physiological phenomenon. It’s the way the ball occurs. So here’s what I’ve said so far.
Your actions are not a correlate of “is.” Your actions and her actions and my actions and his
actions are all perfectly correlated to the occurring ball. And why some people look clumsy to
us is because we don’t realize their actions are correlated to the occurring ball; we think their
actions are correlated with the is ball. It is going a certain speed. It is in their sights for a certain
amount of time.
JERRY (laughing)
This sounds pretty simple to me now.
ERHARD
Yeah, it is.
JERRY
Everybody else have that?
ERHARD
Yeah, they got it listening to you.
JERRY
I guess my problem was I didn’t know what you meant by occurring and what you meant by is.
ERHARD
You and I don’t dwell in the distinction called “occurring.” You and I dwell in the distinction
called “is.”
JERRY
Why not?
ERHARD
A thing called stupidity.
JERRY
Kids dwell in occurring, don’t they?
being is an event—an event with language, and therefore very
diff erent from trees, but nevertheless a happening, like all of the
other beings in the world, where absence is always the background
accompaniment to presence. Nonexistence is the background for
your existence.
According to Heidegger scholar Charles Guignon, such a
world is what Heidegger was aiming to retrieve for human beings.
Guignon calls it an event ontology, an alternative to the substance
ontology that has dominated Western thinking, in which the world
is just a collection of things. Such a world of events may sound
tenuous and risky; but consider: might you, reborn anew in every
moment of now, be more alive to existence? Might such a world be
more vivid, more challenging, more engaging? Might living in that
world keep you on your toes, or on the edge of your seat?
Heidegger proposes that the reality we have imagined here
was what the world was like for the early Greeks. This is also the
nature of the transformation that occurs in The Forum, where
participants get Nothing as a liberating context for their lives. ■

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
They dwell in “is” too. Nobody coaches occurring. They coach is. They tell you how to hold the
racket.
JERRY
How about the guy who wrote the book Inner Tennis. He coaches occurring, right?
ERHARD (walking toward Jerry and then standing right in front of him)
He doesn’t talk about it that way, but he does “occurring.” What makes Tim Gallwey’s coaching
eff ective—Tim coaches a shift in the occurring; he’s not trying to change the behavior. No
matter how much I know how to behave, I’m going to behave as a correlate of the occurring.
I’m not going to behave like I know how to behave. That’s true about you because you didn’t
always behave the way your mother told you to behave. By the time I was fi ve years old, my
mother told me everything I needed to know about how to be a decent human being. I had all
the knowledge I needed. Didn’t make a damn bit of diff erence. I was a rat. You too. You tell
yourself what to do, but you don’t do it, do you?
JERRY
Sometimes.
ERHARD
Yeah. Sometimes. But you always, your actions are always correlated with the occurring of
the world. That dictionary fl ies through the air, your hands will move in a dance with that
dictionary, because your hands are correlated with the occurring of the world.
JERRY
Yeah, I believe that, but it sounds like I missed something.
ERHARD
Don’t believe. I want you to get it.
JERRY
Well it feels like I’m missing something, because you’re saying it like it’s a big deal.
ERHARD
Yeah, it is a big deal. I’ll tell you what the big deal about it is: Stop trying to change
yourself. Stop trying to put properties inside of yourself. Stop trying to get yourself to do
the right thing. Alter the way the world occurs for you, and your actions will naturally
alter. You get that?
JERRY
Yeah, I believe I get it.
