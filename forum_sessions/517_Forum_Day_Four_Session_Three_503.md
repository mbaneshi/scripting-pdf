Forum Day Four: Session Three 503
don’t have to risk much. You don’t have to put your lines out when you’re ugly. You all awake?
If you’re beautiful, you’ve got to put your lines out. You understand why?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Do you understand trolling?
JANE
Yeah.
(laughter)
ERHARD
Trolling is a game called being alive. And it’s as meaningful as everything else in life. Zero.
Therefore you’re free to play. And there are certain agreements in society about playing. And
society is weird, but that’s too bad: That’s what we got. I may not get a chance to talk to you
again tonight, and I want you to know how deeply grateful I am for your contribution to this
Forum. You’re really beautiful.
JANE
Thank you.
She sat to long applause from the group.
Erhard moved to the chalkboard, and drew three circles. The fi rst two he labeled “story” and “what
happened.”
ERHARD
Remember on the fi rst day, we drew these two circles. One was your “story” and the other
circle was “what happened.” So there was what happened, and there was your story about what
happened, and then we talked about the vicious circle where those two domains got collapsed,
and you couldn’t tell the diff erence between what happened and your story about what happened.
And you began to think that your story about what happened is what happened. And that makes
people suff er. Just like putting your hand on the gas stove makes you suff er. That’s why you
can’t trust psychology, because all of the then-known facts in psychology had been established
with experiments with rats and college sophomores, neither one of which might be human—I
don’t know about college sophomores, but I know that rats are not like human beings. And the
diff erence between a rat and a human being is a rat will stop crawling into the oven if it gets
burned, and human beings will keep crawling into the oven. Forever. Why? Because “it’s the right
fucking oven, and I believe in it.” And then we got more sophisticated and said there were two
realms of existence: that what existed, existed as a presence, and what existed, the same stuff , exists
as a concept. These are two distinct realms of existence, domains of existence.
mechanism of the “they” self, the two thinkers appear side-by-side,
but this is only a semblance. For Heidegger, one notable eff ect of
understanding the world as a source of resources is that humans
have surrendered their role as the self-certain ontologically centered
subject. Since standing-reserve is an “inclusive rubric,” it moves us
beyond the Cartesian subject-object model in which we have come to
conceptualize our relationship to things. Instead, says Dreyfus, “we are
passing from the subject-object stage to the stage in which the culture
is becoming, one might say, one big cybernetic system” (“Gaining”).
Clearly, this is not the overcoming of Cartesian subjectivity that the
early Heidegger of Being and Time and Erhard—from the est Training to
the present—have been working toward. It is not the opening for a new
possibility of Being for human beings. Instead:
As soon as what is unconcealed no longer
concerns man even as object, but exclusively
as standing-reserve, and man in the midst of
objectlessness is nothing but the orderer of the
standing-reserve, then he comes to the brink of
a very precipitous fall, that is, he comes to the
point where he himself will have to be taken as
standing-reserve. (“QCT” in BW 332, emphasis
added)
“
This precipitous fall, we off er, has already taken place: this is the
way of being human The Forum addresses in its participants from
the very beginning. Those seeking to improve, to acquire the tips
and techniques to overcome and change their lives for the better,
who take any morsel of wisdom and put it to use, all the better to
order it, but in the process they—we—unwittingly rob the truth,
as unconcealment, of its power—this is the way of being that self-
destructs against the bulwark of the Nothing the inquiry of The
Forum brings to presence.
Enframing
And so, we arrive at the final stage in the way modern technology
reveals the world: “the essence of modern technology,” says
Heidegger, “lies in enframing [Gestell]” (“QCT” in BW 328). This

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (indicating the “story” circle)
In this realm there are things like explanations.
(indicating the “what happened” circle)
And in this realm there are things like experience. So one is the experience and the other
is the explanation of the experience. This was the whole story at the time we discussed this
earlier. We were going backwards. We got to zero, we got to empty and meaningless. Now
we’re seeing that there are two sides to The Forum. The fi rst side is “What is the already
always being of human beings?” And the other side is “What is the possibility of being for
human beings?” Now you heard “What is the possibility of being for human beings” as the
something maybe, could I, might be, maybe, like some stupid image you got of yourself as
thin and sexy and young and rich, or whatever your silly notion is for your self. Holy. It fi ts
in there. The same crap.
(indicating the fi rst two circles)
That’s what you got born with. That’s what came with the package—those two domains. There’s
another domain.
(drawing a new circle to the left of the “what happened” circle)
It doesn’t come with the package. You don’t get it for free.
(indicating the “story” circle)
You can talk about that domain right here, but that’s talking about it. That’s like eating the
menu.
(indicating the third, still empty circle to the left of the “what happened” circle and of the “story”
circle)
A lot of people talking about this domain.
(indicating the “what happened” circle)
You can even have experiences of it. People who merely have the experience of it get weird. Lot
a weird people in this room, by the way. They gravitate to California.
(laughter)
People with the experience of that other domain: Makes them weird. They can’t get over it, so they
stay weird. They’ve got no mastery of the domain. They don’t dwell in the domain; they don’t come
from the domain. They don’t dwell in it, but they’ve touched it experientially. Everybody in the room
has had that experience. Everybody. Some of you haven’t had enough of that experience to be weird
yet, that’s all. You know that experience where you don’t have to eat, where you don’t have to go to
the bathroom, and you don’t have a home, and there’s nothing but what you’re doing. You’re not even
there, right? It’s like when you get out of the way, and there’s that thing that happens when you’re out
of the way? By the way, when do you come back? When it goes bad. Right away you’re right there:
“Oh shit!”
is the culmination, the gathering of the challenging-forth and
ordering, the box in which human beings as resources already
find themselves at this juncture in our history. To employ the
vernacular, the technological way of Being is a done deal: “The
actual threat has already aff licted man in his essence. . . . Thus the
question as to how we are to arrive at a relationship to the essence
of technology, asked in this way, always comes too late” (“QCT” in
BW 333, 329). In a 1966 interview with the German newsmagazine
Der Spiegel, asked what was missing in the world when, aft er all,
everything seemed to be functioning and production was at a
peak, Heidegger replied: “Everything is functioning. This is exactly
what is so uncanny, that everything is functioning and that the
functioning drives us more and more to even further functioning,
and that technology tears men loose from the earth and uproots
them” (in Zimmerman’s Heidegger’s Confrontation with Modernity
199, emphasis added). Thus uprooted, says Dreyfus, human
beings “become a resource to be used, and more importantly to be
enhanced, just like any other resource” (“Gaining”).
And yet, it is Erhard’s technology of transformation that brings
forth its participants to arrive at such a relationship to the essence
of technology, right in the midst of being torn loose from the earth,
used and enhanced as any resource would be, caught up in the
relentless logic of the in-order-to. Rather than turn away from the
technological way of being we are thrown to be, the inquiry of The
Forum directs its participants to come face-to-face with it, to own
up to it, to be in the trap that it is for human being. ■
