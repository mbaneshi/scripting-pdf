Forum Day Three: Session One

JANE
Seven or eight years old.
ERHARD
You’ve got an eight-year-old running a seventeen-year-old’s life. You know that?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Is it true that nobody likes you?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
You are “nobody likes you,” even though you know that’s irrational. But it wasn’t irrational for a 
eight-year-old, was it? 
JANE
No. 
ERHARD
If I told you a story like yours to a seventeen-year-old, you’d understand that makes sense for an 
eight-year-old to think that, right?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
But would you understand that in a seventeen-year-old woman?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
No, it’s not the thinking of a seventeen-year-old woman, is it?
JANE
Right.
ERHARD
You want to know about yourself that you put your identity together, you put your persona 
together. You built yourself. Your life will be a compensation for not being liked. And the way 
But Heidegger quickly pulls us up short here: on second
thought (and it is in the pattern of Heidegger’s thinking that there 
are many second thoughts for any proposal), are we really, in 
awakening an attunement, letting it be? On the contrary, Heideg-
ger suggests that attunements function best as themselves when 
they are not recognized as themselves. If, he asks,
t
“
we make an attunement conscious, come to know
of it and explicitly make the attunement itself into 
an object of knowledge, we achieve the contrary
of an awakening. The attunement is thereby pre-
cisely destroyed, or at least not intensified, but 
weakened and altered. (FCM 61)

Therefore, considering attunements as being asleep, and therefore 
to be awakened—since it may destroy the very phenomenon to
which we wish to attend—may not be the best path for inquiry; so
Heidegger proposes another direction for our thinking:
“ 
How oft en it happens, in a conversation among 
a group of people, that we are ‘not there,’ how
oft en we find that we were absent, albeit without
having fallen asleep. This not-being-there, this be-
ing-away [Weg-sein], has nothing at all to do with
consciousness in the usual sense. On the contrary, 
this not-being-there can be highly conscious. In 
such being absent we are precisely concerned 
with ourselves, or with something else. Yet this 
not-being-there is nonetheless a being-away. 
(FCM 63)
M
A human being can only be away because its being has the charac-
y
ter of being-there. As being-there, “a human being—insofar as he 
or she exists—is, in his or her being there, also always already and 
necessarily away in some manner” (FCM 63):
