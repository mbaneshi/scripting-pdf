SPEAKING BEING
ANGEL
Right.
ERHARD
You became that like Mike became stupid. It wasn’t something you decided, it wasn’t something 
you thought. You became that.
ANGEL
You want to hear something stupid? Being stupid isn’t good but being sensitive and caring is 
good.
ERHARD
But listen up. You didn’t quite get what I said. You actually became, gave yourself an identity,
called caring. Whatever caring you had got buried under that identity. You became a caring ma-
chine. You became a caring robot. And whatever authentic caring you had, whatever authentic 
feeling you had; that got obscured by the robot. You get what I’m saying? You know what it’s 
like to be married to a robot? Not good. This is not a good thing. Being related to a fucking
robot. Particularly when the robot looks like they might be good for something else, like a real
relationship. Did you hear what I just said?
ANGEL
Yes.
ERHARD
That caring act will get you plenty of relatedness, but it will never fulfi ll itself.
ANGEL
Right. That’s why I could get married a million times, but I can’t stay.
ERHARD
Caring is very attractive. The only problem is it’s no fun to do it with a robot. And you’re a fuck-
ing robot. You know, like a doll. Like a caring doll. You push on the button that says “I care.” It’s
a lot of fun for a little while. But after a while it’s got to have some substance. You took a very 
good thing and turned it into a mechanism.
(referring to Mike)
You see, he at least took something bad and turned it into a mechanism.
(laughter)r
He had a little better luck than you did. You took something really good and turned it into a 
mechanism. So you know, his straightness, his authenticity leaks out around his act. But you 
took caring and being, like really being there, and turned it into an act, and it obscures your
authentic caring and authentic feeling.
