KIPP
Do you understand what she’s saying? She says your life is designed by your case, by your rack-
et. You get a life inside your case. And that’s your life. You don’t do things that are inconsistent
with your racket.
CLAUDIA
Right, and the other thing... The reason that I don’t want anybody to look at me is because, um,
can I say “I’m afraid”? I’m afraid of being unattractive. And so I’m always unattractive from the
context of being attractive or unattractive...
KIPP
Is that how you say it to yourself, is that “you’re unattractive,” or what?
CLAUDIA
No. I don’t want anyone to look at me because they’re going to notice or judge and decide 
whether they fi nd me attractive or not.
KIPP
Well, what do you think? Are you attractive?
CLAUDIA
Well, seeing that life is empty and meaningless...
(laughter)r
KIPP
Good. See all the service those people paid to let her speak like this?
CLAUDIA
So, I attract people when I attract people and I don’t when I don’t.
KIPP
Yeah.
(applause)
CLAUDIA
And the other thing that it has cost me from participating in, and what I’ve been noticing here is...
WES
Notice how the signifi cance of all that has disappeared: this whole thing about attraction. Most 
relationships... how signifi cant can a relationship really be when most relationships are like two
slot machines face-to-face waiting for a simultaneous jackpot?
