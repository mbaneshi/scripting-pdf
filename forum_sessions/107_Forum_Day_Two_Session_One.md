Forum Day Two: Session One

(referring to Sienna)
What she said, I felt I could identify with and so I felt that I had nothing to contribute. But for
me to really get something out of being here, I really need to say it out loud. I seem to have the
answer for myself and everyone, and I’m so busy looking good that I’m not getting my..., that
having all the answers has killed off  the possibility in my life.
WES
Like maybe you’ve killed your life.
PHOEBE
Yeah, that I’m so smart and that I’ve got it so fi gured out, that I have the answer and no possi-
bility. And I noticed when we did our homework, last night and this morning, that all that kept
coming up was lots of answers and no new stuff , which is what I think I got out of yesterday,
the possibilities of what my life could be about. That’s what I don’t have is possibility in my life.
WES
Got it. Great. Thanks.
(another participant stands)
ROSS
I’ve been waiting for the right time to get up here and say something profound and so this is the
right time, but it isn’t anything profound.
WES
The wrong time is when it is profound, so you don’t have to worry about it. How many are wait-
ing for something signifi cant, profound, before you’re going to get up to share?
(many raising their hands)
We don’t want your crummy shares! If you really listen you’ll fi nd that the most powerful shares
are some of the simplest and dealing with the most ordinary aspects of our life. From the power
and insight of The Forum to shed light on the ordinary aspects of our life, you’ll fi nd some of
the most powerful things you’ve listened to. Thanks for acknowledging that.
ROSS
What happened for me yesterday and last night and I’m convinced, also while I was sleeping,
was just the continuous looking again at all the beliefs, a lot of the things that I’ve been work-
ing on in this area, and opening up diff erent possibilities for it, and starting really, one of the
reasons why I came to The Forum was that I wanted to take a look at what the barriers were for
my success. I’ve been successful in the past, I’ve been able to create the things that I’ve wanted,
and then they slipped away, for whatever reason, and I really want to take a look at what those
barriers were and what’s been happening. All yesterday and last night, and this morning is, let’s
take a look at the distinctions. They’re really starting to separate. I fi nd that I spend a lot of time
and energy in the story, and very little time dealing with what’s happening.
as well as the Interval “Dasein: Meaning and Mineness” at the end
of Session Two, Day One). A dog can be a dog only for a human
being; only for a human can a sunset be beautiful. But also among
the entities freed by Dasein to be in the world are other human
beings—entities which are “like the very Dasein which frees them,
in that they are there too, and there with it” (BT 154).
T
These terms—with and too—are to be understood existential-
ly. That is, Being-there-too does not mean merely that the Others
are present-at-hand in the world, available to be encountered.
Heidegger is not describing a situation in which beings are located
alongside each other in world space; rather he is distinguishing
integral elements of the beings themselves. Withness is a part of
Dasein’s Being—my own Dasein, and the Dasein of Others. The
“too,” says Heidegger, means a “sameness of Being” (BT 154).
T
Heidegger makes precise use of hyphenation in languaging
the ontological world-structure he is proposing. Early on in Being
and Time, he specifies that Things—substances, equipment,
objects of nature—are within the world, a location-relationship
that he indicates by the absence of hyphenation (BT 91). Here, he
T
posits a further specification:
“
Thus Dasein’s world frees entities which are
not only quite distinct from equipment and
Things, but which also—in accordance with
their kind of being as Dasein themselves—are
‘in’ the world in which they are at the same
time encountered within-the-world, and are
‘in’ it by way of Being-in-the-world. . . . So if
one would want to identify the world in gen-
eral with entities within-the-world, one would
have to say that Dasein too is ‘world.’ (BT 154)
T
So because Dasein—mine and the Others’—are in-the-world exis-
tentially, we can be encountered “in” the world environmentally.
Once again, we call attention to the deeply reflexive nature
of Heidegger’s ontological distinctions. His languaging repeatedly
turns thinking back upon itself, since his goal is to have us bend
back to see ourselves from a new perspective.

SPEAKING BEING
WES
Yeah.
ROSS
And in the short time that I’ve been doing this, I’ve already noticed some openness come into
the picture.
WES
Yeah, what if you lived your life totally in a story? Just consider that as a possibility. Now I
know you can always fi nd exceptions, but you know the exception only shows the rule. So don’t
look at the exceptions. Stand in the possibility that your whole life is a story. And as you get
the distinction “story versus what happened,” you might notice that life is passing by, and that
you’re in a story about life. You’re not in life.
ROSS
There were lots of things that I took a look at last night and the major thing that I’d like to share
with you is integrity... is probably one of my major inauthenticities, at least there’s a possibility
for that. And I’m real quick to pick it up in somebody else. Actually as a result of yesterday I’ve
been able to look at some of the possibilities where I am not in integrity. I did an exercise with
my daytimer, and I realized that all the things that are really important to me just didn’t get
done. And so there’s one major commitment not kept, which I really felt to be important to me
having accomplished.
WES
Great. Thank you.
MARSHA
Last night when I went home, I guess things were starting to get uncovered because I was so
angry. My normal thing is to be the cheerleader and get up in the morning and get things done
and extend myself so far wide that there’s nothing left for me. It is starting to wear on me physi-
cally, and what I got last night was that I am so angry, so angry: at me. It came across at fi rst last
night, being so angry at Werner. I did the training 15 years ago, but if I saw Werner out in the
parking lot last night I would have run him over. I was so angry. I chewed off  my sister-in-law’s
head last night. It has never been expressed like this before, because it has been so important
to me to express, to get across, “you don’t like me and I’m going to make you like me,” and that
has taken a tremendous amount of energy, and what is underneath that is just a lot of anger.
WES
And anything underneath that?
MARSHA
I don’t know yet. I’m just really into the anger now.
In Heidegger’s account of Being-with, we find “world” per-
vaded by relatedness. The presence of Others is embedded in all
of our everyday activities. When we are at work on a project, the
Others for whom the project is being performed are encountered
in the work. If we walk along the edge of a field, the field “shows
itself as belonging to such and such a person.” If I am at leisure,
the book I am reading “was bought at So-and-so’s shop and given
by such-and-such a person, and so forth” (BT 154).
T
Heidegger is not making the obvious point that the book
belongs to someone, but is emphasizing the degree to which the
presence of my relatedness to Others imbues my existence. Others
whom I encounter in these objects and activities are a part of my
world and in the same way I am a part of theirs.
“
By reason of this with-like Being-in-the-world,
the world is always the one that I share with
Others. The world of Dasein is a with-world.
Being-in is Being-with Others. Their Being-
in-themselves within-the-world is Dasein-with.
(BT 155)
clearing for me. Others make it possible for me to Be, a situation
that persists even when no Other is present.
“
Even Dasein’s Being-alone is Being-with in the
world. The Other can be missing only in and for
a Being-with. Being-alone is a deficient mode of
Being-with; its very possibility is the proof of
this. (BT 156–157)
T
Thus Heidegger has distinguished in withness an extraordi-
nary existential possibility for human relatedness, a possibility
which we see as an essential element of The Forum transforma-
tion. Here he specifies another aspect of this connection:
“
Being-with is such that the disclosedness of
the Dasein-with of Others belongs to it; this
means that because Dasein’s Being is Being-
with, its understanding of Being already
