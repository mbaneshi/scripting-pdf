Forum Day Four: Session Three 473
NICK
What I wanted to ask, you know, I’m standing at the threshold of not what I used to call
possibility, but of nothing—like, really nothing.
ERHARD
There is no possibility for an authentic conversation for possibility until you are standing on
nothing. And Nick’s gotten us to the right place because that’s where we are going. We need to
demonstrate something. You have to watch that The Forum gives you a platform to stand on,
and then The Forum is designed to pull the platform out from under you. So remember that
whenever you get set, we’re going to pull the platform out from underneath you. “Oh now I got
that! I got my racket!” Now we’re not interested in rackets. That’s horseshit. What is this rackets
crap? Don’t get stuck back yesterday. Be with today. It’s a new ball game.

The question is: What is the source of action? Why do I act the way I act? I’m defi ning action
broadly. Normally we think of action as just some kind of moving. Consider that your feelings
are a kind of action, a kind of action in the world, and that your thoughts are a kind of action in
the world. And so we’re asking in a broad sense, what is the source of action? Why do you and I act
the way we act? Now there’s a standard answer, isn’t there? There’s an everybody-knows answer;
there’s an everybody-knows answer, isn’t there? If I ask you “Why did you do that?” There’s an
everybody-knows answer, and the answer that everybody knows is “I did it because I fi gured out
that it was the right thing to do,” or “I did it because I have this thing in me that makes me act
automatically, or I did it out of my experience, or my intelligence, or I did it out of my training.”
It’s like that. Why are some people more eff ective in their actions than others? Tell me why. Why
are some people more eff ective in their actions than others? Well some people have more talent
than others, right? So we’ve got this notion that there’s something inside of us whence springs
action. We look at someone and say that person has more talent than me and so they act more
eff ectively than I do. Or he has more experience. Or she has more training than I have. Or he is
more intelligent than I am and so he fi gures it out better than I can. We have an idea it’s talent,
experience, training. I want to get you oriented because it’s not a question anybody asks. Nobody
ever asks you what is the source of action? They ask why did you do that and you come up with
that stupid reason, which doesn’t have any access to the source of action. But if you stop to ask the
question... so I want you dwelling in the question, and I want you dwelling in the answer you dwell
in. Let’s get this “dwelling” straightened out. You don’t think that the source of action is something
inside you. You are that the source of action is something inside you. You don’t need to think it.
Everybody get that? It’s not merely something you think. Without thinking you and I are that the
source of action is something inside of people: either a quality you have, or an experience you have,
or knowledge you have, or something of the sort. And I want you to see that you and I go through
life and deal with life and deal with ourselves dwelling in that the source of action is something
inside of ourselves. Anybody who can’t see that? Get your hand up.
SHERYL
I don’t see it.
takes an action that I find inconsistent with her generally generous
behavior, I may say to her, “You are being stingy.” In the first case,
my statement suggests a defect in the being she is; in the second
case, I am pointing out an unpleasant way she is presently be-ing
that being. The verbal diff erence is slight, but the diff erence in
implication is significant.
By the time of Plato and Aristotle, says Heidegger, on and onta
had become conceptual—that is, they had become representations
of already-thought ideas. They appear for us today as the roots
of the words ontic and ontological. But for the pre-Socratics, who
were for the first time raising questions about existence itself, the
distinction between the event of be-ing—that is, emerging into
unconcealment—and the entity which emerged and persisted, had
never been thought before.
As we have seen, physis is an ambiguous term with a complex of
meanings, including both the event of a being’s emergence into
unconcealment, as well as the being that has thereby emerged
into unconcealment. The early Greek thinkers experienced this
phenomenon in its entirety, says Heidegger. Their world was
grounded in what the scholar Charles Guignon has called an
“event ontology” (A Companion to Heidegger’s Introduction to
Metaphysics. 36)—that is, they experienced not only the beings
in the world, but their emerging and presencing as well.
They experienced the logos as gathering. But they
experienced it, says Heidegger, “without question” (IM 66).
In the thinking of Heraclitus the Being (pres-
encing) of being appeared as logos, as the
Laying that gathers. But this lightning-flash re-
mains forgotten. [. . .] In fact, the Greeks dwelt
in this essential determination of language.
But they never thought it—Heraclitus included.
[. . .] Nowhere do we find a trace of the Greeks
having thought the essence of language direct-
ly from the essence of Being. (EGT 76–77)

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Do you play tennis?
SHERYL
Sometimes.
ERHARD
Are there people who are better than you at tennis?
SHERYL
Yes.
ERHARD
How do you explain their being better?
SHERYL
They play more.
ERHARD
And by playing more what do you mean? It’s not just a matter of playing more, it’s that they
have something inside themselves...
SHERYL
They’ve developed the skill...
ERHARD
Yeah, they’ve developed the skill. They have the experience, but they also carry that around
inside themselves, don’t they?
SHERYL
Yes.
ERHARD
In other words, if they played every day but it didn’t change their insides, they wouldn’t be
better than you are, would they?
SHERYL
Yes, that’s true.
ERHARD
You and I are that the guy who can play tennis better than you or I might be able to do, can do
so because of something inside of him or her. You get the point?
In the terminology of Heidegger’s Being and Time, the pre-Socratic
understanding of their experience was pre-ontological (BT 32).
In Guignon’s words, they never thematized the insight of their
experience (A Companion to Heidegger’s Introduction to Metaphysics.
37). If they had, says Heidegger, the world would undoubtedly be
quite diff erent:
Language would be saying. Language would
be the gathering letting-lie-before of what is
present in its presencing. [. . .] Nothing less
than this: the Greeks would have thought the
essence of language directly from the essence
of Being. . . . (EGT 77)
“
But human thinking took a diff erent path, and “Greek philosophy
never returned to this ground of Being.”
Instead, the focus shift ed to “the foreground of that which comes
to presence . . .” (IM 66, emphasis added). With this shift , Western
thinking began its evolution toward the metaphysical model—what
Guignon calls a “substance ontology” (A Companion to Heidegger’s
