Forum Day One: Session One

ERHARD
Very, very little in life turns out the way it was promised. So I remember my mother told me if I
was a good boy everything would be great in life. I tried it for one day and it didn’t work. People
are told that when they graduate life will be wonderful, life will be easy, and it didn’t turn out
that way. When you get married it’ll be great but it doesn’t turn out that way. People say when
you get divorced it’ll be all right but it doesn’t turn out that way. Most things don’t live up to
their promises.
RUTH
And what about the promises of The Forum?
ERHARD
Based on surveys, most people who’ve done this work say it turned out better than they expect-
ed. For you that’ll be easy, because you have a pessimistic view about how things’ll turn out.
We’ve got your six hundred dollars. You’re not going to get it back. Given that conversation’s
over, it’ll turn out however it turns out. You know, I’ve never been wrong about that.
(To Ruth)
I could say a lot of things to reassure you, and that would be a mistake. Your pessimism is you.
(raising his voice, he turned to the group)
Listen up! If you haven’t noticed, The Forum has begun. See, you and I think that our mood,
our internal state, the way we are seeing things; we think that is a product of the circumstanc-
t
es. So I look at something and I like it, or I look at something and I don’t like it. I think if I
like it, it’s the fault of the thing I’m looking at, and if I don’t like it, I think it’s the fault of the
thing I’m looking at. That’s the kind of thing that generates in me: “like”; and that’s the kind
of thing that generates in me: “don’t like.” You and I think that our way of being is a product of
what’s over there. As you will see as we do The Forum together a lot of what is going on with
you and me is something we already always are. It’s something I am before anything happens.
I’m kind of a pessimist waiting for life to happen, or I’m an optimist waiting for life to happen.
About certain kinds of things I’m a pessimist before I even look at them, and then when I look
at them, it’s hard for me to recognize that the pessimism isn’t generated out of the thing I’m
looking at, but it’s something I brought with me. Kind of like I was already always pessimistic
and then this thing came along. So it’s good that you’re pessimistic, and if you’re not pessimis-
tic, that’s good too.
(to Ruth)
If you find yourself being that way, don’t try to change it. What’s good is whatever you are,
because that’s what you want to bring into The Forum. If you deal with that pessimism
which you are in a certain way, you’ll have a choice about being pessimistic when it is ap-
propriate. Pessimism is not a bad idea, and if you didn’t have pessimism I would give it to
you, because one of the things you’re going to find in here is that we ask you not to believe
anything that’s said in here. We’ll talk more about that later. At any rate, the point that
project. There is a sense in which we don’t know what we are
talking about, and the emphasis in that sentence should be placed
on the word “know,” as implying a secure conceptual grasp.
Talking about Being is challenging and sometimes feels, to use
the vernacular, weird. Being is both pervasive and evanescent. It
is elusive, vanishing even as it appears.
In his writing about Being (and all of his writing is about
Being), Heidegger celebrates the ambiguity surrounding the topic.
This is “something which every thinker has to see afresh each
time, else he is not a thinker: that everything that lies before us is
ambiguous” (WCT 201). However, this does not mean fuzziness at
T
the expense of rigor:
NOTE:  Erhard believes that Heidegger’s use of the word
“thought” leaves people misled about what Heidegger
means in the following way: Perhaps the word “thought” is
valid for what is written down for people to consider, but it
did not come from “thinking”—by which most people will
understand “figuring it out”—it came from something like
“looking,” or “just being with,” and is pointed to by the word
“wonder” (Erhard, interview with the authors).
This multiplicity of possible interpretations
does not discredit the strictness of the thought
content. For all true thought remains open
to more than one interpretation—and this by
reason of its nature. Nor is this multiplicity of
possible interpretations merely the residue
of a still unachieved formal-logical univocity
which we properly ought to strive for but did
not attain. Rather, multiplicity of meanings is
the element in which all thought must move in
order to be strict thought. (WCT 71)

SPEAKING BEING
Nevertheless, despite its challenges, we assert that Being is
also the most important thing that one could talk about, since
talk that evokes Being has the ability to transform talk about
everything else.
A fundamental difference in this arena is the distinction
between ontological and
l
ontic inquiry. Ontological inquiry is
concerned primarily with Being. Therefore all of Heidegger’s
writing, and all of the dialogue of The Forum, is ontological in
nature. Ontic inquiry is concerned with beings, and with facts
about them. Therefore all of our everyday conversations—
everything from political discourse to casual social chat—may be
seen as ontic.
This is not to dismiss ontic inquiry as unimportant, or to
equate a discussion of religion or physics with coffeeshop banter.
We are not claiming that ontological inquiry is better, but that
it is essentially different. And in the experience of the authors,
it is profoundly interesting because of its transformational
possibilities. In this book, we will illuminate the nature of
ontological inquiry.
A prefatory note: people who write about Heidegger’s
work differ as to whether the term Being should be capitalized.
This is, of course, a choice for translators and not one that
confronted Heidegger, since in German all nouns are capitalized.
It is a problematic choice because capitalization tends to reify
or even deify, suggesting to some scholars that Being is “an
eternal metaphysical foundation or eternal principle,” while
for Heidegger it was “the event in which an entity reveals or
t
shows itself” (Michael E. Zimmerman, Heidegger’s Confrontation
with Modernity: Technology, Politics, Art xxii). Others feel that
t
capitalization is important so that what it means to exist (Being)
is not confused with the entities that exist (beings) (Richard Polt
Heidegger: An Introduction 3).
In print, Erhard himself did not capitalize the term: a 1985
Forum brochure states that the purpose of The Forum is to
provide participants with “direct access to the domain of being
itself.” In his more recent work, such as documents outlining
I want to make now is that whatever it is that you’re feeling, or whatever it is that you’re
thinking, or whatever your mental state is, or whatever your perception is, the way you are
viewing things—that’s exactly the way it ought to be. I’m going to probably have to say that
to you ten times, because you won’t remember that.
(to the group)
Another way you already always are is stupid about yourself. If that sounded a little bit like an
insult, you got it right. You may not be able to see that about yourself, but you’ll be able to see it
about others. As I said: not you, but other people.
(laughter)
There are ways of being with yourself that are disempowering and disenabling. You lose power
and you lose ability. Whatever way you fi nd yourself now, and whatever ways you fi nd yourself
variously throughout The Forum or in the evenings, or on the breaks: that’s the way you’re sup-
posed to be—whatever way that is. One way to disempower or disenable yourself is to question
whether you are being the right way... You’ll get a lot more out of The Forum a lot faster if you
let yourself be the way you are.
(pausing)
There’s a lot of this you’re not going to get. Some of it won’t make any sense. You’re not going
to get the whole Forum. The questions we’re asking in here are too powerful to get it all. The
Forum leaders are still getting it. So am I. But there are parts when you need to get it. In those
parts, put up your hand if you don’t. There will be a lot of repetition in here, too. For the fourth
time: you should be the way you are! However you feel, that’s the way it ought to be. The way
I know that is, that’s the way it is... The only right way to do The Forum is to be the way you’re
being. If you say you shouldn’t be pessimistic, you’re getting in your way.
A participant complained that she was distracted by and resentful about the physical set-up for this
Forum—the cameras, the observers, etc.
ERHARD
What you want to get out of that is that life is upsetting because it isn’t the way you expected it
to be. The Forum will be that way also. What you want to get out of that is that you’re already
upset. You’re already always upset at any change, at anything that violates your expectations.
You think you’re not upset until something violates your expectations. I said this strange thing:
you are already always upset. You live upset. I know you don’t believe that and I’m not asking
you to. You’re an upset waiting to happen. You’ll see that more clearly as we proceed.
LYNETTE
I’m often upset.
ERHARD
You’re always upset, and sometimes you notice it.
ERHARD (continuing)
