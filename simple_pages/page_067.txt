Forum Day One: Session Two

ERHARD
Did you get that he doesn’t agree with that?
JAKE
We’re not exactly aligned.
ERHARD
I understand that. Jake, you’re not exactly aligned from exactly the same place.
(addressing the two men)
You’re both nutty about your word. He’s coming from the same thing. If you thought it was gold
t
and you stamped gold on it, then it’s really gold. You hear how stupid that sounds?
JAKE
Yeah.
ERHARD
That’s what you said.
JAKE
I didn’t say that.
ERHARD (indicating Paul)
That’s what he said. Pretty stupid what he said, isn’t it? If you thought it was gold and you 
t
stamped gold on it, then it’s really gold. That’s what really counts, what you intended. Right?
JAKE
It doesn’t make it authentic, but it doesn’t make me dishonest. It doesn’t make me a liar either.
ERHARD  (to the group) 
I’m taking all this time with this bullshit because I want to accomplish something. No mat-
ter what I bring up, somebody will have a thing about it. Somebody will be nutty about it. No 
matter what they’re saying, it’s obvious these two guys are intelligent. But they’ve got their foot
nailed to the fl oor, so it’s like talking to stupid people. Being stuck makes you stupid. There’s no 
power available where you’ve got your foot nailed to the fl oor. All this conversation regarding
intention, in response to my simple statement about authenticity, indicates that there’s some 
nuttiness there. The point is, at some point, you will be that person.
(to Jake)
And to settle this conversation: I ask you to stand in—that a person who presents himself one 
way, and in fact acts another way, for any reason, is inauthentic. That’s not true. It’s a “take the
case that” I’m asking you to stand in. Is that clear?
“ 
There’s no power available where you’ve got
your foot nailed to the floor.
