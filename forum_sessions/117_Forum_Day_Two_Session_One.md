Forum Day Two: Session One

MIKE
Yes, I know how to walk.
ERHARD
Okay, tell me.
MIKE
No, I don’t know how to walk.
ERHARD
Okay good.
(to the group)
You’ve all got a lot of stupid notions. You’re a bunch of thoughtless people. You’ve given very
little thought to anything of signifi cance. You have a lot of thoughts, but you don’t give thought.
So in here, you and I are going to give thought. Like most of the other people on the plan-
et, Mike never stopped to look at whether he knew how to walk: wasn’t too important to his
walking, so why bother? But in here, some of the things you take for granted, we won’t take
those things for granted. See, it’s common sense that if a person walks they know how to. But
Mike and I just reduced the idea of knowing how to walk to an absurdity. Maybe knowing how
is not the pathway. You can’t produce art by the numbers. So getting back to this standing in a
possibility: you think it, not believe it or agree with it. You think it. You think: “people are ac-
complished in-order-to.” So what they get is avoiding the “order-to.” But avoiding the “order-to”
is the same as being attached to the “order-to.” Stand in there and take a look at life from there
and think that, generate it as a possibility. Speak to yourself or others. Clear?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
Thank you. That was a very useful conversation.
MIKE
Thank you.
(applause)
ERHARD (returning to Marsha)
So Marsha, you were saying?
MARSHA
I’m angry at everyone in the world, because what I know about each person in the world is that
they don’t like me. I’m angry at them.
Giving and Reflexion
In his use here of the word “gives,” Erhard is employing a term
that was central in Heidegger’s eff orts to say the relationship of
language to Being.
For anyone who has participated in the work of Werner Er-
hard, and has experienced the way that a particular combination
of words can make available a new perspective on the world, a
primary delight in reading Heidegger is surrendering to his precise
and profoundly reflexive languaging. Its frequent circularity is
consistent with its purpose, which is not to take us anywhere new,
but to bring us “back to where we already are,” which, he warns, is
“infinitely harder.” His task is to “think Being without beings”—that
is, to bring Being to language as distinct from beings, a distinction
that has been lost to our metaphysical tradition. He wants to say
Being; his task is therefore “unceasingly to overcome the obstacles
that tend to render such saying inadequate” (OTB 24).
The Being of Language
One of these obstacles he confronts in undertaking this task is
found in the nature of language itself. Language was increasingly
the focus in Heidegger’s later writing, and his most well-known
statement is his assertion that “Language is the House of Being”
(“LH” in BW 217). But what about the Being of language itself?
W
Here Heidegger articulates the conundrum:
“
We speak of language, but constantly seem
to be speaking merely about language, while
in fact we are already letting language, from
within language, speak to us, in language, of
itself, saying its nature. (“NL” in OWL 85)
Heidegger’s characteristic response to this aporic puzzle is to
problematize it further, beginning with a line from the German
poet Stefan George, which reasserts his own view of language:
“Where word breaks off  no thing may be.” He teases us into the
paradox created by this statement: if without language things can-
not be, then things are only when the word already is. But is a word
a thing? On the one hand, it seems so: “if the word is to endow the
thing with being, it too must be before any thing is—thus it must

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
So, “I am ‘they don’t like me’ waiting to happen.” The already always listening I am is “you
don’t like me, so what was that you were going to say?”
MARSHA
I am already always “you don’t like me.” I’m angry at that.
ERHARD (to the group)
Yeah. And something happened when Marsha was a little girl. And when somebody didn’t like
her, getting angry worked for that little girl. Now the little girl is running the mature woman
with a lot of relational skills being put to use by a little girl who gets angry because people don’t
like her. There’s a little girl mashed in with a mature and competent woman. And the mashing
is that the little girl is in charge, calling the shots. And the mature competent woman keeps her
in charge by being afraid she might be angry, and not wanting to be. And see, the people who
can see Marsha now want to make her feel better. I don’t want to make her feel better. I want
her just like she is, because what she is doing is growing up. She’s getting to the source of what
she’s afraid she might be. When she’s completed that, she’ll have a freedom to be that she didn’t
have before this conversation. She won’t know better how not to be angry. There’ll be a freedom
that wasn’t there before. She’ll be related to people eff ectively in order to be related to people
eff ectively. That’s fulfi lling. The thing in itself. Anything else?
MARSHA
I suppressed anger starting in the fi fth grade.
ERHARD
What happened?
(to the group)
Listen through the distinctions we developed yesterday. “People don’t like me” never happens.
It’s a story about what happens. “People don’t like me” can’t happen. If you can’t see that, stand
up?
A participant stood up and takes a microphone.
ERHARD
Lisa, I said, “people don’t like me” never happens.
LISA (smiling)
I get it now.
ERHARD
It never happens, it’s always a story isn’t it? It’s a story about what happened. Larry said you’re
a jerk. He might even have said, “I don’t like you.” That’s what happened, and you told the story
“people don’t like me.” “People don’t like me” can’t happen, can it?
inescapably be itself a thing” (“NL” in OWL 86). But can a thing
then give being to another thing? If things cannot be without the
prior existence of words, the inevitable conclusion is that “word
and thing are diff erent, even disparate” (“NL” in OWL 86). But what
could be the nature of that diff erence?
Words can be said, but can the word for a word ever be said? A
dictionary is filled with terms, but no words, since “a dictionary can
neither grasp nor keep the word by which the terms become words
and speak as words.” When we try to think this, Heidegger proposes,
we seem to arrive at the conclusion that “saying has no being.” But
then another question presents itself: we say a thing is when a word
is available. But what about the “is” itself? “The ‘is’ cannot be found
anywhere as a thing attached to a thing.” Indeed, “It belongs no more
among the things that are than does the word” (“NL” in OWL 87).
At this point in our thinking, we may throw in the towel; or,
says Heidegger, if we will follow him for one more step, we may be
struck by something we had not noticed. While we have reached no
answers in our inquiry—it has raised neither the word nor the “is”
nor the relation between the two to the status of thinghood—it has
pointed us toward something “thought-provoking and memorable.”
It has suggested the possibility of “what is there and yet ‘is’ not.”
“
The word, too, belongs to what is there—per-
haps not merely “too” but first of all, and even
in such a way such that the word, the nature
of the word, conceals within itself that which
gives [B]eing. If our thinking does justice to
the matter, then we may never say of the word
that it is, but rather that it gives—not in the
sense that words are given by an “it,” but that
the word itself gives. (“NL” in OWL 87-88)
Out of the unspoken background, the word gives a context of
meaning for human action.
Thus we have dug down to the essential simplicity: es gibt (it
t
gives). Heidegger is languaging the Being/being relationship that
is also the heart of his important term, appropriation. As we will
show later in this book, the nature of appropriation is absolutely
central to the ultimate rhetorical move of The Forum.
