Forum Day Four: Session One

JOYCE
Not liking yourself?
ERHARD
Yeah. Obvious, huh? You can’t have liking yourself without not liking yourself. Get rid of both
of them. It’s a bullshit conversation. There’s nothing in there. It’s pure drama.
JOYCE
It’s arguing with yourself.
ERHARD
It’s like arguing if you’re blue or green. Are you blue or green?
JOYCE
I’m neither.
ERHARD
Absolutely. It’s like, are you likable or unlikable? It’s like asking you if you’re blue or green.
It’s the same kind of question. Are you blue or green? It’s nonsense. It’s garbage, and if you
ask garbage questions you get garbage answers. Every time someone likes theirself, what gets
reinforced?
JOYCE
I don’t know.
ERHARD
Not liking theirself. Don’t you see that you can’t have a lot of liking yourself and just a little
bit of not liking yourself? They got to be exactly even, because you can’t build liking yourself
except in contrast to not liking yourself.
JOYCE
You’re saying to throw both of them away.
ERHARD
Yeah. This is a garbage question liking yourself/not liking yourself. Cut that out. Hold some-
body’s hand; look up at the sky; go make something happen: But don’t waste your time with the
question of liking yourself or not liking yourself. That’s your racket.
JOYCE  (weeping)
One of my rackets...

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Right: and a signifi cant racket for you. What you have to get to is that it’s empty and meaning-
less. Underneath your racket is all empty and meaningless. If I take away liking yourself and
not liking yourself, what are you left with? Nothing. There’s where we want to leave you: with
nothing. Is that clearer?
JOYCE
Yeah, but I don’t want to be left with nothing.
ERHARD
I know, because there’s a payoff  in not liking yourself. You’re getting something out of it. You’re
a racketeer. You’re in it for the payoff .
JOYCE
Yes, I am.
ERHARD
Yeah. You like the payoff , be my guest.
JOYCE
No I don’t like it.
ERHARD
Then cut it out. And if you can’t cut it out, where you need to get to is that underneath the
racket is empty and meaningless. You have to see that your racket’s a joke. You’re not going to
get rid of your racket, ever. You get rid of one, you’ll fi nd another one under that. It’s endless.
It’s rackets all the way down, I told you. It’s like peeling an onion. You take off  one racket, you
get another racket. You take off  another racket, you get another racket. You know what’s at the
center of an onion? Nothing. When you pull the last layer off , what’s left? Nothing. Sorry for the
cheap metaphor. Life is empty and meaningless and it doesn’t mean anything that life is empty
and meaningless. Did you get it? I didn’t say “did you feel good?” I said “did you get it?”
JOYCE
Life is empty and meaningless that life is empty and meaningless means nothing.
ERHARD
No. It’s life is empty and meaningless and that doesn’t mean anything. Don’t give any meaning
to that. See, you’re trying to make that mean something. Like, “Well, then I shouldn’t have to
bother!” No. It doesn’t mean anything; you can’t make meaning out of it, otherwise you destroy
it. And as soon as you do make it mean something you take the truth power out of it; you take
the truth value out of it. Then it becomes some stupid platitude that you bother people with.
“Don’t you know that life is empty and meaningless?” People don’t want to hear that shit.
