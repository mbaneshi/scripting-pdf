SPEAKING BEING
people have graduated from The Forum, either the four-day Forum of Erhard’s time
through 1991, or the current iteration of the course, the three-day Landmark
Forum (www.landmarkworldwide.com).1
Erhard’s influence on the culture has made itself felt in another way as well.
During the 1970s, when it sometimes seemed that every fifth person in San Francis-
co was an est graduate, you could generally detect that element of the population
t
by their use of the program’s language, which in casual use began to be heard as
jargon. Erhard’s use of this terminology, however, was highly purposive, and many
of those words and phrases made their way into the public sphere, some to last-
ing effect. An example has been the shift in the popular understanding of the term
sharing. Before est, people shared a cookie or a bench in the park; what was shared
was divided, and in the process one’s own share was inevitably diminished. But
in the est Training,
g participants shared their experience, and through sharing, that
experience was augmented. To share, in the world of est, was to communicate in
such a way that one’s self and not merely one’s story was made available, leaving the
f
other touched rather than merely informed. This meaning of the word, we assert, is
now common in our culture. Likewise, the term coaching, borrowed by Erhard from
the sports arena in the early eighties to identify the style of his pedagogy, has since
become ubiquitous in the field of management, human resources, and executive
coaching. And the ubiquitous Mastercard catchphrase, “Master the possibilities,”
was born in the mind of an est graduate for whom the term
t
possibility had acquired
a new level of meaning; however, through overuse in the media, this new level of
meaning has diminished.
The move to discontinue the Training in 1985 and replace it with The Forum
arose from Erhard’s perception of a shift in the culture’s way of responding to the
Training; he wanted to design a course that was responsive to that shift. At this
point, while Erhard’s success during those years had been greeted by considerable
media curiosity, scholarly interest was moderate. Several studies of the est Training
t
attempted to measure its effects using a psychological model; while he considered
such efforts valuable, Erhard has asserted that this approach is inappropriate for
analysis of his work. His work, he says, is not psychological but ontological: his
concern is the being of human beings (“Heart of the Matter” 1984). He has also
consistently emphasized that the focus of his work is the development of the lan-
guage in which it is articulated. Yet no significant scholarly work dealing either with
Erhard’s language use, or with the nature of an ontological methodology, has been
published, even in the academic fields most likely to be deeply concerned with
such matters—rhetoric and writing studies, business management, philosophy, and
communication studies. This book aims to begin to correct that omission.
Before proceeding, we offer this statement of authorial stance: The authors
have engaged extensively, both as participants and as scholars, in numerous pro-
grams designed by Werner Erhard. The senior author took the est Training for the
t
first time in 1973, and we have each participated a number of times in The Forum,
both during Erhard’s tenure in the organization and following his departure. Our
doctoral dissertations (University of Southern California, 1990; University of Arizona,
2008) consisted of rhetorical and philosophical analyses of The Forum. Based upon
this considerable study and experience, our assessment of Erhard’s work is un-
equivocal: we have found this work to be pedagogically effective and intellectually
significant in all of its historical iterations. Our intention in this book is to stimulate
its serious consideration by the academic community, as well as by others in the
culture at large.
It is also important to note that our approach as participant observers has
its limits. To carry out the design of the book, we have precluded a number of
approaches that readers may wish to see addressed, and we beg those readers to
indulge us. Before any significant and critical treatments could be viable, or even
possible, from a number of disciplines—including philosophy, communication stud-
ies, rhetorical criticism, and so on—the phenomenon must be first made available.
We present this book as a way into the phenomenon in question, and consequently,
we invite members from a range of academic disciplines to enter the conversation
we are seeking to initiate.
Evolution
This is an historical document. It presents an account of one moment—albeit a sig-
nificant one—in an ongoing project for the development of human being. The first
iteration of this project, the est Training, was designed to communicate to people
t
living in the cultural environment of the 1970s. As Erhard saw it, considerable logis-
tical rigor was required for the course to achieve its purpose, and thus the format
included demands for which est soon became notorious, including lengthy sessions
t
1 Landmark describes The Landmark Forum as a personal and professional development program,
based on the discipline of applied ontology and phenomenology. Erhard created the work in the
early 1970s and continued its development until in 1991 Landmark took over its ongoing devel-
opment as expressed in The Landmark Forum and other Landmark programs. As of the writing of
this book, the material and structure of The Forum have continued to be developed during three
decades since the 1989 Forum presented in this book. The Landmark Forum of today (circa 2019)
is less time (three days and an evening and each day ends by 10:00 pm), it incorporates the use of
PowerPoint displays and videos that enhance the participants’ experience of and access to what is
being presented, and there is no use of profanity on the part of the program leaders.

with limited bathroom breaks, a highly confrontational interaction style—with
the use of expletives—and the surrender of all wristwatches at the door. These
demands were modified when The Forum replaced the Training; and in subsequent
years, as the communication paradigm of the culture has continued to shift, the
delivery of The Forum has altered accordingly.
On the one hand, of course, The Forum conversation inevitably challenges
participants’ familiar way of seeing things. Ontological inquiry—pedagogy such as
The Forum, that aims to get beyond mere conceptual knowledge—is of necessity
rigorous and sometimes uncomfortable. In Martin Heidegger’s words, authentic in-
quiry into Being always “has the character of doing violence, whether to the claims
of the everyday interpretation, or to its complacency and tranquillized obviousness”
(BT 359). But while the conversation in the current Landmark Forum remains rigor-
T
ous, participants will find a presentation that can for the most part be described as
gentler, and more user-friendly, than the one presented in this book.
A further aspect of this difference, of course, has to do with Werner Erhard’s
personal style. In his delivery of both the Training and The Forum, Erhard’s com-
munication was edgily playful and relentlessly purposive. He called his approach
ruthless compassion; and it included a profound sense of humor and Socratic
irony implicit in the human condition. To communicate the humor as well as the
compassion, he often provoked and insulted participants, using language gener-
ally considered inappropriate for such a setting (in a parody of one of his favorite
epithets, graduates of the Training were sometimes referred to as “estholes”). Yet, as
this book shows, those participants who initially resisted these intrusions inevitably
got the message. Erhard has related this confrontive aspect of his communication
to his 1971 experience of transformation: “On the bridge,” he said, “all of a sudden I
could be 100% responsible for everything in my life, and at the same time none of it
had any significance. At that point you are free and fearless” (Erhard, interview with
authors). Erhard’s communication style, and his humor, remain on full display in this
book; the authors see them as important and entertaining aspects of the historical
account we are presenting here.
Erhard Encounters Heidegger
Despite the shift we have cited here in The Forum’s style and tone, a central thesis
of this book is that from the first offering of the est Training in 1971, through its
t
replacement by the Forum in 1985 and its current iteration as the Landmark Forum,
the process at the heart of this pedagogy has retained its transformational
dynamic. This dynamic, as we will show, arises in the unspoken ontological realm
of The Forum conversation as it proceeds, and has been the essential element of the
course through all of its terminological variations.
During the transition to The Forum, Erhard excised many of the est Training’s
t
more meditative exercises and incorporated into the course a new vocabulary and
redesigned procedures, with the stated intention that participants would have an
enhanced experience of creating a new realm of possibility for themselves and their
y
lives. At about this time, through colleagues, he was introduced to the work of the
twentieth-century German philosopher Martin Heidegger. Erhard was taken with the
way Heidegger’s thinking reverberated with his own, and he consulted with several
Heideggerian scholars on the subject. Two of them—Hubert Dreyfus of University of
California, Berkeley and Michael E. Zimmerman of Tulane—provided formal assess-
ments of the est Training’s effectiveness, and noted its consistencies with elements
t
of Heidegger’s thought. When Erhard’s revised technology emerged in The Forum
and other redesigned courses, significant Heideggerian terminology was included
in its rhetorical mix, and Erhard occasionally read passages from Heidegger in his
presentations.
Most significantly, Erhard saw that Heidegger’s ideas and his own were commu-
nicating from the same unspoken realm, and that the specifications of the two vo-
cabularies could be merged to communicate that realm more powerfully: “I learned
from Heidegger,” said Erhard, “nuances of what I had been saying that clarified and
made more potent what was there” (Erhard, interview with authors).
What was there was Erhard’s technology of language for the communication of
being, and its ability, in both the Training and The Forum, to consistently and pow-
erfully evoke an experience that participants found transformative. The evocation
of that experience has remained The Forum’s essential element; Erhard’s encounter
with Heidegger enriched the vocabulary in which he could see into it more pro-
foundly and communicate it more effectively.
Technology
The form of this study will be comparative analysis: we will demonstrate that the
work of Werner Erhard is aligned in significant ways with the philosophy of Martin
Heidegger, and that a comparison of their work illuminates the thinking of both
men. We will show that The Forum’s dialogic form introduces a performative dimen-
sion of Heidegger’s ontological vocabulary in a way that Heidegger himself, working
within a restrictive academic and political culture, was unable to do. We propose
that The Forum conversation is ontological rhetoric: purposive speaking that com-
municates and makes present a context of meaning that, if left unexamined, shapes
4
SPEAKING BEING
thesis is that the work of Werner Erhard makes available the ontological domain of
language, so that the decentering of subjectivity and the reinvention of the self can
be experienced as possibilities rather than merely considered as theory.
We recognize that this pedagogical model is in many ways a radical one, given
the strength of the assumptions embedded in our tradition; but Heidegger says that
an experience with language in the ontological domain always requires “a leap.”
As our educational institutions struggle increasingly to generate an opening for the
human in the face of the advance of the technological, we argue that the situation is
critical, and that a leap of this kind is in order.
The Plan of the Book
The central text for this book, located in the left and right columns on either page,
is the combination of two sources: notes taken by the senior author while observing
a Forum in San Francisco led by Werner Erhard in December 1989, and a transcrip-
tion of the video of the same four-day event made available to the junior author on
location at Landmark Worldwide’s archives. While the transcript provides compre-
hensive and detailed conversations of the actual 1989 Forum, there are important
alterations that must be accounted for. First and foremost, all names have been
altered except for Werner Erhard, and actual names have been used only for those
participants who speak more than once or twice with Erhard or the other two indi-
viduals leading the course (“Kipp” and “Wes”). In addition, some conversations have
been edited out, or summarized, for the sake of space. For instance, all discussions
dealing with the Six-Day Course, discontinued in 1990, have been removed. Also
missing from the transcript is the Evening Session of the 1989 Forum: there was
no extant video recording of that event. However, that omission can be rectified
for interested readers if they were to attend an evening session of The Landmark
Forum, where participants will share their experience of the course for guests they
themselves have invited.
We call the text that accompanies the transcript either “sidebars” or “intervals.”
Sidebars occur in the central columns between the far left and right panes that
house the transcript of The Forum, and the intervals occur between sessions of the
course, and at the conclusion of each of the four days. In the sidebars and intervals
are relevant ideas from the thinking of Martin Heidegger. Sometimes the connection
between a sidebar and the transcript it accompanies may be apparent; sometimes
it may be intended obliquely, as a hint at the background. Intervals are more often
oblique in this way due to the focus on Heidegger’s thinking in its wider arcs, for
and limits our way of being. However, this context of meaning cannot be spoken
directly. It becomes present by virtue of what is said.
The dynamic of Erhard’s technology of language responds directly to issues
raised by Heidegger in his 1954 essay, “The Question Concerning Technology” (Basic
Writings). Technology’s essence, proposes Heidegger, is its relentless demand that
all of nature, including human beings, be placed in standing reserve, on call for the
uses of technology itself.  The way of being evoked by this development (i.e., that we
ourselves function as “calculable material” in a cybernetic system designed to serve
ourselves) poses the danger that we may become lost in the profound reflexivity of
that system, and, most fatally, may forget that anything has been lost. Surrender to
technology “threatens man with the possibility that it could be denied to him to en-
ter into a more original revealing and hence to experience the call of a more primal
truth” (“QCT” in BW 333). Such surrender, however, seems inevitable: the technolog-
W
ical epoch is where we have landed, the only way of being we have been provided,
and resistance is as futile as surrender is fatal.
But Heidegger suggests a middle path, a “comportment toward technology
which expresses ‘yes’ and at the same time ‘no’” (DT 54). Further, he proposes that
T
“essential reflection upon technology and decisive confrontation with it must hap-
pen in a realm that is, on the one hand, akin to the essence of technology, and, on
the other, fundamentally different from it”(“QCT” in BW 340). We suggest that Wer-
W
ner Erhard’s work provides such a realm. It is both a manifestation of the technolog-
ical epoch and a subversive appropriation of its impulse, a thinking which reaches
beyond the technological paradigm by reaching through that paradigm.
In Academia
For half a century, postmodern and poststructuralist theories across many disci-
plines have theorized a new freedom from the constraints of the Cartesian model
of human being. Human subjectivity has been decentered; the self is no longer
understood as the fixed and self-certain cogito but is open to creative reinvention;
language does not merely re-present a preexisting world of objective meanings, but
in fact generates the meanings that constitute that world.
These theoretical assertions concern being. But their effective communication
in the universities has been hindered by our epistemologically-based academic
tradition, which assumes that the central dynamic of education is knowing. This has
given rise to a pedagogical model in which the ontological domain must always re-
main merely conceptual, because being is not apprehended by knowing. The book’s

Burke, who, beyond their tireless support, have gathered together a generous read-
ing group. To the group, composed of Allan Cohen, Joe DiMaggio, Bruce Gregory,
Michael C. Jensen, Sigurfreyr Jonasson, David C. Logan, Nicholas Merton, Daniel
Rogerson, Steve Zaffron, and Michael E. Zimmerman—we want you to know our im-
measurable joy when we received feedback that could only come from the deepest
appreciation. For granting access to Landmark Worldwide’s archives to allow for the
production of an accurate and complete transcript, we thank Harry Rosenberg, Mick
Leavitt and Landmark Worldwide staff. To the Wiley team, including Shannon Vargo,
Sally Baker, Peter Knox, Deborah Schindlar, and Jocelyn Kwiatkowski: thank you for
taking a risk on this project—given its untraditional scope, design, and size—and
for taking such great care throughout all stages of bringing this book into the world.
To Lou Agosta, Jeff Bineham, Richard Doyle, Charles Guignon, Michael J. Hyde,
and Carolyne White—together with the members of Lecole book club—thank you
for reviewing and responding to the early versions of the manuscript; we hope your
thoughtful attention presages serious study of this rich rhetorical phenomenon
within such academic fields as rhetoric and writing studies, education, philosophy,
and communication studies.
Last, Bruce and I together stand in ovation to the man who has made, and will
continue to make, the difference for both of us and countless others—the difference
for all those who have had the opportunity, the gift, to be and speak with him—for
in the very act of speaking being we create possibility for ourselves and our lives.
Werner Erhard: Thank you for providing a way to say what otherwise remains
forever unsayable.
instance, the central theme of “the forgetting of Being,” which has eight parts.
Our purpose in this book is not to explain The Forum, or Heidegger’s philosophy—
although there are moments where we do provide analysis—but rather, we primarily
aim to engage the reader in thinking Erhard’s and Heidegger’s ideas for themselves.
For readers who have previously participated in The Forum, we believe the con-
fluence here of Heidegger’s thinking with Erhard’s will enrich the way those readers
hold their Forum experience.  This has been true for the authors, and it is likewise
consistent with the experience of Werner Erhard, for whom exposure to Heidegger’s
thinking provided profound insights (Erhard, interview with authors). We intend that
this book, in a dialogue with its readers, will evoke such insights.
Martin Heidegger once cautioned his students not to focus too closely on the
concepts in his lectures, but rather to follow the “movement of showing” (OTB 2).
The Forum conversation, we assert, is a carefully designed movement in language
for the showing of being. In this book, we will show that showing. Our goal—Heide-
gger’s, Erhard’s, the authors’—is the unconcealment of a powerful aspect of human
being with which we are, for the most part, unfamiliar.
While it may go without saying, reading this book will not provide an experience
of The Forum. We intend to hint at that experience, and we encourage readers for
whom our hints are provocative to seek out the experience for themselves. The Forum
occurs essentially as a dialogue; ontological inquiry demands interactive play, and
needs “the widest sphere in which to swing” (“DL” in OWL 27). In written form, Heideg-
ger warned, “the movement of the questioning that is called for here might too easily
congeal” (“DL” in OWL 50).
Nonetheless, as we undertake this project, the authors stand in the open ques-
tion: What is the possibility of communicating being? This is not a questioning that
seeks an answer; rather, the inquiry it generates persistently reflects the question
itself back upon the questioner, undermining comforting and limiting assumptions.
Thus we see it as a transformational question. We invite the reader to join us in this
inquiry.
Acknowledgments
It is impossible to list all those who have contributed significantly to the composi-
tion of this book; to do so with full integrity would mean naming all who have risked
what it means to hear the unsaid in what is said. In particular, our gratitude goes
to several extraordinary individuals without whom our work would have failed to
move beyond the planning stages, including first, Barbara Stevenson and Sheryl

از همان قلمرو ناگفته ، و این که مشخصات این دو
کابولار ها می توانند برای برقراری ارتباط با آن قلمرو ادغام شوند: "من یاد گرفتم
ارهارد گفت: از هایدگر ، "ظرافت آنچه را که من می گفتم روشن شده و
آنچه در آنجا وجود داشت قدرتمندتر شد. »(Erhard ، مصاحبه با نویسندگان)
بودن و توانایی آن ، هم در آموزش و هم در انجمن ، به طور مداوم و قدرت
با شکوه تجربه ای را که شرکت کنندگان تحول پیدا کردند ، بیرون می کشند. برانگیختگی
از این تجربه ، عنصر اساسی انجمن باقی مانده است. برخورد Erhard
با هایدگر واژگان را غنی کرد که در آن می توانست در آن بیشتر باشد
به طور مؤثر و ارتباط آن به طور مؤثرتر. فناوری
شکل این مطالعه تجزیه و تحلیل تطبیقی ​​خواهد بود: ما نشان خواهیم داد که
کار ورنر ارهارد به روشهای قابل توجهی با فلسفه مارتین هماهنگ است
هایدگر ، و این که مقایسه کار آنها تفکر هر دو را روشن می کند
مردان. ما نشان خواهیم داد که فرم دیالوگ این انجمن یک Dimen-Prective را معرفی می کند-
Sion of Heidegger's Vocabulary به گونه ای که خود هایدگر کار می کند ، کار می کند
در یک فرهنگ محدود دانشگاهی و سیاسی ، قادر به انجام آن نبود. ما پیشنهاد می کنیم
که گفتگوی انجمن بلاغت هستی شناختی است: صحبت کردن هدفمند
قارچ ها و زمینه ای از معنی را ارائه می دهند که اگر ناشناخته باقی بماند ، شکل می گیرد

وجود
پایان نامه این است که کار ورنر ارهارد دامنه هستی شناختی را در دسترس قرار می دهد
زبان ، به طوری که دلسرد کننده ذهنیت و نوآوری خود می تواند
به عنوان امکانات تجربه کنید نه اینکه صرفاً به عنوان تئوری در نظر گرفته شود. ما می دانیم که این مدل آموزشی از بسیاری جهات یک مدل رادیکال است ، داده شده است
قدرت فرضیات تعبیه شده در سنت ما ؛ اما هایدگر این را می گوید
تجربه با زبان در حوزه هستی شناختی همیشه به "جهش" نیاز دارد.
همانطور که نهادهای آموزشی ما به طور فزاینده ای برای ایجاد افتتاحیه برای این کشور تلاش می کنند
انسان در مواجهه با پیشرفت تکنولوژیکی ، ما استدلال می کنیم که اوضاع است
بحرانی ، و این یک جهش از این نوع است. برنامه کتاب
متن اصلی این کتاب ، واقع در ستون های چپ و راست در هر صفحه ،
آیا ترکیبی از دو منبع است: یادداشت هایی که توسط نویسنده ارشد هنگام مشاهده گرفته شده است
یک انجمن در سانفرانسیسکو به رهبری ورنر ارهارد در دسامبر 1989 و رونویسی-
فیلم ویدئویی از همان رویداد چهار روزه در دسترس نویسنده جوان در
موقعیت مکانی در بایگانی در سراسر جهان. در حالی که متن compre-
مکالمات جالب و دقیق از انجمن واقعی 1989 ، مهم است
تغییراتی که باید برای آن حساب شود. اول و مهمتر از همه ، همه نام ها بوده اند
به جز Werner Erhard تغییر یافته است ، و نام های واقعی فقط برای آن ها استفاده شده است
شرکت کننده هایی که بیش از یک یا دو بار با Erhard یا دو نفر دیگر صحبت می کنند-
Viduals رهبری دوره ("KIPP" و "WES"). علاوه بر این ، برخی از مکالمات
به خاطر فضا ویرایش شده یا خلاصه شده است. به عنوان مثال ، همه بحث ها
برخورد با دوره شش روزه ، قطع شده در سال 1990 ، حذف شده است. همچنین
مفقود شدن از متن جلسه عصر انجمن 1989 است: وجود داشت
بدون ضبط ویدیویی موجود از آن رویداد. با این حال ، این حذف قابل اصلاح است
برای خوانندگان علاقه مند اگر آنها در یک جلسه عصرانه از نشانه گذاری شرکت می کردند
انجمن ، جایی که شرکت کنندگان تجربه خود را از این دوره برای مهمانان به اشتراک می گذارند
خودشان دعوت شده اند. ما متنی را که همراه با متن یا "نوارهای جانبی" یا "فواصل" است ، می نامیم.
نوارهای جانبی در ستون های مرکزی بین صفحات چپ و راست رخ می دهد که
متن انجمن را در خانه قرار دهید ، و فواصل بین جلسات
البته و در پایان هر یک از چهار روز. در نوارهای کناری و فواصل
ایده های مرتبط از تفکر مارتین هایدگر هستند. گاهی اتصال
بین نوار کناری و متن همراه آن ممکن است آشکار باشد. گاهی
این ممکن است به صورت مورب ، به عنوان یک اشاره در پس زمینه در نظر گرفته شود. فواصل زمانی بیشتر است
به دلیل تمرکز بر تفکر هایدگر در قوس های گسترده تر ، برای این روش مورب است
و روش ما را محدود می کند. با این حال ، این زمینه معنا را نمی توان گفت
مستقیم. این امر به واسطه آنچه گفته می شود وجود دارد. پویایی فناوری زبان Erhard مستقیماً به موضوعات پاسخ می دهد
مطرح شده توسط هایدگر در مقاله خود در سال 1954 با عنوان "سوال در مورد فناوری" (اساسی
نوشته ها). ذات فناوری ، هایدگر ، تقاضای بی امان آن است که
تمام طبیعت ، از جمله انسانها ، در تماس با ایستاده قرار می گیرند.
خود از فناوری استفاده می کند. راه برانگیخته با این پیشرفت (یعنی ما که ما
خودمان به عنوان "ماده قابل محاسبه" در یک سیستم سایبرنتیک طراحی شده برای خدمت
خودمان) این خطر را ایجاد می کند که ممکن است در انعطاف پذیری عمیق گم شویم
این سیستم ، و ، از همه مهمتر ، ممکن است فراموش کند که هر چیزی از بین رفته است. تسلیم شدن به
فناوری "انسان را تهدید می کند که این احتمال وجود دارد که او را انکار کند
به یک آشکار ترین آشکار تر و از این رو برای تجربه فراخوان یک ابتدایی تر
حقیقت "(" QCT "در BW 333). با این حال ، چنین تسلیم اجتناب ناپذیر به نظر می رسد: فناوری-
حرف
دوره iCal جایی است که ما به زمین نشستیم ، تنها راه ارائه ما ،
و مقاومت به همان اندازه بیهوده است که تسلیم کشنده است. اما هایدگر یک مسیر میانه را پیشنهاد می کند ، "یک شرکت برای فناوری"
که بیان می کند "بله" و در عین حال "نه" (DT 54). علاوه بر این ، او آن را پیشنهاد می کند
حرف
"تأمل اساسی بر فناوری و رویارویی سرنوشت ساز با آن باید
قلم در قلمرو که از یک طرف شبیه به جوهر فناوری است ، و در
دیگری ، اساساً متفاوت از آن "(" QCT "در BW 340). ما پیشنهاد می کنیم که
حرف
کار Ner Erhard چنین قلمرو را فراهم می کند. این هم تجلی فن آوری است-
دوره ical و یک تخصیص خرابکارانه از انگیزه آن ، تفکر که می رسد
فراتر از الگوی فناوری با رسیدن به آن الگوی. در آکادمی
برای نیم قرن ، نظریه های پسامدرن و پساساختارگرایی در بسیاری از دیسک
پلینز آزادی جدیدی را از محدودیت های مدل دکارتی تئوریزه کرده است
از انسان ذهنیت انسانی شایسته بوده است. خود دیگر نیست
به عنوان cogito ثابت و خودآموز درک می شود اما برای بازآفرینی خلاق باز است.
زبان صرفاً یک دنیای موجود در معانی عینی را دوباره ارائه نمی دهد ، بلکه
در واقع معانی را که آن جهان را تشکیل می دهد ، ایجاد می کند. این ادعاهای نظری مربوط به بودن است. اما ارتباط مؤثر آنها
در دانشگاه ها توسط دانشگاهی مبتنی بر معرفت شناختی مانع شده است
سنت ، که فرض می کند پویای اصلی آموزش و پرورش می داند. این
با توجه به یک مدل آموزشی که در آن دامنه هستی شناختی همیشه باید دوباره انجام شود
اصلی صرفاً مفهومی است ، زیرا وجود با دانستن دستگیر نمی شود. کتاب

Burke ، که فراتر از حمایت خستگی ناپذیر خود ، خواندن سخاوتمندانه ای را جمع کرده اند
گروه به گروه ، متشکل از آلن کوهن ، جو دی مگیگیو ، بروس گرگوری ،
مایکل سی. جنسن ، سیگورفیریر جانسون ، دیوید سی لوگان ، نیکلاس مرتون ، دانیل
راجرسون ، استیو زفرون و مایکل ا. زیمرمن- ما می خواهیم شما را بدانید
شادی قابل اندازه گیری هنگامی که بازخوردی دریافت کردیم که فقط از عمیق ترین آنها ناشی می شود
قدردانی اعطای دسترسی به بایگانی در سراسر جهان برای اجازه دادن به
تولید یک نسخه دقیق و کامل ، ما از هری روزنبرگ ، میک تشکر می کنیم
کارکنان Leavitt و Landmark در سراسر جهان. به تیم ویلی ، از جمله شانون وارگو ،
سالی بیکر ، پیتر ناکس ، دبورا شیندلار و جوکلین کویاتکوفسکی: از شما متشکرم
با ریسک کردن در این پروژه - به دامنه ، طراحی و اندازه غیر سنتی خود - و
برای مراقبت بسیار زیاد در تمام مراحل ورود این کتاب به جهان. به لو آگوستا ، جف بینام ، ریچارد دویل ، چارلز گیونون ، مایکل جی. هاید ،
و کارولین وایت - در کنار اعضای باشگاه کتاب لکول - از شما متشکرم
برای بررسی و پاسخ به نسخه های اولیه نسخه خطی ؛ ما امیدواریم شما
توجه متفکرانه مطالعه جدی این پدیده بلاغی غنی را نشان می دهد
در زمینه های دانشگاهی مانند لفاظی و مطالعات نوشتن ، آموزش ، فلسفه ،
و مطالعات ارتباطی آخر ، من و بروس با هم در حال تخمدان با مردی هستیم که ساخته است و اراده خواهد کرد
تفاوت را برای هر دو ما و دیگران بی شماری ادامه دهید - تفاوت
برای همه کسانی که این فرصت را دارند ، هدیه ، با او صحبت می کنند و صحبت می کنند -
در همان عمل صحبت کردن ، ما برای خود و زندگی خود امکان ایجاد می کنیم. ورنر ارهارد: از شما متشکرم که راهی برای گفتن آنچه در غیر این صورت باقی مانده است ارائه دادید
برای همیشه غیرقابل تحمل. به عنوان مثال ، موضوع اصلی "فراموشی بودن" که هشت قسمت دارد. هدف ما در این کتاب توضیح این انجمن یا فلسفه هایدگر نیست.
اگرچه لحظاتی وجود دارد که ما تجزیه و تحلیل را ارائه می دهیم - بلکه در درجه اول ما
هدف این است که خواننده را در فکر کردن ایده های Erhard و Heidegger برای خود درگیر کند. برای خوانندگانی که قبلاً در این انجمن شرکت کرده اند ، ما معتقدیم
تسلط در اینجا از تفکر هایدگر با Erhard ، شیوه آن خوانندگان را غنی می کند
تجربه انجمن خود را حفظ کنید. این برای نویسندگان صادق بوده است ، و به همین ترتیب است
مطابق با تجربه ورنر ارهارد ، که برای آنها در معرض هایدگر قرار دارد
تفکر بینش های عمیقی ارائه داد (Erhard ، مصاحبه با نویسندگان). ما قصد داریم که
این کتاب در گفتگو با خوانندگان خود ، چنین بینشی را برانگیخته است. مارتین هایدگر یک بار دانش آموزان خود را هشدار داد که بیش از حد از نزدیک تمرکز نکنند
مفاهیم در سخنرانی های او ، بلکه پیروی از "حرکت نمایش" (OTB 2). ما ادعا می کنیم مکالمه انجمن حرکتی با دقت طراحی شده به زبان است
برای نمایش هستی در این کتاب ، این نمایش را نشان خواهیم داد. هدف ما- اوید-
Gger ، Erhard ، نویسندگان - عدم موفقیت یک جنبه قدرتمند از انسان است
با وجود ما ، بیشتر از همه ، ناآشنا هستیم. در حالی که ممکن است بدون گفتن باشد ، خواندن این کتاب تجربه ای را ارائه نمی دهد
از انجمن ما قصد داریم به آن تجربه اشاره کنیم و خوانندگان را به دنبال آن تشویق می کنیم
چه کسی نکات ما تحریک آمیز است تا تجربه خود را برای خودشان جستجو کند. انجمن
اساساً به عنوان گفتگو اتفاق می افتد. تحقیق هستی شناختی خواستار بازی تعاملی است ، و
به "وسیع ترین کره ای که در آن نوسان" ("DL" در OWL 27) نیاز دارد. به صورت کتبی ، هایدگ-
گر هشدار داد ، "حرکت سؤال که در اینجا فراخوانده می شود ممکن است خیلی راحت
Congeal "(" DL "در OWL 50). با این وجود ، همانطور که ما این پروژه را انجام می دهیم ، نویسندگان در سؤال باز ایستاده اند
TION: امکان برقراری ارتباط وجود دارد؟ این یک سوال نیست که
به دنبال جواب است در عوض ، پرس و جو که باعث ایجاد مداوم می شود این سوال را منعکس می کند
خود به سؤال کننده برگردد و فرضیات آرامش بخش و محدود کننده را تضعیف کند. بنابراین ما آن را به عنوان یک سوال تحول گرا می دانیم. ما خواننده را دعوت می کنیم تا در این مورد به ما بپیوندد
استعلام تصدیق
لیست کردن همه کسانی که به طور قابل توجهی در این ترکیب مشارکت داشته اند غیرممکن است
این کتاب ؛ انجام این کار با یکپارچگی کامل به معنای نامگذاری همه افراد خطرناک است
معنای شنیدن ناآگاهانه در آنچه گفته می شود چیست. به طور خاص ، قدردانی ما می رود
به چندین فرد خارق العاده که بدون آنها کار ما نتوانسته است
فراتر از مراحل برنامه ریزی ، از جمله اول ، باربارا استیونسون و شریل
