Forum Day One: Session Two

(turning to The Forum Supervisor)
Julie, would you ask Eric to get the Heidegger books out of my room.
(returning to the blackboard, and pointing to the circle labeled “story”)
I want to take back making this bad. What’s disempowering is not the story, what’s disempow-
ering is when you collapse “what happened” with the “story” and you can’t distinguish the story
from what happened. You can’t distinguish because you’ve got this mush, this mess, this swamp
of what happened and the story mixed together. The two need to be distinct. What does distinct
mean? It means existing then on their own, being there of themselves. It’s possible for Vietnam
to exist as a story and it’s possible for Vietnam to exist as a what happened. They’re two distinct
realms of existence. Sometimes the story is appropriate, sometimes what happened is appropri-
ate. What’s never appropriate is when these two distinctions get collapsed.
As this conversation developed, Erhard added other terms to his blackboard model. In the right
circle, below “what happened,” he wrote “presence” and “I’m late.” In the other, below “story,” was
written “concept” and “reasons.”
ERHARD
Confusing what happened with your story about it is like ordering steak and then mixing the
steak with the menu. Most people think life is sour because they’ve been eating the menu for
so long, they don’t recognize reading the menu. You should not say “I love you” to people. You
should say, “I live with the concept ‘I love you.’” Love as a concept is sometimes important, but
t
it isn’t the same as love as a presence. What falls out of my mouth when I say “chair” is a con-
cept. It’s not a chair—but it’s useful. Just separating the two domains of existence in any area of
your life will leave you with more power in that area. For this to work, try it on in your own life.
This is not the truth. Try it on. If it works, good; if not, throw it away.
At this point, The Forum Supervisor brought Erhard a copy of Heidegger’s What is Called Thinking?
(1968, pages 76-77). He spent a minute looking for the passage he wanted, and fi nally turned back
to her.
ERHARD
This is the wrong copy. This is not the copy I can fi nd things in. I have two marked copies and I
can fi nd things in one and not the other.
Julie brought up the correct copy.
ERHARD (beginning to read)
“People still hold the view that what is handed down to us by tradition is what in reality lies
behind us—while in fact it comes toward us because we are its captives and destined to it.”
(pausing)
We think we’re out in front of tradition on the leading edge. He’s talking about where the rub-
ber meets the road. This is not some fancy talk.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (loudly)
He’s talking about your future. He’s saying you’ve got no future. Your future is constituted by
the past. Listen up! This is not a guy in a diner, by the way.
(shifting tone)
Where’s the person I had that conversation with?
Doris, with whom he had earlier discussed whether she knew her “ass from a hole in the ground,”
stood.
ERHARD
Did I leave you insulted, by the way?
(Doris looking hesitant)
Can I withdraw the insult? Will you forgive me?
(nodding, she then sits)
Thank you.
(continuing to read)
“The purely historical view of tradition and the course of history is one of those vast self-de-
ceptions in which we must remain entangled as long as we are still not really thinking. That
self-deception about history prevents us from hearing the language of the thinkers. We do not
hear it rightly, because we take that language to be mere expression, setting forth philosophers’
views.”
(to the group)
Some people are actually thinking, and speaking their thinking. That’s diff erent from “saying
g
what you’ve got on your mind.” But the thinkers’ language tells what it is. And hearing it is in
no case easy. Hearing it presupposes that we meet a certain requirement, and we do so only on
rare occasions. So there’s a requirement to be able to hear thinking. And you can bet your hat,
ass, and overcoat that the same requirement exists for thinking. And here’s the requirement.
(continuing to read)
“We must acknowledge and respect it. To acknowledge and respect consists in letting ev-
ery thinker’s thought come to us as something in each case unique, never to be repeated,
inexhaustible.”
(to the group)
You will notice that everything that has been said in here today you have associated with
something else. In order to have it live by itself, you have to think. Association happens anyhow,
because you’re not doing it. It’s doing it.
“
Your future is constituted by the past.
