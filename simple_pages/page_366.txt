SPEAKING BEING
JOYCE
Yes. It’s clear.
ERHARD
So, don’t do that anymore. Cut that out. Stop rejecting it. Stop trying to get better. Stop trying to 
change your life. What is it you want out of life, that’s so goddamned important that you want 
to change your life? What is it that’s bothering you because it’s missing?
JOYCE
I want to like myself. I don’t like myself.
ERHARD
Okay. Now. Start not liking yourself. Do that right now. Don’t like yourself right now.
(Joyce laughing)
What are you smiling about? I thought you said you didn’t like yourself.
(laughter)
Don’t like yourself some more. This is pretty good. Now don’t like yourself even more. You 
notice everything changed. Now like yourself. Like yourself. 
JOYCE
It’s not diff erent.
ERHARD
It’s no fucking diff erent is it?
(laughter)
Liking yourself and not liking yourself are the same thing: It’s all bullshit. 
(raising his voice to a pitch)
What is this goddamned fantasy about liking yourself? What in the fuck is that? That’s crazy! 
That’s like walking around saying “Don’t look! Don’t look! Oh my God there’s a man back there 
following me with a knife with blood dripping down.” Bullshit people made up: liking your-
self/not liking yourself. You know what not liking yourself is? It’s a conversation you have with 
yourself. Bullshit people made up, this “liking yourself/not liking yourself.” You know what 
not liking yourself is? It’s a conversation you have with yourself. 
JOYCE
It’s a conversation I constantly have with myself.
ERHARD
Yeah, but stop it then. This is craziness. What is the signifi cance of liking yourself or not liking 
yourself? Does it change a hair on your head?
