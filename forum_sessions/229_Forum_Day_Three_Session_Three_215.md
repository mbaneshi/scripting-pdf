Forum Day Three: Session Three 215
Erhard sat on the edge of the platform as he interacted with Tony, watching him intently.
TONY
Empowering others is what I want to do in life.
ERHARD
And when you do it, you do it, and when you don’t, you don’t. And that’s the whole story.
TONY
I just want to keep doing it.
ERHARD (raising his voice and standing up to approach Tony)
You will if you do and you won’t if you don’t. And if you make it the Holy Grail you’ll make it
into a fucking joke.
TONY (laughing)
Okay...
ERHARD
You get it?
TONY
Okay, so I won’t make it the Holy Grail.
ERHARD (sitting down again)
Yes you will. See, you just turned not making it into another making it. “I won’t make it! That’s
the way I’ll make it, by not making it. That’s my new making it, that’s what’s going to get me
over the wall.”
TONY
I’m not ever thinking about the wall, I just want to do...
ERHARD
So what? You want, so what?
TONY
Okay.
ERHARD
The stars don’t move for “you want.”

SPEAKING BEING
TONY
I’m okay with that.
ERHARD
Almost. You’re close to okay with that.
TONY
I just enjoy empowering others, and I discovered this recently...
ERHARD
So what? And you got hair.
TONY
Okay.
ERHARD
But you got it more than you got hair! You got it like some big goddamned thing.
TONY
Yeah I do.
ERHARD
No, it’s a fart.
(laughter)
TONY
Look, I just discovered this for myself.
ERHARD
In about three minutes you’re going to be real deep in this thing. With your foot nailed to the
fl oor about empowering others.
TONY
I discovered that’s what I want to do in life.
ERHARD
So what?
TONY
Okay, so what?
