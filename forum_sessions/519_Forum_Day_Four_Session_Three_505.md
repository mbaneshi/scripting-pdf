Forum Day Four: Session Three 505
ERHARD (continuing to laughter)
That’s you. You’re “oh shit!” That’s how we know when you got back.
(laughter; indicating third empty circle)
So a lot of what the second half of The Forum is about is access to this domain. And you and I
are not going to do as good a job at access to that domain as you were getting to zero, because
you all were a pain in the ass and it took too long to get to zero. If you didn’t hear me making
you wrong, I was just making you wrong.
(laughter)
The other side of that is that we haven’t gotten our shit together to get The Forum to zero
quickly enough to do a good job on the second half. That’s making me wrong. You notice
nothing changes, no matter who’s wrong?
(laughter and applause)
The point is that we can’t do very much more than open up the second half of The Forum.
That’s as much as we can get done, because you all need your beauty sleep.
(laughter)
Okay, so what is this domain? If it’s not experiential, and it isn’t; it’s not conceptual, and it isn’t:
What is that domain?
(writing “possibility” in the third circle)
Simple. It’s the domain of possibility. Not this possibility or that possibility,
(indicating the “story” circle)
...that’s here. You could say that it’s the possibility of possibility. But there’s no such domain.
No matter where you go to look for it you can’t fi nd it. You can’t have it unless you invent it.
You have to invent the possibility of possibility. You want to listen to that. People don’t have
possibility in their lives. They have options. Options are futures generated from the past. The
past could work out like this, or it could work out like that. You know, common conversation
between people. Things could work out like this, or they could work out like that. “They’re
likely to work out like this, but oh boy would I love them to work out like that, but that is
not very likely.” That is not possibility; that is “options.” Options are conceptual. And your
experience—listen up—your experience will mostly be limited to the options that you give
yourself to experience. It’s the vicious circle all over again.
(indicating the “story” circle)
The options are here. Why do I call them options? Because they’re derived from your past
experiences! The options shape your future experience. And the option-shaped experiences
reinforce the options. So now you fi nally got yourself fi gured out so you don’t need to get
up in the morning anymore, because there’s nowhere to go. Why bother? You already know
how it’s going to be, so why bother? The only reason why most of you get up is because you
506
SPEAKING BEING
like suff ering. That’s a psychiatric problem called masochism. Go to a psychiatrist to get that
handled. We don’t handle that in here. But most of you get up because you like suff ering. I
mean, you must like suff ering: That’s what you do. And you know you’re going to do it. No,
what gets you up is hoping, hoping you’re going to make it, hoping it’s all going to work out,
hoping it’s somehow going to be diff erent, hoping you’re going to get the answer. What’s that?
(in response to a participant calling out, Erhard repeats)
Yeah. You suff er hoping. Exactly. Hoping keeps you suff ering. Why would you bother getting up
in the morning if you know what it’s going to be like?
(walking back to the chalkboard to indicate the “possibility” circle)
At any rate, you’ve got something to say here. You’ve got nothing to say about experience—you
can only report on it more or less accurately.
(indicating the “story” circle)
And you’re limited to what you say here reporting on experience. This is reporting on that.
(indicating the “possibility” circle)
Here you are free. Now, there’s one little catch. A pipe dream is not a possibility. Pipe dreams
and possibility are not the same thing. Possibility is the future. You could say that the past could
have possibly been like this. But in the future, we might learn that the past was really diff erent
than what we thought. Possibility is always future. It’s got that kind of temporality: future. And
you’re going to have pipe dreams and call them possibility. I’ll tell you how to tell the diff erence
between a pipe dream and possibility. There is no future, which will ever be realized, which is
not an extension of the past when it happens. All futures will be an extension of the past. There
are no discontinuous futures. Not in your lifetime, because all futures, when realized, have a
continuity with the past. There is nothing that ever happened that was inconsistent with the
past. If necessary, the past is rewritten. On the basis of Columbus and Einstein, the past was
rewritten. See, it was true the world was fl at, until someone did something inconsistent with
that. Then we said, oh, it wasn’t fl at. How the hell do you know it wasn’t fl at? The point is that
you’re free to create possibilities for your life and you want to ground those possibilities by
bringing the possibility back into the present. Like standing in the future to create a future. And
then you tease it back to the present, so there’s a structure to fulfi ll that possibility. But that’s too
technical, and we don’t have the time to go into all the technicalities tonight. All I’m going to
tell you is this: If you live with possibility, you live with both risk and power. None of this works;
it’s only empowering. None of this is the answer, and it is empowering. Life is authentically
risky. You got the wrong idea about life. You think life is about reducing the risk with fi nding the
answers. You want to cheat. If you want to reduce the risk, play tennis with three-year-olds. You
win all the time. Makes you feel great.
(laughter)
If winning all the time makes you feel great then you like playing tennis with three-year-olds.
Winning doesn’t make people feel great. Being powerful and able and playing and dancing,
that makes people feel great. And to do that you’ve got to have power, and that’s what we’re
ERHARD (continuing)
All I’m going to tell you is this: If you live with
possibility, you live with both risk and power.
None of this works; it’s only empowering. None
of this is the answer, and it is empowering. Life
is authentically risky.
