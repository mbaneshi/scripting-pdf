SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
So there was a loss of relationship?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
A certain loss of love.
MIKE
Loss of my self.
ERHARD
You lost self-expression. You cut off  that avenue of self-expression called intelligence.
MIKE
Okay.
ERHARD
What about happiness?
MIKE
I was sad that I couldn’t make my dad happy.
ERHARD
Got it.
MIKE
I still don’t understand why the whole crowd was laughing at the beginning.
ERHARD
I don’t know. Why were they laughing at the beginning? 
KIPP
They laughed when he stood up and said he didn’t know what his racket was.
ERHARD
Mike, you’ve been in here for a little while right? People thought I was insulting when I called
them assholes. That was like a “damned with faint praise,” not an insult. Asshole is a fairly high
level. People are really stupid. Are you tuned in?
