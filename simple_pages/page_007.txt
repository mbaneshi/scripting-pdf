To the students in my Communication Studies classes at St. Cloud State University, who for the past twenty-five years have been 
my partners in the play and mystery of ontological inquiry; and to my wife Susan Saetre, my constant guardian angel.
BRUCE
To my friend and writing partner, Bruce Hyde (1941-2015), who blazed a trail with his unrelenting commitment to communicate 
the unsaid. What a gift  to have worked with a man of such brilliance, humor, and courage, even unto death, and with this book,
Bruce will continue to speak to each reader willing to take up the call to enter the conversation this book is but a fragment of.
I also dedicate this book to my students, ever my co-experimenters in the inquiry of what it means to be a writer and a reader; 
and to my wife Cindy, and my children, Tristan and Cassidy: I dedicate the fruits of my labor to your future.
