BEVERLY
And so now we’re going to progress somewhere?
(laughter)
ERHARD
No no. See, if we progress somewhere then we’d have to get back to zero again.
BEVERLY

should give you a very powerful sense of freedom. And take a great big burden there and let you 
be with the relationship you already have.
