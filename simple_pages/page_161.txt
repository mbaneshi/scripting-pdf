Forum Day Two: Session Three 147
ERHARD
But you don’t care about having a marriage that would last forever. All you care about is what 
validates you as a caring, sincere, deeply feeling person. 
ANGEL
That would do it.
ERHARD
Yeah exactly, but you see, you don’t care about being married. You really don’t care about being 
married. You don’t. If God came into the room and said, if you dyed your hair purple, that
would make it clear to everyone that you are a deeply caring, sincere, feeling person, hell, you’d 
be out there dyeing your hair purple. To hell with getting married. That’s your act. Your act is
that you’re sincere, deeply feeling, and a caring person. That’s an act with you. That’s not what
you are. Mike is not stupid. Mike has an act called “being stupid.”
ANGEL
So his father gave him his act.
ERHARD
No, no. He gave himself his act to deal with his father. Never mind that. Here’s what I want you 
to get: Mike is not stupid. Mike’s got an act called being stupid. You don’t care. You’ve got an act
called “I care” and you’re not deeply feeling. That’s an act. And you’re not sincere. That’s also an
act.
ANGEL
I believe he’s not stupid. 
ERHARD
And you don’t care. Now that’s not quite accurate. So listen up. It’s worse than that. I don’t
mean that you don’t care like “I don’t care.” I mean you are not caring. That’s an act. What you
call caring is a fucking act. Why are you afraid of not caring?
ANGEL
It would make me a bad person.
ERHARD
Who didn’t care? 
ANGEL
It’s the opposite.
ERHARD
Who?
