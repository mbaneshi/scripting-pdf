SPEAKING BEING
(laughter)
Here is what to do when people say that stuff  to you.
(to Ed)
This time take the dictionary.
(as Kipp attacks once more)
“I think you’re stupid and weird.”
(Ed takes the dictionary away)
That’s your job. So when people say that stuff , your job is to be with them. Chocolate: choose. 
When you get a whole big pile of dictionaries, we turn around and put them down, and say, 
what else you got? Peacocks are these gorgeous birds. Do you know what peacocks eat? They 
eat poison off  the ground. If you want to make a diff erence in people’s lives, you’ve got to be 
willing to eat their poison. Thank you Ed.
(Ed sits to applause)
And, you’re going to get stuck with some dictionaries. You’re going to notice in the middle of 
a conversation with somebody, all of a sudden, you’ll be resisting what they are saying. You 
notice that in the middle of a conversation, you can say, “I got hooked. Here’s what I want to 
say.” I invite you not to stop. You can make a real contribution to the people in your lives this 
weekend. Another thing: Whatever emergencies come up for you, whatever can normally stop 
you in life, don’t get stopped. Be at your Forum Evening Session, and complete The Forum for 
yourself.  
The fourth day of The Forum ended.
