SPEAKING BEING
GLORIA
I keep trying to bring morality into this.
ERHARD
The drama of morality... 
GLORIA
Like what she said: If life is empty and meaningless, why produce?
ERHARD
Why produce if life is empty and meaningless?
GLORIA
Not if...
ERHARD
Given that life is empty and meaningless, why produce? There is no reason to produce. Except 
for one thing, Gloria: You did not hear that life was empty and meaningless. You’ve been in 
a conversation with other people and not with me. See, “life is empty and meaningless” does 
not tell you what to do with your life. It gives you no guidance at all, none. My “empty and 
meaningless” is worthless. Your “empty and meaningless” gives you guidance. So your “empty 
and meaningless” tells you that going on is worthless. My “empty and meaningless” tells me 
nothing, gives no prescriptions, explains nothing, justifi es nothing. That’s the “empty and 
meaningless” we’re talking about here. The “empty and meaningless” you’re talking about is 
not the one I’m talking about. Out of your “empty and meaningless” you get a meaning about 
what you should do, you get a prescription for what you should do for your life. My “empty and 
meaningless” has no prescriptions in it. You went to the seminar on the other side of the wall. 
Over there they got a seminar about empty and meaningless and it tells you what to do with 
your life. 
GLORIA
I can understand it intellectually. 
ERHARD
What does that mean “intellectually”? I don’t understand “intellectually.”
GLORIA
I understand it makes sense.
