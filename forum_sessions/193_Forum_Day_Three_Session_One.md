Forum Day Three: Session One

ERHARD
And standing in the love that was there. Not a bad place to stand—talking about power. What
you call love is not love: it’s love in-order-to; love to keep somebody around; or love to get
something out of them; love because you need. That’s not love. When you take everything
else away, what is left is love. When you take away “I was a twit,” and take away him being
arrogant, what you’re left with is love for each other. And it doesn’t mean anything, but it’s
extraordinarily powerful. And you can stand there and really make something happen in life—
like really create something worth creating. Fabulous.
SUSAN
During dinner last night I was expressing things that had bothered me before, and he said, “I
think it should be a requirement for spouses, that when one takes it the other should take
The Forum.”
ERHARD
We like it to get bad fi rst, though. Makes it clearer about what you’re up to if it gets bad fi rst.
SUSAN
I know because listening to everybody else yesterday, things they wanted to fi x, and I didn’t
think I had anything--I just haven’t lived long enough.
ERHARD
You know, we do this with children. They’re as fucked up as you are. They’ve got all the same
stuff  as you going on and they’re in the process of building their identity. And I’m probably one
of the few people in the world who’s an expert on teenagers. And I know almost nothing about
teenagers. The truth about teenagers is that they’re human. People are insulted when I say that.
But when you live with a teenager, you’re not sure.
(laughter)
The truth is that teenagers are adults. That’s hard to get, because they’re a weird kind of adult.
They’re adults who don’t have their act together well enough to get it bought all the time. And
it’s very painful to get called on your act. Very painful. Adults are teenagers with their act so
well put together that they almost never get called on it. Very simple and very powerful.
SUSAN
I see that as I was looking for a job I was afraid of telling my husband for fear he might make
me continue if it didn’t work out.
KIPP
Yeah, don’t establish a network of support for yourself.
SUSAN
He might force me: “Just in case it doesn’t feel good you can jump right out.”

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Susan brought up something important about living in fear all the time. The truth you’re going
to fi nd out today is that you live in fear all the time. It’s so pervasive that for you it’s become
ordinary. So it’s only when you’re overwhelmed by fear that you notice that you’re frightened.
But the fear is there all the time: “afraid I might get stuck with this”; “afraid I might get boxed
in.” It’s there all the time. This is an experiment to see what it looks like to live in fear and don’t
call it that. Call it “everyday living.” The more forceful you are, the more frightened you are.
You’re just overcompensating for the fear, so to speak. Why do you suppose it takes courage?
The more frightened you are the more courage you need. The more forceful you are the more
frightened you are.
SUSAN
I’m not really sure. I keep being confused. My natural tendency is to want to fi x it.
ERHARD
No, it’s not your natural tendency; it’s its natural tendency.
SUSAN
Its natural tendency. I keep looking for something.
ERHARD
Right, to try to fi x it. And whatever you try to fi x gets permanent-ized.
SUSAN
I can’t wait to be able to share equally with my husband.
ERHARD
Well done. Just one point about not sharing in-order-to. Sharing attracts. Looking good ensnares,
and sharing attracts. You don’t build relationships talking about what you think. You build
relationships by speaking yourself, and listening self; listening for the self there, not listening
for the story there. If you listen for self, people will speak their selves. If you listen for crap, people
will tell you their crap. If you listen for self, people will tell you their crap fi rst, but they’ll get
around to speaking themselves.
A young man named Andy, wearing a sweatshirt with the logo “Youth at Risk” (a project of Werner
Erhard and Associates), rose.
ANDY
I am a lowdown mother-fucking sleeze.
ERHARD
What do you have to do with Youth at Risk?
ANDY
I work there.
