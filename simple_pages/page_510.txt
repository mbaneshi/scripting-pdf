SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (throwing the ball just out of Mike’s reach)
Why did you put your hand up there when I threw the ball? 
MIKE
To catch the ball.
ERHARD
No you didn’t. Did you say, “I’m going to catch this ball?”
MIKE
To myself I did.
ERHARD
Did you really?
MIKE
Yes I did.
ERHARD (throwing the ball again out of Mike’s range)
What did you say then?
MIKE
I said...
ERHARD
You didn’t say a goddamned thing! Nothing. Afterwards, in the moment afterwards, you might 
have said, “that’s not catchable.” If the ball was catchable for you, you would have reached over. 
And you may or may not have caught it, but you would have reached over. Are you athletic?
(pausing)
Stop thinking! Are you athletic or not?
MIKE
I’m neither.
ERHARD
You’re a person for whom the ball is slow and fat. And I’m a person for whom the ball is very 
small and fast. And the slower the ball goes, the more athletic you look. Is that clear?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
Very good. Thanks.
