Forum Day Four: Session One
341
KEVIN
So to this young person who doesn’t have much time left to get something out of this Forum.
ERHARD
Never mind the editorial.
KEVIN
This person is looking forward to really getting the job done at the next event, because this
person’s talking about the next event, where this person’s going to get the job done. And I don’t
think this person’s going to get the job done in the next event unless they start right now get-
ting the job done at this event. That’s what I have to say.
(applause)
WES
Kevin, I appreciate your generosity, so I’m gonna share a poem with you.
Here Wes read the e e cummings poem, “What gets you is nothing.”
WES (completing the poem)
So you’ve been gotten, and what got you is nothing. It is inescapable. What there is to be gotten
by—to be used by—in The Forum is nothing. If that now sounds like possibility to you, if now
you hear that communication as possibility—you don’t understand it...
KEVIN
I feel like I understand it.
WES
Maybe you do. I’m saying, even if you don’t. If it just has that sense of possibility to it, raise
your hand.
(most of the participants raising their hands)
How many don’t?
(a few raising their hands)
Okay. So are you complete Kevin?
KEVIN
No. I still have my homework assignment.
WES
Those who don’t: Your job is to transform the conversation we’re having now, somehow, into
possibility. You notice that a lot of people in the room have done that. That’s your job now.
Your job. That’s where the value of your money occurs.

SPEAKING BEING
KEVIN (almost crying now)
I did my assignment; I almost didn’t do it. I called my wife this morning. I had forgotten that I
was supposed to ask her if I was selfi sh. So I asked her if I’m selfi sh. Her fi rst response was to
laugh.
(laughter)
It wasn’t a big laugh.
(bigger laughter)
I really mean that, I wasn’t trying to be cute I don’t think. But it was a genuine laugh. And I
wasn’t quite sure what that was going to be followed by. And she paused for a minute and was
thinking. And then she said, “Well, you do have to have control.” And so I was sitting there
dealing with that. And then she said “But you’ve got a lot of good qualities to off set it.” I’m not
trying not to cry. I don’t know what I’m trying to do. I’ve certainly never cried in front of a
group like this.
Let me tell you something. Anytime you actually meet yourself, it’ll move you to tears.
KEVIN
Well I’m not worried about crying. In some respects I wish I could cry.
ERHARD
That’s close enough. What you’re doing is fi ne.
KEVIN
So I told her I loved her and she told me she loved me and that was the end. I’m complete.
Thanks.
ERHARD
Good.
(long applause)
WES
Just because we’re committed to you, we’re going to give those of you who raised your hand,
those of you who didn’t get possibility yet, we’re going to give you one more shot at waking the
fuck up.
(laughter)
ERHARD  (lightly)
No scatological language, Wes, please.
What is Said When Conscience Calls?
The call of conscience is a calling to listen past the hubbub and
to be brought back to one’s Self, but the “they” is not entirely
circumvented; one cannot leap over what it means to be human.
Rather, the “they” self plays an essential role:
But the fact that the call passes over both the
r
“they” and the manner in which Dasein has
been publicly interpreted, does not by any
means signify that the “they” is not reached
too. Precisely in passing over the “they” (keen
r
as it is for public repute) the call pushes it into
insignificance. But the Self, which the appeal
has robbed of this lodgment and hiding-place,
gets brought to itself by the call. (BT 317
