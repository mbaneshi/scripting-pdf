Forum Day Four: Session One

end of that exercise, you will be in touch with, you will have a deep insight into the profound
indiff erence the universe has for your opinion.
(laughter)
And then you can do something else with your life instead of fi guring out what you agree with
and what you don’t agree with. That would give you a lot of time, because right now you are
spending a lot of time fi guring out what you agree with and what you don’t agree with, and what
you like and what you don’t like, and what you want and what you don’t want. Very important to
know that the stars won’t move for your opinions. They will not move. They’ll move for some-
thing, but not for your opinion. And you’re pretty stuck with your opinion. You know, with what
you think is right and what you think is wrong, and which way you think it ought to be done and
which way you don’t think it ought to be done. You watch the stars carefully, like I said, you will
have a profound insight into the awesome indiff erence with which the universe holds your opin-
ion. Then you can use your life for something else. The stars will move, but not for your opinion.
Very good what you said. Thank you for letting me interrupt you. Please go on.
JEB
It gave me an opportunity to observe myself doing it because it came in the context of empty
and meaningless, and so I could retrace the steps. Like this: “Life is empty and meaningless.
Okay I could see the value in that. It gives you the freedom you spoke of, all of those things. I
can like that idea.” So what I saw happen was, I could incorporate that without challenging the
structure of my life. I could make that something I like, give it that meaning without upsetting
the way I do business.
KIPP
You see what he’s saying? It can be absorbed into the conventional wisdom. It would be an
extension of what you already knew. If you put this as an extension of what you already know,
it will be more of what you already know. Very powerful what Jeb is saying. “Oh, yeah, I agree
that it’s empty and meaningless. And of course, when I don’t agree with it, it won’t be.” See, you
don’t have any wants. You are your wants. Somebody tries to take your wants away from you,
you will act like they are trying to take you away from you. Yes?
WALKER
I got that I am complete with my mother but not with my father. And I began to look at that
and I saw that I thought that my father owed me something. Who I’d been being with my father
was that he owed me something. I called him up during the meal break last night, and just
apologized for being somebody who thought that he owed me something. And he said, “Well
what is it you thought I owed you.” And I said that I couldn’t even think of it, but that I just
wanted to apologize for that. He said: “apology accepted.” And that was that, and afterwards I
began to see that the other side of that is that if who I’ve been being is that he owes me some-
thing... the other side of that is that I’ve been being someone who owes somebody something. I
have something to complete with you, Werner. In 1974, I couldn’t say it then, but what I got was
what my life could be about. Everything since then has been about how I could pay you back,
The Uncanny
Approaching the final stages of writing this book, the authors
also were faced with another “end”: in January of 2015, Bruce
Hyde, the senior author, was diagnosed with a recurring and
aggressive cancer. A new urgency emerged, as the very existence
of our project was called into question. The “end” itself was
addressing us, calling us, summoning forth a whole new clearing
for partnership and activity, and in that clearing this book in its
entirety emerged with the senior author free to complete the
remainder of the sidebars and intervals, doing so before he was
unable to participate any longer.

SPEAKING BEING
like in order to pay you back for this gift you’ve given me. And what I got yesterday is that I
don’t owe you anything. I owe you nothing. And you’ve always told me “you owe me nothing.”
But I couldn’t quite get that without this piece of it. And now I’m wholly complete with that I
owe you nothing. And I am complete that I am participating in this work to pay you back for
something or in order to something...
ERHARD
You can’t give when you owe. Paying back is not a very powerful expression. Giving is a more
powerful expression than paying back.
WALKER
So we’re even.
ERHARD  (to laughter)
Deal. By the way I didn’t say I owed you nothing. I said I promised you nothing. It’s a
throwaway.
WALKER
In a very real way, who you have been being for me is my father. Like trying to get something
from you, trying to pay something back to you. So I want to thank you for the opportunity to be
in The Forum and the opportunity to complete that.
ERHARD
Thank you.
KIPP
See, participation begins when you have no reason to participate. What you call participation
has always been in-order-to... That’s not participation. That’s some kind of entanglement. Some
kind of a deal, strategy, tactic—not participation: Can you even imagine participating for no
reason?
ERHARD
You can’t imagine anything for no reason. You really can’t imagine anything for no reason. You
know it sounds like we keep insulting you, like when I told somebody they haven’t lived yet.
Insulting, right? Except everything in the world for you is in-order-to, and nothing is for itself:
that’s not to have lived yet. If everything is in-order-to, you’ve never gotten anything for itself,
you know, the thing itself, as itself. Like another person as that other person; not the other
person in-order-to. It’s a very diff erent context. Remember what we said about “tall” and the
context in which “tall” shows up? Other people in-order-to don’t look like other people as them-
selves. Even a tree in-order-to does not look like a tree as a tree. Love in-order-to is not love, it’s
something else: It’s called love in-order-to. It’s not love. People who only know love in-order-to,
do not know what love is.
In Being and Time, Heidegger has shed light on this
phenomenon, which has gained special significance given
our recent encounter with the most implacable of limits. For
Heidegger, this call reaches Dasein and turns it toward its end,
toward the possibility of its impossibility, the Nothing. Anxiety
then is the correlative attunement in which the call is heard—at
that moment when we find our limit. It is in this attunement that
Being-in-the-world is disclosed as entirely unrecognizable within
any familiar rubric. Thus, the call of conscience cannot be said.
It comes from a strange, unrecognizable domain. The call, when
heard, is uncanny (Unheimlich).
What is the Uncanny?
For Heidegger, uncanniness refers to the human relation to death,
to the possibility of our non-existence, and our tendency to
flee from an authentic confrontation with Being-towards-
the-end. This tendency to flee is not surprising, given “the
everyday publicness of the ‘they,’ which brings tranquillized
self-assurance—‘Being-at-home,’ with all its obviousness—into
the average everydayness of Dasein” (BT 233).
T
In an authentic
confrontation, for instance, here in Session One of Day Four of
The Forum, even “as Dasein falls, anxiety brings it back from its
absorption in the ‘world.’ Everyday familiarity collapses. Dasein
has been individualized, but individualized as Being-in-the-
world” (BT 233). Everything that had heretofore supported the
T
self-understood existence that constituted our self falls away.
There is no “you” there, nor is there an “I”; only Being-in-the-
