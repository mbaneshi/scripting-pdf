KIPP (to Bill)
Chocolate or vanilla: Choose.
BILL (pointing at the hand representing chocolate
(
)
I choose chocolate... because I prefer the fl avor.
KIPP
Perfect. Okay, so, “I chose chocolate because I prefer the fl avor.” That’s a perfect decision,
because what selected the chocolate was what? What did the selecting?
BILL
I did.
KIPP
Well, if you really look at it, the reason, the thought, the consideration—“because I prefer
the flavor better”—came along, right?
BILL
Yeah.
KIPP (pulling a tissue out of a tissue box)
Like this little thought—peep!—comes along...
(dangling the tissue in the air)r
“I prefer the fl avor of chocolate better.”
(pointing at the tissue
(
)
And that reason, that consideration, that thought, selected the chocolate, didn’t it? Not you.
That’s what the selection was based on, wasn’t it?
BILL
Yeah.
KIPP
That’s a decision because it’s based on something. Perfect! That’s what your job is up here, so
everybody can see a decision as a decision, and a choice as a choice. Okay, ready?
(holding out his hands again to Bill)
Chocolate or vanilla: Choose.
