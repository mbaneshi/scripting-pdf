Forum Day Two: Session Three

JODIE
Cheated.
KIPP
That was on the court. You could hear that. Who has to pay for your not having a relationship?
JODIE
Everyone in my life.
KIPP
If you’re not cheated, you don’t know who to be in life. Maybe there is no being authentic.
Maybe the best there is, is being authentic about your own inauthenticity. Being related is much
more risky than being unrelated. You’ve got to be there in the presence of being human.
JODIE
I got it.
KIPP
Don’t be so quick to get it. See, I don’t think you got it. I don’t think you got the dagger in your
heart. What’s your racket an excuse for? You don’t have to reveal yourself. You don’t have to
create a relationship. What persistent condition do you complain about? A cheated person has
to look like a cheated person. You can’t have love in your life or you’d be wrong. What today’s
about is beginning to be in the presence of your own life.
JODIE
I want to get beyond this.
KIPP
There is no getting beyond it. That’s more California. The opportunity is to be with it. Maybe
there is no getting beyond your racket. Maybe the only dignity is in owning it.
The participant, Mike, who earlier in the day had interacted with Erhard about “knowing how to
walk,” raised his hand.
MIKE
I don’t know what my racket is. I’m lost.
(laughter)r
KIPP
What case are you pleading?

SPEAKING BEING
MIKE
I don’t know.
KIPP
Look at your life. What is your life about? What is something that if you could do, you’d do it?
MIKE
I would have everybody like me.
KIPP
But...
MIKE
But if they get to know me, they stop listening to me after ninety seconds.
KIPP
When you are in the presence of another human being, what’s there?
MIKE
I look at the ceiling.
KIPP
Do you feel stupid?
MIKE
Yes.
KIPP
What happened when you were young?
MIKE
I tried to get in with a crowd of kids at school. I tried to blend in. A good friend of mine turned
away and cut me out of the circle.
KIPP
Any others?
MIKE
When I was sweeping. Ten-years-old. My dad said I didn’t sweep well. I wasn’t smart enough to
sweep.
