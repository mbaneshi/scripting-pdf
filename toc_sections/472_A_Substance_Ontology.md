SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
You getting on with every other area except this one is not getting on at all.
(holding out both hands like the vanilla or chocolate choosing exercise)
Marriage, no marriage, choose. Choose!
AVRIL
No marriage.
KIPP
Okay, now what are we going to do? That’s complete.
AVRIL
Yeah, okay. I was great when I had that...
KIPP
What do you mean when you have that? You just chose it!
AVRIL
Right, but then I thought, but somehow, he doesn’t mean, that’s not what they mean by choice,
because that’s what I got two years ago. And I got lit up about it...
KIPP
But then you got sucked right back into it.
AVRIL
Right, and then my husband comes back with, “You’ve got the marriage you’ve got, so stick
with it.” And we’ve been going around and around for two years.
KIPP
The whole question is what are you willing to be responsible for in your life? Isn’t that it? You
don’t quite want to be responsible for it.
(referring to Vinny)
It’s like, he doesn’t want to be responsible for his own power, so he turns everybody else into an
authority fi gure. Nobody wants to be responsible. It doesn’t come with being a human being. So
you have to go on with this crap about your marriage. You’re either going to be married to him or
not. Both of you are going to die, be buried in a box and have dirt thrown on your face. What’s all
the racket about? What being a human being is about is generating sympathy. You’re going to get
everybody sucked into your sympathy. Sympathy is between shit and syphilis in the dictionary.
(laughter)
But that’s what you sound like. Did you ever see puppies born? Kittens?
Forum Day Four: Session Three 459
AVRIL
Yeah.
KIPP
How would you feel about the runt of the litter unable to get to the mother’s milk?
AVRIL
I would feel sad.
KIPP
Well, that’s you. That’s your life.
(making a sound like a puppy whining while trying to break into the litter; laughter erupts)
This will be on your gravestone: “I couldn’t quite fi gure out what to do enough,” right?
AVRIL
Right.
KIPP
Some of you might be listening, “Well, it’s all right to be divorced”; “It’s all right to be married”:
It’s all the same. Simply choose and that leaves you responsible, and what goes along with that.
Now the consequences for what you are doing don’t seem to be nurturing you. Yes?
AVRIL
Right.
KIPP
My litmus test is always: What empowers you? What leaves you empowered?
AVRIL
Thanks.
KIPP
Thank you very much.
(applause)
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 11)
I discovered in this Forum that I decided to get married. I didn’t choose.
KIPP
Something got you married, not you.
460
SPEAKING BEING
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 11)
Exactly. And my wife also saw this. Our marriage was a decision, and not a choice. I am now
the possibility to choose to be married. I am choosing to be married.
KIPP
Which transforms the past. You can choose into the past and transform the past.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 11)
Thank you!
KIPP
Thank you very much.
(applause)
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 12)
I was walking outside and I turned to someone and I said, “Man that ‘problems’ talk was a
bitch. I really had a lot of problems with going unconscious, it was really diffi  cult for me.”
And she said “that’s because you make everything a problem.” And I said “What do you mean
I make everything a problem?” And I saw right there that my response to some issue coming
up, some problem is “this shouldn’t be. I don’t want this. This is crap.” And that’s the way I
would literally be about anything unexpected or that I didn’t want to have happen, when I’m
at home, I don’t want this. And what I saw in the choice distinction that I haven’t somehow
had come together so I could see this: what it is a conversation. That’s all a problem is, is
a conversation. There’s no problem out here. There’s only a conversation. It isn’t anything
else. There’s no problem out here. It is a conversation. And what it means to choose it is to
choose that conversation right there. So that conversation is called “I don’t want to be in that
relationship right now.” Or if it’s a conversation called “My car!” or whatever the conversation
is. I would have that conversation, whatever it was, with myself. And the problem would linger
as a private personal conversation that I kept going on with myself. But I would never choose
the conversation. I wouldn’t choose that private conversation. And what I saw was that in my
relationship, or that in any problem, it’s that moment I choose that conversation right there and
externalize that, get that out here in our relationship, make it public.
KIPP (to the group)
Watch out for listening to this like a formula, or for the seven easy steps for relating. It’s a
distinction he’s sharing.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 12)
Yes. And that’s what there is to choose, not what’s out there but what is right here, and to
communicate what’s right here. All of a sudden I got freedom, I had release, I was awake again.
It wasn’t something I couldn’t do. “Choose that” had always been to me: “submit to it,” or “give
in to it,” or “suppress what you don’t like about it.” That’s what choice was about. Rather than,
“If I’m having a conversation called ‘I don’t like that,’ choose that conversation ‘I don’t like
Forum Day Four: Session Three 461
that.’” And if it’s appropriate you communicate that, and that has the thing moving. And the
other thing I saw about problems is, just like you said, it’s stuck, it’s not moving, and when the
conversation is out here, it’s moving then, and it begins to work its way through whatever’s
stuck.
KIPP (to the group)
What you want to notice here is that even if you don’t quite understand what he is saying, you
can be with him distinguishing something. What’s enlivening is this business of learning and
growing. That’s what’s attractive to you, it’s his life that he’s inquiring into here. The guy’s so
turned on he can barely stand it.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 12)
That’s the last thing I want to say. I’ve been doing this for a long time...
KIPP
That’s why this Forum is special. You’ve got the old timers in this room. You fi nd out what it’s
like to live this stuff  for seventeen years. Doesn’t get less. Not like something you did seventeen
years ago.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 12)
I remember when I read Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind. The biggest pitfall is that you think
you know Zen, is that you “got it.” There was a part of this Forum when I was listening,
“yeah I got that.” And then there was another moment when I saw that I’d had the
conversation fifty times and a lot of people have gotten value out of that, but my life sucks
in that area. I’m so good at working with all these people making a difference, but what
about me and problems?
KIPP
That’s the diff erence between leading The Forum and being The Forum.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 12)
Exactly. And all of a sudden, at that moment, I got all excited about The Forum and the work,
and participating in it again, and learning, and growing and it was all brand-new for me.
KIPP
Thank you.
(applause)
It’s going to take everything you’ve got to be unreasonable with yourself to keep it opened up.
WANDA (whose mother is also a participant in The Forum)
I completed my relationship with my mother, I’m thrilled to say, and I actually didn’t think
that I needed to. But then yesterday when someone was sharing, I just started to cry a lot, and I
didn’t know what she had just said that made me cry.
PARTICIPANT  (Forum leader 12, continuing)
462
SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
She said what she said. You cried. She did not make you cry.
WANDA
All right. What I did notice was I didn’t want her to see me crying. What I saw was two things
my mother said to me as a little girl that had been driving my life. She said that the way to make
her happy was that she’d be happy if I was happy.
KIPP
A lot of you withhold that from your parents. A lot of you don’t want to be well, alive, happy:
You’ve got to keep being a little bit screwed up so that they’re not quite sure they did it all right.
WANDA
The second thing she said about how to make her happy was that whatever I did was that I
would do my best, be the best that I could be. I saw early on that I could not deliver on the fi rst
point, I couldn’t make her happy by me being happy because growing up, my mother was beat
up a lot and I was miserable in that situation. I was telling her this whole thing over dinner
and she didn’t want to hear that part. It was too painful. It brought up that I wasn’t supposed
to share all of the sadness that I had. I was only allowed to share the good things. So I made
that decision that I couldn’t deliver on that promise. I did deliver on the arrangement that I
would be the best I could be at what I chose to be. I went on to gather a lot of credentials and
accomplishments, so that my mother would be happy. I told her that I have been living her
life for her because she also told me when I was little that she had her artwork as a teenager
featured in the Brussels World Fair and I said “Why didn’t you pursue that?” She said, “I went
to career day and went into the room for commercial artists and it was all men.” And the man
leading the event said to her that she had the wrong room. “The typing room is down the hall.”
KIPP
You all got sucked into that one. That’s how much strength you’ve got. One little thing and you
go...
(to laughter, Kipp imitates again a runt trying to break into the litter to feed from)
WANDA
When she had shared that with me, that she didn’t get to pursue her career I made a decision
that I would for her. I’ve been living her life for her. I would carry that torch...
KIPP
It’s not a torch; it’s an anvil around your neck.
WANDA (to laughter)
Right. Right. And then I asked her why she didn’t pursue it later and she said, “Well, I got
married and had sixteen children.”
Forum Day Four: Session Three 463
(laughter)
KIPP (to the group)
Are you starting to see how much room you have in life to be? Every conversation, you’re gone.
You are a Velcro ball.
WANDA
I’m sharing this to see the decisions I’ve made and how they have run me. And what I decided
at that point was to never allow my family to stop me in my career. I was sharing this with her
during dinner and she said, “This is too painful, I don’t want to talk about this.” My point in
sharing this is that without this Forum we wouldn’t have had the breakthrough we did have. At
one point I fi nally said, “Mom, the only way you and I and the rest of the children will be freed
is to talk about it like ‘that’s what’s so,’ rather than to suppress it.”
KIPP
Think back to the conversation we were just having a few minutes ago. In the real-life sense,
these are the conversations he was talking about choosing, like those, the ones that are there to
talk about.
WANDA
So at that point she asked me for some coaching—she’d never asked for that before...
KIPP
You had not been available for that before. It’s not that she never asked you: You’ve never been
there, available.
WANDA
So we started sharing about the experience. She acknowledged that the experience was
painful for her. The first time she had ever acknowledged that and that it might have been
painful for us as children growing up around that. She had not been willing to confront
that with us.
KIPP (correcting her)
She hadn’t said that.
WANDA
Right. Well, I hadn’t been willing to confront it either...
KIPP (correcting again, getting her out of the story into the what happened)
You hadn’t said that...
WANDA
We did share it. It looked like what was coming across was that she didn’t do a good job.
464
SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
It looked like that’s what you were saying?
WANDA
Yeah. I was sitting across the table and I got up and went around and I said “Mom, I want
you to know that all of the accomplishments are a result of the incredible support and love
and training that you gave me in growing up and that anything that has not worked is a
result of my racket, I am the source of all of that. You did a great job. We all turned out.” She
had this great big smile on her face. I said “Being able to talk about this, we may be able to
laugh about it now.” She said, “well, maybe.” We hugged and kissed. We went our separate
ways but then ran into each other in the bathroom. She comes up to me and whispers in my
ear, “Wanda, I want you to know that I am so proud of you, for all your accomplishments,
even though it was kind of hard growing up, wasn’t it?” And she started to laugh. This kind
of communication would never have occurred if it hadn’t been for The Forum. I now have a
relationship with my mother I’ve never had before. And now I can open up with her and even
share the rough times as well as the wonderful times.
KIPP (to the group)
Get these things captured in your conversation. When you’re sharing this week, you will want
to stop, because you’re not used to sharing. But people in your life are worth this conversation.
WANDA
Something else opened up out of this conversation. One of the things I’ve been struggling
with today is my relationship to my manager, looking at some resistance I’ve had and all of
a sudden realizing, as I walked in, this great sense of freedom, I’ve not been willing to let my
manager manage me, to get close enough to me to manage me and coach me. I’ve been afraid
of him discovering all this stuff  underneath what I’m hiding, all the things that I’ve had with
my mom that I’ve carried around with me everywhere. An incredible opening and insight!
KIPP
Thank you!
(applause)
You need to see that you’re going to need that campaign to stamp out reasonableness in your
life, to keep this happening in your life.
TRUMAN
Thank you for calling on me. Yesterday I had decided I wanted to share. And I didn’t get called
on when I had my hand up, and then I was getting pissed off . I said, “Wait a minute. I’m
black...”
(laughter)
“...you’re supposed to call on me now. I’m ready!” I knew I had a black act but didn’t know I
had such a chip on my shoulder. How I go about it is I get close to people and as soon as I get
