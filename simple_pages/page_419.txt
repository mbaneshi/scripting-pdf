Forum Day Four: Session Two 
405
DONALD (sitting)
Okay I’m done.
TIM
The diffi  culty I’m having is to get the baggage away from the problem I carry because of the cul-
ture and my own experiences, because when I hear the word “problem,” whether it “shouldn’t 
be” or “in life there are problems,” there are invitations to certain kinds of action around the
word problem, like “solve it,” or “do something about it.”
WES
Very good. Yeah.
TIM
Or “remedy.”
WES
Sure, we haven’t gotten there yet. “Shouldn’t be”: What is the response to something that
shouldn’t be?
TIM
You get rid of it...
WES
Get rid of it. Do something about it. Solve it. Fix it. Change it. Right?
TIM
Right. Find the solution.
WES
Find the solution. Solve it! See we never notice something. Let me tell you something about this
conversation. We’re doing diff erent dimensions. It isn’t like you have to get everything on the 
same dimension. But you have to get the dimensions to get the conversations. We did this on 
the fi rst day, right? In geometry we learned about three axes.
Wes drew a diagram on the board representing the x, y, and z axes.
WES (continuing)
You know you can’t collapse those. That’s the very nature of them, that they are distinct axes;
they etch out diff erent dimensions. What people try to do to fi gure things out—because fi guring 
out has to have things in a linear fashion—is they try to fi t everything on a single axis. What 
they don’t see is that there’s power in creating in a conversation a group of dimensions, which
when you get them all, you get the picture. You can’t put a sphere on one dimension, can you?
