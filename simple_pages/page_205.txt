Forum Day Three: Session One
191
JANE
Yes.
Erhard stood very close to Jane at this point, his tone intimate. 
ERHARD
Because it’s something you do and something you are that you wish wasn’t so. 
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
What’s the payoff  for hiding? Does hiding make you right that people don’t like you? It makes 
you right about the fact that you’re not something to be liked. 
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
Who does it make wrong?
JANE
Them.
ERHARD
Yeah. Because they don’t like you. And you don’t have to be responsible for relating; don’t have 
to be dominated by relationship. Who you are is, “I’m not in the game.” Right?
JANE
Right.
ERHARD
How does it have you dominate? It keeps people trying to get in, doesn’t it? People around you 
are puppets trying to get in. They’re puppets dangling on the hand of your racket. Right?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Are you physically attractive?
JANE
No. I’m ugly inside. 
through their manner of being makes everything depressing and 
puts a damper on everything” (FCM 67). These attunements are 
“not at all inside in some sort of soul of the Other,” nor are they out 
there at hand in the world in some way (FCM 66). 
Where and in what way are they, then?
“
In positive terms, attunement is a fundamental 
manner, the fundamental way in which Dasein is
as Dasein. . . .  And precisely those attunements to
which we pay no heed at all, the attunements we 
least observe, those attunements that attune us 
in such a way that we feel as though there is no 
attunement there at all, as though we were not 
attuned in any way at all—these attunements are 
the most powerful. (FCM 67–68)
M
In attunements, “we first meet ourselves—as being-there” (FCM
68). They shape our world, give us our ways of being, and provide 
the context for our philosophizing. Heidegger says that the task
of philosophy is to “awaken” them in some sense, and then . . . 
well, we correct the situation, of course. This is the usual human 
impulse: fix the problem by altering or replacing the attunement. 
Heidegger and Erhard, on the other hand, are proposing a 
diff erent response, one distinguished throughout their thinking
and most importantly referred to by Heidegger as appropriation;
appropriation lets the situation be, distinguished as itself. 
“
[A]wakening attunements is a manner and means 
of grasping Da-sein with respect to the specific
‘way’ [Weise] in which it is, of grasping Da-sein as
Da-Sein, or better: of letting Da-sein be as it is, or 
can be, as Da-sein. Such awakening may perhaps 
be a strange undertaking, diff icult and scarcely 
transparent. If we have understood our task, then 
we must now see to it that we do not suddenly 
start to deliberate about attunements again or 
t
even about awakening, but inasmuch as this
t
awakening is an acting, we must act in accordance
t
with it. (FCM 68)
