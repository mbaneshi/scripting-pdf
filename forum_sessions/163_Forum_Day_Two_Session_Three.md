Forum Day Two: Session Three

ERHARD
Horseshit! What do you mean really needed it? That’s all horseshit. They’re probably 10 times as
tough as you are. Probably needed a lot less than you did. But...irrelevant. You think a fi ve-year-
old is sophisticated enough to deal with that kind of logic?
ANGEL
I tried.
ERHARD
Is a fi ve-year-old sophisticated enough to deal with that kind of logic? You know what a fi ve-
year-old girl looks like?
ANGEL
Yeah, I do, I saw home movies over Christmas. I know exactly what I looked like.
ERHARD
A fi ve-year-old girl is pretty...not very worldly, huh? And also very caring, aren’t they?
ANGEL
Yes. But she told me I didn’t care.
ERHARD
Wait. We’re not back at fi ve now. We’re having a discussion up here for a moment and then we’ll
go back to fi ve. But I want you to look at a fi ve-year-old little girl and see that a fi ve-year-old girl
cares very deeply, and is not up to the logic “you don’t care” because if you’d care you would
know that these other children need more love and attention than you do. So you dealt with it
like a fi ve-year-old. What does a fi ve-year-old decide?
ANGEL
She was right.
ERHARD (raising voice)e
No! She decides she’s going to be the most caring person in the whole world!
ANGEL
Yes! Yes! Yes!
ERHARD
Like those magical bullshit fucking things that fi ve-year-old girls do, which is wonderful when
you’re a fi ve-year-old girl. You know, you decide, “I’m going to be the most caring person in the
whole world! No one’s going to care more than me.”

SPEAKING BEING
ANGEL
Right.
ERHARD
You became that like Mike became stupid. It wasn’t something you decided, it wasn’t something
you thought. You became that.
ANGEL
You want to hear something stupid? Being stupid isn’t good but being sensitive and caring is
good.
ERHARD
But listen up. You didn’t quite get what I said. You actually became, gave yourself an identity,
called caring. Whatever caring you had got buried under that identity. You became a caring ma-
chine. You became a caring robot. And whatever authentic caring you had, whatever authentic
feeling you had; that got obscured by the robot. You get what I’m saying? You know what it’s
like to be married to a robot? Not good. This is not a good thing. Being related to a fucking
robot. Particularly when the robot looks like they might be good for something else, like a real
relationship. Did you hear what I just said?
ANGEL
Yes.
ERHARD
That caring act will get you plenty of relatedness, but it will never fulfi ll itself.
ANGEL
Right. That’s why I could get married a million times, but I can’t stay.
ERHARD
Caring is very attractive. The only problem is it’s no fun to do it with a robot. And you’re a fuck-
ing robot. You know, like a doll. Like a caring doll. You push on the button that says “I care.” It’s
a lot of fun for a little while. But after a while it’s got to have some substance. You took a very
good thing and turned it into a mechanism.
(referring to Mike)
You see, he at least took something bad and turned it into a mechanism.
(laughter)r
He had a little better luck than you did. You took something really good and turned it into a
mechanism. So you know, his straightness, his authenticity leaks out around his act. But you
took caring and being, like really being there, and turned it into an act, and it obscures your
authentic caring and authentic feeling.
