SPEAKING BEING
JANE
No.
ERHARD
Would you like to be happy in school?
JANE
Yeah. Well, I feel if I was happier about being in school I’d get better grades.
ERHARD
Okay. You’d also be happier in life.
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
What happened in the fourth grade?
JANE
The biggest thing I remember is I asked people to come to my birthday party, and no one 
showed up for it.
ERHARD
What did you decide when nobody showed up?
JANE
That no one liked me.
ERHARD
I want you to be right there—back in the fourth grade. You didn’t merely decide “nobody likes 
me.” You became “nobody likes me.” You’ve been living over top of “nobody likes me.” And 
when nobody likes you, it’s threatening to stand up in front of a group. Do you get that?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Is it true that nobody likes you?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
How old are you when you’re in the fourth grade?
The scientific mind boggles; but these principles lie at the
heart of a phenomenological approach to knowing, such as those 
of Heidegger and Erhard: you must yourself be fully available for 
the outcome; and the insight of the transformational Augenblick is
that the meaning of my life is determined by the stand I take on it. 
But I must first take a stand.

Attunements are already always there. I am never not attuned
in some way to the world; there is never a naked “I” which sub-
sequently becomes attuned. We are attuned from inception, but
without being conscious of our attunement. This is tricky territory.
“
We speak, aft er all, of the unconscious. In one re-
spect it is at hand, and yet in another respect it is
not at hand, namely insofar as it is not conscious.
This strange ‘at hand and yet at the same time not
at hand’ arises from the possibility of being con-
scious of something unconscious. (FCM 61)

Attunements live in the realm that Werner Erhard calls what we 
don’t know that we don’t know. The Forum functions to unconceal
the “blind spots” that constitute this realm.
“ 
The distinction between not being there [Nicht-
Dasein] in the sense of the unconscious and being
there [Dasein] in the sense of what is conscious
also seems to be equivalent to what we have in 
mind by awakening, specifically by the awakening
of whatever is sleeping.
(FCM 61)
M
Therefore Heidegger begins with a proposal that attunements are
sleeping, and we want them awake so that they can be dealt with, 
and their influence on our world can be perceived. “Awakening 
means to make something wakeful. . . .  To awaken an attunement 
means, aft er all, to let it become awake and as such precisely to let 
it be” (FCM 60).
