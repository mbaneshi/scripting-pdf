Forum Day Four: Session Three 463
(laughter)
KIPP (to the group)
Are you starting to see how much room you have in life to be? Every conversation, you’re gone.
You are a Velcro ball.
WANDA
I’m sharing this to see the decisions I’ve made and how they have run me. And what I decided
at that point was to never allow my family to stop me in my career. I was sharing this with her
during dinner and she said, “This is too painful, I don’t want to talk about this.” My point in
sharing this is that without this Forum we wouldn’t have had the breakthrough we did have. At
one point I fi nally said, “Mom, the only way you and I and the rest of the children will be freed
is to talk about it like ‘that’s what’s so,’ rather than to suppress it.”
KIPP
Think back to the conversation we were just having a few minutes ago. In the real-life sense,
these are the conversations he was talking about choosing, like those, the ones that are there to
talk about.
WANDA
So at that point she asked me for some coaching—she’d never asked for that before...
KIPP
You had not been available for that before. It’s not that she never asked you: You’ve never been
there, available.
WANDA
So we started sharing about the experience. She acknowledged that the experience was
painful for her. The first time she had ever acknowledged that and that it might have been
painful for us as children growing up around that. She had not been willing to confront
that with us.
KIPP (correcting her)
She hadn’t said that.
WANDA
Right. Well, I hadn’t been willing to confront it either...
KIPP (correcting again, getting her out of the story into the what happened)
You hadn’t said that...
WANDA
We did share it. It looked like what was coming across was that she didn’t do a good job.

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
It looked like that’s what you were saying?
WANDA
Yeah. I was sitting across the table and I got up and went around and I said “Mom, I want
you to know that all of the accomplishments are a result of the incredible support and love
and training that you gave me in growing up and that anything that has not worked is a
result of my racket, I am the source of all of that. You did a great job. We all turned out.” She
had this great big smile on her face. I said “Being able to talk about this, we may be able to
laugh about it now.” She said, “well, maybe.” We hugged and kissed. We went our separate
ways but then ran into each other in the bathroom. She comes up to me and whispers in my
ear, “Wanda, I want you to know that I am so proud of you, for all your accomplishments,
even though it was kind of hard growing up, wasn’t it?” And she started to laugh. This kind
of communication would never have occurred if it hadn’t been for The Forum. I now have a
relationship with my mother I’ve never had before. And now I can open up with her and even
share the rough times as well as the wonderful times.
KIPP (to the group)
Get these things captured in your conversation. When you’re sharing this week, you will want
to stop, because you’re not used to sharing. But people in your life are worth this conversation.
WANDA
Something else opened up out of this conversation. One of the things I’ve been struggling
with today is my relationship to my manager, looking at some resistance I’ve had and all of
a sudden realizing, as I walked in, this great sense of freedom, I’ve not been willing to let my
manager manage me, to get close enough to me to manage me and coach me. I’ve been afraid
of him discovering all this stuff  underneath what I’m hiding, all the things that I’ve had with
my mom that I’ve carried around with me everywhere. An incredible opening and insight!
KIPP
Thank you!
(applause)
You need to see that you’re going to need that campaign to stamp out reasonableness in your
life, to keep this happening in your life.
TRUMAN
Thank you for calling on me. Yesterday I had decided I wanted to share. And I didn’t get called
on when I had my hand up, and then I was getting pissed off . I said, “Wait a minute. I’m
black...”
(laughter)
“...you’re supposed to call on me now. I’m ready!” I knew I had a black act but didn’t know I
had such a chip on my shoulder. How I go about it is I get close to people and as soon as I get
