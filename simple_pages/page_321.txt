Forum Day Three: Session Four 
307
ERHARD
Okay, there’s a certain part of The Forum for which you need to be less tired. I didn’t say not 
tired. I said less tired, less tired than you’re going to be if I answer all your questions!
(laughter)
So we’re not going to answer any more questions tonight. Tonight we’re going to...
(after a participant shouted out: “Let’s vote.”)
Does it really make you feel good to vote?
(laughter)
What about “The rug is red? Yeah!”
(laughter)
If you like voting why don’t you vote on stuff  like that? “Yeah! This rug is red! Yeah!”
(clapping with everyone else joining in)
So, we’re not going to keep you up with answering questions, we’re going to keep you up with 
an assignment. Stay up at home. 
KIPP
Between tonight and tomorrow morning your assignment is to get clear that life is empty and 
meaningless. So what you’re going to come up against between tonight and tomorrow morning 
is all those places that you say have...
(the group shouts back: “meaning”)
And you’re going to inquire into those to see that they are...
(the group shouts: “meaningless”)
ERHARD
One other thing is to look at where they’ve made it mean something that life is empty and 
meaningless. Particularly add that in there. 
KIPP
The second part: what you’ve made it mean that life is empty and meaningless. Therefore... 
There is also an invitation: to share what’s been opening up for you with people in your life. Get 
clear that life is empty and meaningless. And what have you made it mean that life is empty 
and meaningless?
The third day of The Forum concluded.
