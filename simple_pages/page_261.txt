Forum Day Three: Session Three 247
JACOB
So is that the perfect spot?
ERHARD
No. That’s adding meaning to it. That’s a Jacobism, that last one. That’s the best one you did 
because you can see it in that one. See, you’re trying to make it all right! That’s what it means to 
turn it into a philosophy. You’re doing a “fi reside talk.” It’s a trap. But it’s all right that it’s a trap.
JACOB
That’s what I’m saying.
ERHARD
But that’s what ruins it. It’s not all right. It’s not not all right either. It’s just like this.
JACOB
Okay.
ERHARD
You got it. Well done, thank you. 
(applause)
KIPP
Patsy, you win the prize, and a large bicep. Holding your hand up for forty minutes straight.
PATSY
Aerobics!
KIPP
Exactly.
PATSY
It’s taken me three days to get up and talk, and I love to talk...
KIPP
When should you have gotten up to talk?
PATSY
I said something the fi rst day...
KIPP
You said it took you three days to get up.
