ERHARD
Sure because you’re an accomplished person.
LUCY
I am trying to avoid something, that feeling that something is wrong. But the next question that 
comes to mind is what is the strategy to fi x that? And you said you don’t fi x it.
ERHARD
No you don’t.
LUCY
But I don’t agree with that. 
ERHARD
It’s not that you don’t agree with that. You are addicted to fi xing it. 
LUCY
That’s true.
ERHARD
You have to have an answer. 
LUCY
Not an answer, but to fi nd a way to fi x it, and then fi x it.
ERHARD
Yeah. You and Suzanne ought to get together. These are two achievement nuts. You can’t fi x it. 
LUCY
Why not?
ERHARD
Well, you tell me how to fi x being dead and I’ll tell you how to fi x it.
LUCY
Well a lot of things are one’s frame of mind and how you think things...
ERHARD
That’s not true. A lot of things are explained using the terminology of the frame through which 
you look at things. Like positive thinking. Good stuff . What kind of a person would need to 
think positively? 
LUCY
Somebody who’s kind of negative.
