Forum Day Two: Session One
93
(referring to Sienna)
What she said, I felt I could identify with and so I felt that I had nothing to contribute. But for
me to really get something out of being here, I really need to say it out loud. I seem to have the
answer for myself and everyone, and I’m so busy looking good that I’m not getting my..., that
having all the answers has killed off  the possibility in my life.
WES
Like maybe you’ve killed your life.
PHOEBE
Yeah, that I’m so smart and that I’ve got it so fi gured out, that I have the answer and no possi-
bility. And I noticed when we did our homework, last night and this morning, that all that kept
coming up was lots of answers and no new stuff , which is what I think I got out of yesterday,
the possibilities of what my life could be about. That’s what I don’t have is possibility in my life.
WES
Got it. Great. Thanks.
(another participant stands)
ROSS
I’ve been waiting for the right time to get up here and say something profound and so this is the
right time, but it isn’t anything profound.
WES
The wrong time is when it is profound, so you don’t have to worry about it. How many are wait-
ing for something signifi cant, profound, before you’re going to get up to share?
(many raising their hands)
We don’t want your crummy shares! If you really listen you’ll fi nd that the most powerful shares
are some of the simplest and dealing with the most ordinary aspects of our life. From the power
and insight of The Forum to shed light on the ordinary aspects of our life, you’ll fi nd some of
the most powerful things you’ve listened to. Thanks for acknowledging that.
ROSS
What happened for me yesterday and last night and I’m convinced, also while I was sleeping,
was just the continuous looking again at all the beliefs, a lot of the things that I’ve been work-
ing on in this area, and opening up diff erent possibilities for it, and starting really, one of the
reasons why I came to The Forum was that I wanted to take a look at what the barriers were for
my success. I’ve been successful in the past, I’ve been able to create the things that I’ve wanted,
and then they slipped away, for whatever reason, and I really want to take a look at what those
barriers were and what’s been happening. All yesterday and last night, and this morning is, let’s
take a look at the distinctions. They’re really starting to separate. I fi nd that I spend a lot of time
and energy in the story, and very little time dealing with what’s happening.
as well as the Interval “Dasein: Meaning and Mineness” at the end
of Session Two, Day One). A dog can be a dog only for a human
being; only for a human can a sunset be beautiful. But also among
the entities freed by Dasein to be in the world are other human
beings—entities which are “like the very Dasein which frees them,
in that they are there too, and there with it” (BT 154).
T
These terms—with and too—are to be understood existential-
ly. That is, Being-there-too does not mean merely that the Others
are present-at-hand in the world, available to be encountered.
Heidegger is not describing a situation in which beings are located
alongside each other in world space; rather he is distinguishing
integral elements of the beings themselves. Withness is a part of
Dasein’s Being—my own Dasein, and the Dasein of Others. The
“too,” says Heidegger, means a “sameness of Being” (BT 154).
T
Heidegger makes precise use of hyphenation in languaging
the ontological world-structure he is proposing. Early on in Being
and Time, he specifies that Things—substances, equipment,
objects of nature—are within the world, a location-relationship
that he indicates by the absence of hyphenation (BT 91). Here, he
T
posits a further specification:
“
Thus Dasein’s world frees entities which are
not only quite distinct from equipment and
Things, but which also—in accordance with
their kind of being as Dasein themselves—are
‘in’ the world in which they are at the same
time encountered within-the-world, and are
‘in’ it by way of Being-in-the-world. . . . So if
one would want to identify the world in gen-
eral with entities within-the-world, one would
have to say that Dasein too is ‘world.’ (BT 154)
T
So because Dasein—mine and the Others’—are in-the-world exis-
tentially, we can be encountered “in” the world environmentally.
Once again, we call attention to the deeply reflexive nature
of Heidegger’s ontological distinctions. His languaging repeatedly
turns thinking back upon itself, since his goal is to have us bend
back to see ourselves from a new perspective.
94
SPEAKING BEING
WES
Yeah.
ROSS
And in the short time that I’ve been doing this, I’ve already noticed some openness come into
the picture.
WES
Yeah, what if you lived your life totally in a story? Just consider that as a possibility. Now I
know you can always fi nd exceptions, but you know the exception only shows the rule. So don’t
look at the exceptions. Stand in the possibility that your whole life is a story. And as you get
the distinction “story versus what happened,” you might notice that life is passing by, and that
you’re in a story about life. You’re not in life.
ROSS
There were lots of things that I took a look at last night and the major thing that I’d like to share
with you is integrity... is probably one of my major inauthenticities, at least there’s a possibility
for that. And I’m real quick to pick it up in somebody else. Actually as a result of yesterday I’ve
been able to look at some of the possibilities where I am not in integrity. I did an exercise with
my daytimer, and I realized that all the things that are really important to me just didn’t get
done. And so there’s one major commitment not kept, which I really felt to be important to me
having accomplished.
WES
Great. Thank you.
MARSHA
Last night when I went home, I guess things were starting to get uncovered because I was so
angry. My normal thing is to be the cheerleader and get up in the morning and get things done
and extend myself so far wide that there’s nothing left for me. It is starting to wear on me physi-
cally, and what I got last night was that I am so angry, so angry: at me. It came across at fi rst last
night, being so angry at Werner. I did the training 15 years ago, but if I saw Werner out in the
parking lot last night I would have run him over. I was so angry. I chewed off  my sister-in-law’s
head last night. It has never been expressed like this before, because it has been so important
to me to express, to get across, “you don’t like me and I’m going to make you like me,” and that
has taken a tremendous amount of energy, and what is underneath that is just a lot of anger.
WES
And anything underneath that?
MARSHA
I don’t know yet. I’m just really into the anger now.
In Heidegger’s account of Being-with, we find “world” per-
vaded by relatedness. The presence of Others is embedded in all
of our everyday activities. When we are at work on a project, the
Others for whom the project is being performed are encountered
in the work. If we walk along the edge of a field, the field “shows
itself as belonging to such and such a person.” If I am at leisure,
the book I am reading “was bought at So-and-so’s shop and given
by such-and-such a person, and so forth” (BT 154).
T
Heidegger is not making the obvious point that the book
belongs to someone, but is emphasizing the degree to which the
presence of my relatedness to Others imbues my existence. Others
whom I encounter in these objects and activities are a part of my
world and in the same way I am a part of theirs.
“
By reason of this with-like Being-in-the-world,
the world is always the one that I share with
Others. The world of Dasein is a with-world.
Being-in is Being-with Others. Their Being-
in-themselves within-the-world is Dasein-with.
(BT 155)
clearing for me. Others make it possible for me to Be, a situation
that persists even when no Other is present.
“
Even Dasein’s Being-alone is Being-with in the
world. The Other can be missing only in and for
a Being-with. Being-alone is a deficient mode of
Being-with; its very possibility is the proof of
this. (BT 156–157)
T
Thus Heidegger has distinguished in withness an extraordi-
nary existential possibility for human relatedness, a possibility
which we see as an essential element of The Forum transforma-
tion. Here he specifies another aspect of this connection:
“
Being-with is such that the disclosedness of
the Dasein-with of Others belongs to it; this
means that because Dasein’s Being is Being-
with, its understanding of Being already
Forum Day Two: Session One
95
WES
You’re present to your anger.
MARSHA
I’m very present to my anger. And I am not a nice person. I’m really getting that I’m, a couple peo-
ple looked around here and “oh boy, what a bitch she is.” And I’m saying, I am the biggest fl aming
bitch. And I’ve covered that up for a long time.
WES (to the group)
Consider the possibility that you are a “covering-up.” I did not say you have a covering-up. I said
consider the possibility that you are a covering-up. See, when she deals with herself, deals with
the covering up; cheerleader on top of angry woman, but that’s who she is.
At this point (10:30 am) Erhard appeared at the back of the room, and spoke in response to the
conversation about covering up. His attire remained the same throughout The Forum: today the
sweater-vest was olive-green, the slacks brown.
ERHARD
The way it works operationally is—it’s something you’re afraid you might be—is angry. There’s
always a something happened—always, always. However it is that you are, there’s always a
“something happened” that caused that. And almost nobody knows that because they come at
the way they are from the conceptual side, from the descriptive side, from the explanatory side.
When you get to the source of the way you are, there’s always a “something happened.” You put
yourself together, fashioned yourself as you were growing up. We pay attention, particular atten-
tion to various aspects of what we call our selves, or what we might call, more accurately, your
identity at various eras of our growing up. In a certain era of your growing up, you were building
a certain part of your identity. And at another era you built another part of your identity. And
then sometimes you go back and put the fi nishing touches on something you built earlier. But I
want you to begin to be able to think that people are manufactured. You and I are constructed.
Whatever it is that you’re referring to when you say “I think,” whatever the “I” refers to, you call
that your self, or your identity—sometimes you’ll call it your personality. But whatever is being
referred to when you say “I think,” “I feel,” “I believe”; and it gets put together out of “what hap-
peneds”; and there’s a “what happened” for every piece of you. A lot of who you are, of how you
got to be the way you are, and a lot of what maintains your identity is a product of what you’re
afraid you might be. Something happened in Marsha’s life, and she decided it was wrong to be
angry, or she shouldn’t be angry, or only bad people are angry, or something like that.
(Marsha is weeping; Erhard addresses another participant)
Don’t help her. Thanks.
(continuing)
And she decided that was wrong or bad or something she shouldn’t be, and then she got to be
afraid that she might be that, and so she had to keep that down in the swamp, at the bottom of
the Valley of the Shadow of Death, and it’s been there for years, and it runs her life: what she’s
afraid she might be. See I don’t even know that she is angry. I don’t know that the truth about
implies the understanding of Others. This un-
derstanding, like any understanding, is not an
acquaintance derived from knowledge about
them, but a primordially existential kind of
Being, which, more than anything else, makes
such knowledge and acquaintance possible.
(BT 160–161)
Of course, says Heidegger, the factical development of my
relatedness with another human being will always depend upon
how well I have come to know myself. And here he makes a point
that is significant for our understanding of The Forum dynamic:
self-knowledge, he says, arises from relatedness to Others:
“
Of course it is indisputable that a lively mutual
acquaintanceship on the basis of Being-with,
oft en depends upon how far one’s own Dasein
has understood itself at the time; but this
means that it depends only upon how far one’s
essential Being with Others has made itself
transparent and has not disguised itself. And
that is possible only if Dasein, as Being-in-the-
world, already is with Others. (BT 162)
We propose that the transformation that occurs for participants
in The Forum is not an individual experience, but that the
self-knowledge it makes available arises mutually with an under-
standing of others.
This is the function of The Forum’s dialogic structure, in which
even participants who do not participate overtly in the conversa-
tion are able to find themselves in the sharing of others. Forum par-
ticipants are repeatedly exhorted to listen to others’ sharing “like
that’s you in some way speaking.” As the sharing continues, The
Forum leader persistently deconstructs each participant’s story
about his or her experience, and frames the experience instead in
the language of the distinctions being developed. The distinctions
gradually reveal the ontological structures underlying the expe-
riences, structures common to all of the experiences despite the
diff erences in their details.
96
SPEAKING BEING
Marsha is that she’s an angry person. I know that’s what’s running her life. Once she’s able to be
with being angry, once she’s able to give being to being angry, she might fi nd out she’s not angry
g
at all. But “not being angry” is going to run her life until she’s able to be angry. I know you don’t
get all that yet. You’re starting to get it. As you go along today you will get it. Before you get out
of here, you will get at the source of your identity. What happens if you get at the source of your
identity, somebody with a yellow name tag?
Participant (who is wearing a yellow name tag, i.e. someone doing The Forum for the fi rst time)
It doesn’t own you anymore.
ERHARD
Yeah. It’s that simple. This is something almost nobody knows. You’re now one of the few people in
the world that knows this. What everybody else in the world knows is that you’ve got to fi x what’s
wrong with you, you’ve got to avoid what’s bad, in you or in life. What you now know is any time
you get at the source of something, you are no longer limited to it. Most people would be afraid to do
what Marsha has done. They fi nd anger so abhorrent, that they are afraid they might fi nd out that
they are angry. And they can’t tolerate that, they can’t be with that, and so they never get to the being
angry like that’s a possible way of being; they fi ght against being angry, they reject it. In the 70s you
were supposed to let it all hang out. That’s indulging anger, that doesn’t work either. When you felt
angry you were supposed to spray it all over the place on people. That’s indulging the anger. That’s as
much bullshit as suppressing the anger. There’s a thing called responsibility. As I told you yesterday
you don’t know what that means yet, but we’ll get to it before we’re done here. Something close to
owning something, being able to be with it. So you want to take a look down in the swamp down
there at what you’re afraid you might be or hoped you weren’t, or don’t want to be. That’s where the
monsters are. The green slimy monsters of what you’re afraid to be are running your life. Most of us
would be afraid to get at it, because we’re afraid we might be
t
it. When you own that, at its source, it
e
no longer owns you. We’re afraid to get at it for fear that we might be it. What you’re afraid of owns
you. Marsha, what did you notice in there?
MARSHA
I notice that I’m angry at everybody and everything in this world.
Erhard (to the group)
You want to get the courage in that. She’s angry waiting to happen: already always angry. It’s all
over the place. It colors the clearing in which the world occurs for her. And only to the degree
she is willing to be with that, standing in front of 800 people and starting to communicate it,
you’re starting to be with it. That’s a lot diff erent than hoping you’re not that. You were saying?
MARSHA
There isn’t one person in this world that I’m not angry with.
ERHARD
And that’s sad for you.
Through this process, as people in the room hear their own
concerns repeatedly expressed in the speaking of others, not only
do they gain a new way of understanding their own situation, but
at the same time, through the mutuality implicit in the Forum’s
dialogic structure, the withness of Being-with-Others is gradually
brought to presence. The dialogue of The Forum thus unconceals
the possibility of a profound relationship of Being among human
beings. This relatedness, we propose, is at a deeper and more fun-
damental level than the diff erences—of race, ethnicity, religion, or
politics—that occur for us as persistent barriers to cooperation in
all aspects of our lives. Erhard’s work, and its expanding manifes-
tation in the current programs of Landmark Worldwide, create the
possibility for transcending those barriers. ■
ERHARD (continuing)
“
So you want to take a look down in the swamp
down there at what you’re afraid you might
be or hoped you weren’t, or don’t want to
be. That’s where the monsters are. The green
slimy monsters of what you’re afraid to be are
running your life. Most of us would be afraid to
get at it, because we’re afraid we might be it.
When you own that, at its source, it no longer
owns you.
Forum Day Two: Session One
97
MARSHA
Yeah, because I want relationships with people, and I can’t get close.
ERHARD
Listen up here, because most of you are not going to have the courage for this. So you need
to get it from those who do have the courage. That there’s something sad for her about being
angry—that’s why she’s afraid she might be angry, then it’s all mashed in with being close.
Convoluted in a knot.
MARSHA
My whole life has been an act about being happy and cheerful, giving and caring, getting every-
body to like me, and they do. The truth is that I don’t have an enemy in the world.
ERHARD
Hold on for a second. So if you’re a person who has the skills that Marsha has, the skills of be-
ing related to people well, and somehow that’s not nurturing her deeply and profoundly; that’s
not leaving her full of joy, because it’s there in order for her not to be angry! Do you hear the
in-order-to? In order not to be angry?
Marsha remained standing while Erhard worked with several other participants.
ERHARD
So if I’m nice in order not to be angry, what persists? You’ve got to get clear on this. Who’s not
clear on this?
A participant named Mike stood.
ERHARD
So Mike, if I relate well, in order not to be angry, when I relate well, what’s always there is being
angry. It’s being there as something I’m resisting.
Erhard approached another participant, and did a demonstration in which each man grasped the
other’s hands and attempted to push the other away.
ERHARD
So if I’m resisting something, I’m attached to what I’m resisting. All this relating-well dances
around anger, is attached to anger. I never have any profound sense of being related, because
what persists under being related is being angry all the time. I don’t have a deep sense of fulfi ll-
ment out of relating well, because what persists is being angry all the time. See, I’m not related
well in order to be related, I’m related well in order not to be angry. You ever notice that real
nice people, when you crack their shell a little bit, there’s a lot of dissatisfaction and sadness?
You know, there’s a lot of real nice people in here; all you got to do is crack the surface and then
there’s dissatisfaction. Is it starting to be clear?
98
SPEAKING BEING
MIKE
Just a bit. I see you pushing against this gentleman over here, and I’m understanding something
about anger. You’re saying, pushing it away, it’s still there. Kind of fuzzy.
ERHARD
When I push him away, am I not attached to him?
MIKE
You’re touching him yes.
ERHARD
No, attached to him. I can’t get away from him as I’m pushing him away, can I?
MIKE
No you can’t.
ERHARD
So in a sense I’m attached to him, am I not?
MIKE
And you’re doing the attaching.
ERHARD
Never mind who is doing the attaching.
Erhard returned to the other participant and had him hold Erhard’s shoulders.
ERHARD
So, he’s got me now, right? And I can’t get away. He’s holding on to me, right?
MIKE
Right.
ERHARD
What’s the diff erence between that and this?
Erhard pushed the participant as he did in the previous instance.
ERHARD
In terms of being attached? Whether John is holding on to me, or I’m pushing him away, we are
r
equally attached.
MIKE
Okay.
Forum Day Two: Session One
99
ERHARD
So, whatever it is you’re resisting, it’s exactly the same in its end result as what it is you’re
indulging. If I’m addicted to anger, I’m no more or less attached to anger than if I was resisting
anger. Clear about that part?
MIKE
I am clear about that part.
ERHARD
Good. Let’s go to the next part. By virtue of not being angry... You see, what being eff ective at re-
lating is about for Marsha, it’s about not being angry. So what’s the result of relating eff ectively?
MIKE
I’m lost.
ERHARD
You’re not lost. You’re intelligent. You’re clear that you don’t understand what I’m saying. Say-
ing you understand when you don’t is “lost.” Clear?
t
MIKE
I want to say yes, but... go ahead.
ERHARD
Is it clear that you aren’t lost?
MIKE
It’s clear that I don’t know what you are talking about right now.
ERHARD
Yeah. That’s pretty clear isn’t it? So you’re not lost. You’re clear.
MIKE
I got that.
ERHARD
Good. Now we’re going back to this business about “if I relate well in order to avoid anger,”
what is the result of my relating well?
MIKE
I’m avoiding the anger.
ERHARD
Perfect. Is there any satisfaction in that? Is that going to leave you whole?
100
SPEAKING BEING
MIKE
It’ll delay confronting the anger.
ERHARD
It might do that but that’s not my point. My point is that being well related with somebody
ought to be a source of fulfi llment and satisfaction, yes?
MIKE
That’s a presupposition.
ERHARD
Yeah: A fairly safe one. If you and I are well related, there ought to be a sense of being fulfi lled
by that.
MIKE
Okay.
ERHARD
But if you and I are well related in order to avoid being angry, the result of being well related
is not satisfaction and fulfi llment: it is avoiding being angry. So you can be well related all over
the place and it’s not going to leave you full of joy or profoundly satisfi ed. It’s going to leave you
having avoided anger. You won and they gave you the booby prize. Is that clearer?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
There are accomplished people who are not nurtured by their accomplishments, because they
are accomplished in order to not be something they’re avoiding being.
(to Mike)
Do you get that?
MIKE
Partially.
ERHARD
Okay, let’s get it completely clear.
MIKE
Okay.
“
But if you and I are well related in order to
avoid being angry, the result of being well
related is not satisfaction and fulfillment: it is
avoiding being angry.
Forum Day Two: Session One
101
ERHARD
This is a room full of highly accomplished people. And you know accomplished people?
MIKE
Sure.
ERHARD
And they are not necessarily profoundly satisfi ed, are they?
MIKE
No they’re not.
ERHARD
And they’re not full of joy.
MIKE
No they’re not.
ERHARD
There’s something wrong there. When people see that, like you and me, we start to come up
with these stupid conclusions. “Well, life isn’t worth it after all. You get all this stuff  done and
so what?” “Is that all there is? I got to be the president of the company,” or “I raised a wonderful
family. Success is shit. Do what you want.” People give up accomplishment: all these weird solu-
tions. Accomplishment doesn’t work for people because they do it in order not to be something.
Clear?
MIKE
I get the theory.
ERHARD
Once you get what you call the theory, you want to stand in that theory and look at life. People
who get married in order to not be lonely, even when they are successful in the marriage, sim-
ply end up being not lonely, while still being attached to “lonely.” This whole big possibility of
being married or being related, they’re not there. They’re in “lonely.” Clear?
MIKE
That part is clear.
ERHARD
Which part isn’t clear?
MIKE
I’m just trying to digest everything.
NOTE: This is a “hint” toward the conversation near the end
of Day Three called “There’s something wrong here.”

خود عناصر انتگرال موجودات. تحمل بخشی از
Dasein وجود دارد - Dasein خود من ، و Dasein دیگران. در
هایدگر می گوید: "بیش از حد" ، به معنای "یکنواختی بودن" است (BT 154). حرف
هایدگر استفاده دقیق از Hyphenation در زبان زدن را انجام می دهد
ساختار جهانی هستی شناختی او را پیشنهاد می کند. در اوایل بودن
و زمان ، او مشخص می کند که چیزها - سامره ها ، تجهیزات ،
اشیاء طبیعت-در جهان هستند ، یک رابطه مکان
که او با عدم وجود هیفن شدن (BT 91) نشان می دهد. اینجا ، او
حرف
مشخصات دیگری را ارائه می دهد:
"
بنابراین جهان دسین موجوداتی را آزاد می کند
نه تنها کاملاً متمایز از تجهیزات و
چیزها ، اما مطابق با
نوع بودن آنها به عنوان خود داسین است -
"در" دنیایی که در آن قرار دارند
زمان با درون جهان روبرو می شوند و هستند
"در آن" از طریق جهان بودن. بشر بشر بشر بنابراین اگر
کسی می خواهد جهان را در ژنرال شناسایی کند
eral با موجودات درون جهان ،
باید بگوییم که Dasein نیز جهان است. (BT 154)
حرف
بنابراین به دلیل اینکه داسین-مین و دیگران-در جهان هستند
به طور کلی ، ما می توانیم از نظر محیط زیست "در" جهان روبرو شویم. یک بار دیگر ، ما به طبیعت عمیقاً بازتابی توجه می کنیم
از تمایزهای هستی شناختی هایدگر. زبان او به طور مکرر
فکر کردن به خود را به عقب برگرداند ، زیرا هدف او این است که ما را خم کنیم
بازگشت به خودمان از دیدگاه جدید. 94

وهمی
بله راس
و در مدت کوتاهی که من این کار را انجام داده ام ، قبلاً متوجه شده ام
تصویر وهمی
بله ، اگر زندگی خود را کاملاً در یک داستان زندگی کنید ، چه می کنید؟ فقط این را به عنوان یک امکان در نظر بگیرید. حالا من
بدانید که همیشه می توانید استثنائات را از بین ببرید ، اما می دانید که استثنا فقط این قانون را نشان می دهد. پس
به استثنائات نگاه کنید. در این احتمال بایستید که کل زندگی شما یک داستان باشد. و همانطور که می گیرید
تمایز "داستان در مقابل آنچه اتفاق افتاده است" ، ممکن است متوجه شوید که زندگی در حال گذر است ، و آن
شما در داستانی درباره زندگی هستید. شما در زندگی نیستید. راس
چیزهای زیادی وجود داشت که من دیشب به آن نگاه کردم و چیز اصلی که می خواهم به اشتراک بگذارم
با شما یکپارچگی است ... احتمالاً یکی از عدم اعتماد به نفس من است ، حداقل یک امکان وجود دارد
برای آن و من واقعاً سریع آن را در شخص دیگری انتخاب می کنم. در واقع در نتیجه دیروز من
توانسته ام به برخی از امکاناتی که من در یکپارچگی نیستم ، نگاه کنم. من یک تمرین با
Daytimer من ، و من فهمیدم که تمام چیزهایی که برای من واقعاً مهم هستند فقط دریافت نکردند
انجام شده و بنابراین یک تعهد بزرگ وجود ندارد ، که من واقعاً احساس کردم برای من مهم است
انجام وهمی
عالی ممنون مارشا
دیشب که به خانه رفتم ، حدس می زنم همه چیز شروع به کشف شد زیرا من چنین بودم
عصبانی. چیز عادی من این است که تشویق کننده باشم و صبح برخیزم و کارها را انجام دهم
و خودم را آنقدر گسترده گسترش دهم که چیزی برای من باقی نمانده است. این شروع به پوشیدن من فیزیکی
کالی ، و آنچه من دیشب کردم این بود که من خیلی عصبانی هستم ، خیلی عصبانی: به من. آخرین بار در اولین بار به دست آمد
شب ، از ورنر خیلی عصبانی است. من 15 سال پیش این آموزش را انجام دادم ، اما اگر ورنر را در آن دیدم
دیشب پارکینگ او را فرار می کردم. خیلی عصبانی شدم من خواهرزاده ام را جوید
شب گذشته سر. قبلاً هرگز اینگونه بیان نشده است ، زیرا بسیار مهم بوده است
برای من بیان ، "شما مرا دوست ندارید و من می خواهم شما را مانند من بسازم" و آن
انرژی فوق العاده ای را به خود اختصاص داده است ، و آنچه در زیر آن قرار دارد فقط عصبانیت زیادی دارد. وهمی
و چیزی در زیر آن؟ مارشا
من هنوز نمی دانم من الان واقعاً عصبانی هستم. در گزارش هایدگر از بودن ، ما "جهان" را پیدا می کنیم
توسط ارتباط با ارتباط. حضور دیگران در کل تعبیه شده است
از فعالیت های روزمره ما وقتی ما در حال کار در یک پروژه هستیم ،
دیگران که این پروژه در حال انجام است با آنها روبرو می شوند
در کار اگر در امتداد لبه یک میدان قدم بزنیم ، این زمینه "نشان می دهد
خود به عنوان متعلق به چنین و چنین شخصی است. " اگر من در اوقات فراغت هستم ،
کتابی که من می خوانم "در فروشگاه So-and-So خریداری شد و داده شد
توسط چنین و چنین شخصی ، و غیره "(Bt 154). t
هایدگر نکته آشکار کتاب را بیان نمی کند
متعلق به کسی است ، اما بر میزان تا چه اندازه تأکید می کند
حضور ارتباط من با دیگران وجود من را تحریک می کند. دیگران
که در این اشیاء و فعالیت ها با آنها روبرو می شوم بخشی از من است
جهان و به همین ترتیب من بخشی از آنها هستم. "
به دلیل این موجود در جهان ، در جهان ،
جهان همیشه همان چیزی است که من با آن به اشتراک می گذارم
دیگران. دنیای داسین یک جهان است. بودن با دیگران است. وجود آنها-
در درون خود در جهان ، dasein-with است. (BT 155)
پاکسازی برای من دیگران این امکان را برای من فراهم می کنند ، یک موقعیت
این حتی اگر هیچ کس دیگری حضور نداشته باشد ، ادامه می یابد. "
حتی حضور داسین در
جهان دیگری را می توان فقط در و برای
یک موجود با حضور در یک حالت کمبود است
بودن با احتمال بسیار آن اثبات است
این (BT 156-157)
حرف
بنابراین هایدگر در یک فوق العاده متمایز شده است-
امکان وجودی برای ارتباط انسان ، یک امکان
که ما به عنوان یک عنصر اساسی در انجمن تبدیل می کنیم-
tion در اینجا او جنبه دیگری از این ارتباط را مشخص می کند:
"
بودن با آن به گونه ای است که فاش شده
dasein-with دیگران متعلق به آن است. این
این بدان معنی است که به دلیل وجود دسین است-
با ، درک آن از بودن در حال حاضر
روز اول انجمن: جلسه یک

وهمی
شما به عصبانیت خود حضور دارید. مارشا
من خیلی با عصبانیت حضور دارم. و من آدم خوبی نیستم. من واقعاً در حال دریافت این هستم ، یک زن و شوهر
پل به اینجا نگاه کرد و "اوه پسر ، او چه عوضی است." و من می گویم ، من بزرگترین fl aming هستم
عوضی و من مدتهاست که آن را پوشانده ام. وس (به گروه)
این احتمال را در نظر بگیرید که "پوشش" هستید. من نگفتم که شما یک پوشش دارید. من گفتم
این احتمال را در نظر بگیرید که شما یک پوشش هستید. ببینید ، وقتی او با خودش سر و کار دارد ، با
پوشش تشویق کننده بالای زن عصبانی ، اما این او کیست. در این مرحله (10:30 صبح) ارهارد در پشت اتاق ظاهر شد و در پاسخ به
مکالمه در مورد پوشش دادن. لباس او در طول انجمن یکسان بود: امروز
ژاکت-زیتون-سبز ، Slacks Brown بود. درز
روشی که از نظر عملیاتی کار می کند این است - این چیزی است که شما می ترسید ممکن است باشید - عصبانی است. وجود دارد
همیشه اتفاقی افتاده است - همیشه ، همیشه. با این حال این است که شما هستید ، همیشه وجود دارد
"اتفاقی افتاد" که باعث آن شد. و تقریباً هیچ کس این را نمی داند زیرا آنها وارد می شوند
روشی که آنها از طرف مفهومی ، از طرف توصیفی ، از طرف توضیحی هستند. وقتی به منبع راه خود می روید ، همیشه "اتفاقی افتاده است". شما قرار دادید
خودتان با هم ، خود را در حال بزرگ شدن مد کرد. ما توجه می کنیم ، خاص
به جنبه های مختلف آنچه ما خودمان می نامیم ، یا آنچه ممکن است با دقت تر آن را صدا کنیم
هویت در دوره های مختلف رشد ما. در دوره خاصی از رشد خود ، شما در حال ساخت هستید
بخش خاصی از هویت شما. و در دوره دیگری بخش دیگری از هویت خود را ساختید. وت
سپس گاهی اوقات به عقب برگردید و لمس های مورد نظر خود را بر روی چیزی که قبلاً ساخته اید قرار دهید. اما من
می خواهم که بتوانید فکر کنید که مردم تولید می شوند. من و شما ساخته شده ایم. هرچه باشد که وقتی می گویید "من فکر می کنم" به آن اشاره می کنید ، هر آنچه که "من" به آن اشاره می کنید ، تماس می گیرید
که خود یا هویت خود - گاهی اوقات آن را شخصیت خود می نامید. اما هر چه باشد
وقتی می گویید "من فکر می کنم" ، "احساس می کنم" ، "من اعتقاد دارم" ؛ و از "آنچه HAP- کنار هم قرار می گیرد
Peneds "؛ و" آنچه اتفاق افتاده "برای هر قطعه از شما وجود دارد. بسیاری از کسانی که شما هستید ، از نحوه شما
باید به روشی که هستید باشید ، و بسیاری از آنچه هویت شما را حفظ می کند ، محصول آنچه شما هستید
می ترسید که باشید. اتفاقی در زندگی مارشا افتاد ، و او تصمیم گرفت که این اشتباه باشد
عصبانی ، یا او نباید عصبانی باشد ، یا فقط افراد بد عصبانی هستند ، یا چیزی شبیه به آن. (مارشا گریه می کند ؛ erhard به یک شرکت کننده دیگر خطاب می کند)
به او کمک نکنید. ممنون (ادامه)
و او تصمیم گرفت که این اشتباه یا بد است یا چیزی که نباید باشد ، و پس از آن او قرار گرفت
می ترسید که او ممکن است چنین باشد ، و به همین ترتیب او مجبور شد آن را در باتلاق ، در انتهای آن نگه دارد
دره سایه مرگ ، و سالها در آنجا بوده است ، و زندگی او را اجرا می کند: او چه چیزی است
می ترسد او باشد. ببینید من حتی نمی دانم که او عصبانی است. من نمی دانم که حقیقت در مورد
دلالت بر درک دیگران دارد. این
درک ، مانند هر درک ، یک نیست
آشنایی حاصل از دانش در مورد
آنها ، اما یک نوع اولیه وجودی
بودن ، که بیش از هر چیز دیگری ایجاد می کند
چنین دانش و آشنایی ممکن است. (BT 160-161)
البته ، هایدگر ، توسعه واقعی من می گوید
ارتباط با یک انسان دیگر همیشه به آن بستگی دارد
چقدر خوبم که خودم را می شناسم. و در اینجا او یک نکته را بیان می کند
این برای درک ما از انجمن پویا قابل توجه است:
به گفته وی ، خودشناسی از ارتباط با دیگران ناشی می شود:
"
البته غیرقابل انکار است که یک متقابل سرزنده
آشنایی بر اساس بودن با بودن ،
از این رو به این بستگی دارد
خود را در آن زمان درک کرده است. اما این
یعنی این فقط به چقدر فرد بستگی دارد
وجود ضروری با دیگران خود را ساخته است
شفاف و خود را مبدل نکرده است. وت
این تنها در صورتی ممکن است که Dasein باشد.
جهان ، در حال حاضر با دیگران است. (bt 162)
ما پیشنهاد می کنیم که تحولی که برای شرکت کنندگان رخ می دهد
در انجمن یک تجربه فردی نیست ، اما این
خودشناسی که در دسترس است با یک زیر
ایستاده دیگران این عملکرد ساختار دیالوگ تا انجمن است ، که در آن
حتی شرکت کننده هایی که کاملاً در مکالمه شرکت نمی کنند-
Tion قادر است خود را در اشتراک دیگران پیدا کند. بخش انجمن
Ticipants بارها و بارها از گوش دادن به اشتراک دیگران "مانند
این شما به نوعی صحبت می کنید. " با ادامه اشتراک ،
رهبر انجمن به طور مداوم داستان هر شرکت کننده را تجزیه می کند
در مورد تجربه او ، و به جای آن تجربه را در آن قرار می دهد
زبان تمایزات در حال توسعه است. تمایزها
به تدریج ساختارهای هستی شناختی را در زیرزمین آشکار کنید
عرفان ، ساختارهای مشترک برای همه تجربیات با وجود
تفاوت در جزئیات آنها. 96
وجود
مارشا این است که او یک فرد عصبانی است. من می دانم که این زندگی اوست. هنگامی که او قادر به بودن است
با عصبانیت ، هنگامی که او قادر به عصبانیت است ، ممکن است از او عصبانی شود
جف
اصلاً اما "عصبانی نیست" تا زمانی که بتواند عصبانی شود ، زندگی خود را اجرا خواهد کرد. من می دانم که شما نیستید
هنوز همه اینها را دریافت کنید شما شروع به دریافت آن می کنید. همانطور که امروز می روید ، آن را دریافت خواهید کرد. قبل از بیرون آمدن
از اینجا ، شما به منبع هویت خود خواهید رسید. چه اتفاقی می افتد اگر به منبع خود برسید
هویت ، کسی با برچسب نام زرد؟ شرکت کننده (که یک برچسب نام زرد پوشیده است ، یعنی کسی که برای اولین بار انجمن را انجام می دهد)
این دیگر مالک شما نیست. درز
بله این ساده است این چیزی است که تقریباً هیچ کس نمی داند. شما اکنون یکی از معدود افراد در آن هستید
دنیایی که این را می داند. آنچه همه افراد جهان می دانند این است که شما باید به FI X چه چیزی بپردازید
با شما اشتباه است ، شما باید از آنچه بد است ، در شما یا زندگی خودداری کنید. آنچه اکنون می دانید هر زمان است
شما در منبع چیزی قرار می گیرید ، دیگر محدود به آن نیستید. بیشتر مردم از انجام این کار می ترسند
کاری که مارشا انجام داده است. آنها عصبانیت آنقدر ناراضی هستند ، که می ترسند از این امر پیروی کنند
آنها عصبانی هستند. و آنها نمی توانند تحمل کنند ، آنها نمی توانند با آن باشند ، و بنابراین هرگز به وجود نمی رسند
عصبانی مثل این یک روش ممکن برای بودن است. آنها در برابر عصبانی بودن ، آنها را رد می کنند. در دهه 70 شما
قرار بود همه اینها را به هم بزنند. این عصبانیت است ، این هم کار نمی کند. وقتی احساس کردی
عصبانی بودید که قرار بود آن را در همه جا روی مردم اسپری کنید. این عصبانیت است. این
بسیار گلوله به عنوان سرکوب عصبانیت. چیزی به نام مسئولیت وجود دارد. همانطور که دیروز به شما گفتم
شما هنوز نمی دانید که این به چه معنی است ، اما ما قبل از انجام این کار به آن خواهیم رسید. چیزی نزدیک به
داشتن چیزی ، توانایی داشتن در کنار آن. بنابراین می خواهید نگاهی به باتلاق بیندازید
در آنجا که می ترسید ممکن است باشید یا امیدوار هستید که نیستید ، یا نمی خواهید باشید. این جایی است که
هیولا هستند. هیولاهای باریک سبز از آنچه می ترسید زندگی شما را اداره می کنند. بیشتر ما
از رسیدن به آن می ترسید ، زیرا می ترسیم که باشیم
حرف
آن وقتی صاحب آن هستید ، در منبع آن ، آن
اشمیه
دیگر مالک شما نیست. ما می ترسیم از ترس از این که ممکن است به آن برسیم. آنچه از مالکیت آن می ترسید
شما مارشا ، در آنجا متوجه شدید؟ مارشا
من متوجه می شوم که از همه و همه چیز در این دنیا عصبانی هستم. erhard (به گروه)
شما می خواهید در آن شجاعت پیدا کنید. او عصبانی است که منتظر اتفاق می افتد: همیشه عصبانی است. این همه است
بر فراز مکان این پاکسازی را که در آن جهان برای او اتفاق می افتد ، رنگ می کند. و فقط به درجه
او حاضر است با آن باشد ، در مقابل 800 نفر ایستاده و شروع به برقراری ارتباط با آن می کند ،
شما شروع به همراهی با آن می کنید. این بسیار متفاوت از این است که امیدوار باشید که شما چنین نیستید. می گفتی؟ مارشا
در این دنیا یک نفر وجود ندارد که من از آن عصبانی نیستم. درز
و این برای شما ناراحت کننده است از طریق این فرایند ، همانطور که افراد در اتاق خود را می شنوند
نگرانی هایی که به طور مکرر در صحبت از دیگران بیان شده است ، نه تنها
آیا آنها روش جدیدی برای درک وضعیت خودشان به دست می آورند ، اما
در عین حال ، از طریق متقابل ضمنی در انجمن
ساختار دیالوگ ، با توجه به افراد به تدریج است
به وجود آورد گفتگوی انجمن به این ترتیب Unconceals
احتمال رابطه عمیق بودن در بین انسان
موجودات این ارتباط ، ما پیشنهاد می کنیم ، عمیق تر و سرگرم کننده تر است-
سطح damental از تفاوت های مختلف - نژاد ، قومیت ، دین یا
سیاست - که برای ما به عنوان موانع مداوم برای همکاری در اتفاق می افتد
تمام جنبه های زندگی ما. کار Erhard ، و در حال گسترش آن-
Tation در برنامه های فعلی در سراسر جهان ، ایجاد کنید
امکان فراتر از این موانع. ■
erhard (ادامه)
"
بنابراین می خواهید در باتلاق نگاهی بیندازید
پایین در آنچه می ترسید ممکن است
یا امیدوار باشید که نبودید ، یا نمی خواهید
باشد این جایی است که هیولا ها هستند. سبز
هیولاهای باریک از آنچه می ترسید باشید
زندگی خود را اجرا کنید. بیشتر ما می ترسیم
به آن توجه کنید ، زیرا می ترسیم ممکن است اینگونه باشیم. وقتی صاحب آن هستید ، در منبع آن ، دیگر نیست
صاحب شما است. روز اول انجمن: جلسه یک
97
مارشا
بله ، زیرا من با مردم روابط می خواهم و نمی توانم نزدیک شوم. درز
به اینجا گوش دهید ، زیرا بیشتر شما نمی خواهید شجاعت این کار را داشته باشید. بنابراین شما نیاز دارید
برای بدست آوردن آن از کسانی که شجاعت دارند. که در مورد بودن چیز غم انگیزی برای او وجود دارد
عصبانی - به همین دلیل او می ترسد که او عصبانی شود ، پس از نزدیک شدن همه چیز در حال نزدیک شدن است. در گره پیچیده. مارشا
تمام زندگی من عملی در مورد شاد بودن و شاد بودن ، دادن و مراقبت از همه بوده است ،
بدن من را دوست دارد ، و آنها این کار را می کنند. حقیقت این است که من در جهان دشمن ندارم. درز
برای یک ثانیه نگه دارید. بنابراین اگر شما فردی هستید که مهارت هایی را که مارشا دارد ، مهارت های موجود است
به خوبی مربوط به مردم است ، و به نوعی که او را عمیقاً و عمیق پرورش نمی دهد. یعنی
او را پر از شادی نگذارید ، زیرا در آنجا است تا او عصبانی نشود! آیا شما می شنوید
در سفارش؟ تا عصبانی نشوید؟ مارشا در حالی که ارهارد با چند شرکت کننده دیگر کار می کرد ، ایستاد. درز
بنابراین اگر من خوب هستم تا عصبانی نشوم ، چه چیزی ادامه دارد؟ شما باید در این مورد روشن شوید. چه کسی نیست
در این مورد روشن است؟ یک شرکت کننده به نام مایک ایستاد. درز
بنابراین مایک ، اگر من به خوبی ارتباط برقرار کنم ، تا عصبانی نشوم ، وقتی خوب ارتباط برقرار می کنم ، همیشه وجود دارد
عصبانی. این به عنوان چیزی است که من مقاومت می کنم. Erhard به یک شرکت کننده دیگر نزدیک شد و تظاهرات کرد که در آن هر مرد درک کرد
دستان دیگر و تلاش کرد تا دیگری را دور کند. درز
بنابراین اگر من در برابر چیزی مقاومت می کنم ، به آنچه مقاومت می کنم وابسته هستم. همه این رقص های مربوط به چاه
در اطراف عصبانیت ، به عصبانیت وصل شده است. من هرگز احساس عمیقی از ارتباط بودن ندارم ، زیرا
آنچه در ارتباط است ادامه می یابد ، عصبانی بودن همیشه است. من حس عمیقی از تحقق ندارم
از ارتباط خوب ، زیرا آنچه همچنان ادامه دارد عصبانی است. ببینید ، من ارتباطی ندارم
خوب برای اینکه در ارتباط باشم ، من به خوبی با هم ارتباط دارم تا عصبانی نشوم. شما هرگز متوجه آن واقعی شده اید
افراد خوب ، وقتی کمی پوسته آنها را ترک می کنید ، نارضایتی و غم زیادی وجود دارد؟ می دانید ، بسیاری از افراد خوب خوب در اینجا وجود دارند. تمام کاری که شما باید انجام دهید این است که سطح را ترک کنید و سپس
نارضایتی وجود دارد آیا روشن است؟ 98
وجود
مایک
فقط کمی من می بینم که شما در اینجا علیه این آقا فشار می آورید ، و من چیزی را درک می کنم
درباره عصبانیت شما می گویید ، آن را دور می کنید ، هنوز هم آنجاست. نوع فازی. درز
وقتی او را دور می کنم ، آیا من به او وصل نشده ام؟ مایک
شما او را لمس می کنید بله. درز
نه ، به او وصل شده است. من نمی توانم از او دور شوم ، زیرا او را دور می کنم ، می توانم؟ مایک
نه شما نمی توانید. درز
بنابراین به یک معنا که من به او وابسته هستم ، من نیستم؟ مایک
و شما در حال انجام پیوست هستید. درز
هرگز به این نکته توجه نکنید که چه کسی پیوست را انجام می دهد. ارهارد به شرکت کننده دیگر بازگشت و او را به شانه های ارهارد نگه داشت. درز
بنابراین ، او اکنون من را پیدا کرده است ، درست است؟ و من نمی توانم دور شوم. او به من ادامه می دهد ، درست است؟ مایک
درست درز
تفاوت بین آن و این چیست؟ ارهارد همانطور که در نمونه قبلی انجام داد ، شرکت کننده را تحت فشار قرار داد. درز
از نظر پیوست؟ خواه جان من را نگه دارد ، یا من او را دور می کنم ، ما هستیم
حرف
به همان اندازه ضمیمه شده است. مایک
خوب روز اول انجمن: جلسه یک
99
درز
بنابراین ، هرچه که مقاومت کنید ، در نتیجه نهایی آن دقیقاً همان چیزی است که شما هستید
افراط اگر به عصبانیت معتاد باشم ، کم و بیش به عصبانیت وصل نمی شوم تا اینکه مقاومت کنم
خشم در مورد آن قسمت روشن است؟ مایک
من در مورد آن قسمت واضح هستم. درز
خوب بیایید به قسمت بعدی برویم. به دلیل عصبانی بودن ... می بینید ، چه چیزی در حال کارآیی است
Lating مربوط به مارشا است ، این در مورد عصبانیت نیست. بنابراین نتیجه ارتباط با نتیجه چیست؟ مایک
من گم شده ام درز
شما گم نشده اید شما باهوش هستید شما واضح است که شما نمی فهمید که من چه می گویم. بگو
شما می فهمید که وقتی "گم شده اید". پاک کردن؟ حرف
مایک
من می خواهم بله بگویم ، اما ... پیش بروید. درز
آیا مشخص است که شما گم نشده اید؟ مایک
واضح است که من نمی دانم در حال حاضر در مورد چه چیزی صحبت می کنید. درز
بله این کاملاً واضح است که اینطور نیست؟ بنابراین شما گم نشده اید. شما روشن هستید مایک
من آن را کردم درز
خوب اکنون ما در حال بازگشت به این تجارت هستیم که "اگر من به خوبی ارتباط برقرار کنم تا از عصبانیت جلوگیری کنم ،"
نتیجه ارتباط من به خوبی چیست؟ مایک
من از عصبانیت اجتناب می کنم. درز
عالی آیا رضایت در آن وجود دارد؟ آیا این شما را به طور کامل ترک می کند؟ 100
وجود
مایک
مقابله با عصبانیت را به تأخیر می اندازد. درز
این ممکن است این کار را انجام دهد اما این حرف من نیست. حرف من این است که با کسی ارتباط خوبی داشته باشید
باید منبع تحقق و رضایت باشد ، بله؟ مایک
این یک پیش فرض است درز
بله: یک شخص نسبتاً امن. اگر من و شما به خوبی مرتبط هستیم ، باید این حس را داشته باشیم
توسط آن مایک
خوب درز
اما اگر شما و من برای جلوگیری از عصبانیت ، نتیجه خوبی در ارتباط هستیم
رضایت و تحقق نیست: از عصبانیت خودداری می کند. بنابراین می توانید در همه جا به خوبی مرتبط باشید
مکان و قرار نیست شما را پر از شادی یا عمیقاً رضایت بخشد. این شما را ترک می کند
از عصبانیت جلوگیری کرد. شما برنده شد و آنها جایزه مشاعره را به شما دادند. آیا این واضح تر است؟ مایک
بله درز
افراد برجسته ای وجود دارند که از دستاوردهای خود پرورش نمی یابند ، زیرا آنها
به منظور عدم وجود چیزی که از وجود آن اجتناب می کنند ، انجام نمی شوند. (به مایک)
آیا شما آن را دریافت می کنید؟ مایک
تا حدی درز
خوب ، بگذارید کاملاً روشن شود. مایک
خوب "
اما اگر شما و من به خوبی در ارتباط هستیم
از عصبانیت خودداری کنید ، نتیجه خوب بودن
مرتبط رضایت و تحقق نیست: این است
اجتناب از عصبانیت روز اول انجمن: جلسه یک
101
درز
این اتاق پر از افراد بسیار موفق است. و شما افراد موفق را می شناسید؟ مایک
مطمئناً درز
و آنها لزوماً عمیقاً رضایت ندارند؟ مایک
نه آنها نیستند درز
و آنها پر از شادی نیستند. مایک
نه آنها نیستند درز
در آنجا مشکلی وجود دارد وقتی مردم این را می بینند ، مثل من و شما ، ما شروع به آمدن می کنیم
با این نتیجه گیری های احمقانه "خوب ، زندگی پس از همه ارزش آن را ندارد. شما همه این کارها را انجام می دهید و
پس چی؟ " "آیا این همه وجود دارد؟ من باید رئیس شرکت باشم ، "یا" من فوق العاده ای را مطرح کردم
خانواده. موفقیت گه است. آنچه را می خواهید انجام دهید. " مردم از موفقیت خودداری می کنند: همه این راه حل های عجیب
تهاجم موفقیت برای مردم کار نمی کند زیرا آنها این کار را انجام می دهند تا چیزی نباشند. پاک کردن؟ مایک
من این تئوری را می گیرم. درز
هنگامی که آنچه را که شما این تئوری را می نامید ، می خواهید در آن نظریه بایستید و به زندگی نگاه کنید. مردم
کسانی که ازدواج می کنند تا تنهایی نباشند ، حتی وقتی در ازدواج موفق باشند ، sim-
در پایان تنها نیست ، در حالی که هنوز به "تنهایی" وصل شده است. این کل احتمال بزرگ
ازدواج یا مرتبط بودن ، آنها در آنجا نیستند. آنها در "تنهایی" هستند. پاک کردن؟ مایک
آن قسمت واضح است. درز
کدام قسمت مشخص نیست؟ مایک
من فقط سعی می کنم همه چیز را هضم کنم. توجه: این یک "اشاره" نسبت به مکالمه نزدیک به پایان است
از روز سوم "اینجا مشکلی وجود دارد".
