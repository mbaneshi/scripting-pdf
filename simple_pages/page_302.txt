SPEAKING BEING
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
You think you’re getting off  that? Being ugly and worthless?
JANE
In some ways, but it’ll probably still be with me.
ERHARD
You’re saying that you’re getting off  it but that in some ways it’ll probably still be with you?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Couple things. First off , there’s the diff erence between apes and you and me: you and me 
have “probablys.” The ape doesn’t have any probablys, because the ape doesn’t have—listen 
up here—don’t get sucked in by her attractiveness...
(laughter)
The ape doesn’t have any “probablys” because the ape doesn’t have any language. Only you 
and I have probablys. And we invent those probablys with our mouths. We don’t know that. We 
think we’re inventing probablys by extrapolating the past into the future. You understand the 
word “extrapolate”?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
Extending the past into the future? You know you take a line that goes like this...
(drawing a line in the air)
And then it goes like that. You’re extending the line from the past into the future.
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
So, you and I think that we say probably based on this mental operation called extending the 
past into the future. And that’s why you said “probably” to me, is it not?
