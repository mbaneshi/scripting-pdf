SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (throwing the ball just out of Mike’s reach)
Why did you put your hand up there when I threw the ball?
MIKE
To catch the ball.
ERHARD
No you didn’t. Did you say, “I’m going to catch this ball?”
MIKE
To myself I did.
ERHARD
Did you really?
MIKE
Yes I did.
ERHARD (throwing the ball again out of Mike’s range)
What did you say then?
MIKE
I said...
ERHARD
You didn’t say a goddamned thing! Nothing. Afterwards, in the moment afterwards, you might
have said, “that’s not catchable.” If the ball was catchable for you, you would have reached over.
And you may or may not have caught it, but you would have reached over. Are you athletic?
(pausing)
Stop thinking! Are you athletic or not?
MIKE
I’m neither.
ERHARD
You’re a person for whom the ball is slow and fat. And I’m a person for whom the ball is very
small and fast. And the slower the ball goes, the more athletic you look. Is that clear?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
Very good. Thanks.
Forum Day Four: Session Three 497
(applause)
ERHARD (to another participant)
You got it before. And now some gas has been introduced and now you don’t get it, is that it?
(laughter)
MELINDA
I’ll keep it short, okay? I have a friend, his son is brain-damaged. His brain works fi ne except
for the part that controls his muscles. He can’t walk. If somebody throws him the ball, it’s
uncatchable.
ERHARD
Sure. If I cut your arms off  and throw you the ball, it’s uncatchable.
(laughter)
Don’t bring up this stupidity: It’s going to make you look silly. I’m not talking about some kind
of magic that if you were a rock and the ball occurred as catchable that you would reach up and
catch the ball.
MELINDA
I’m trying to see where this occurrence is.
ERHARD
It’s not in your muscles. Stick around. You’re asking the next question. Look, do you think with your
brain? You know that if we opened up your head and stuck a pencil in your brain you wouldn’t feel it?
MELINDA
I’ll accept that.
ERHARD
That’s the case. You don’t see with your brain. You see through your brain, maybe. It mediates
seeing. You don’t see with your eyes either. You know those things you didn’t see and now you
see? The eyes are a tube through which seeing comes, but not with what you see. And that’s the
case with the guy with brain damage.
MELINDA
You said it’s an ontological event, but how could an ontological event occur...
ERHARD
Because the ontological event expresses itself through a physical tube. That’s trivial.
MELINDA
That’s what I don’t get: That an ontological event could occur by cutting off  someone’s arms.
498
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
No, it does not. I said it can’t. If you can’t get it down the tube—if the tube’s blocked—your
brain, your nervous system, your muscles are just a tube to get it down. This is real simple.
We’re not talking about growing a third arm here. So it’s a trivial conversation to get stuck in
this muscles and bones and nerves thing. I’m willing to do it if we need to because I’m someone
who can stay up all night. But that’s not the conversation that you and I ought to be having
when we’re talking about your being able to behave eff ectively.
MELINDA
Okay.
ERHARD
Growing a third arm is a diff erent conversation. It’s true that your body is a tube down which
this gets expressed, but it’s only the tube. You know, I’ve worked with brain-damaged children.
There’s no less of a person there. There’s less of a person expressed. No question about it. There
are ways to get around the limits of the tubes. Blind people function with the same equipment
I’ve got at a way higher level than I do. Your body is merely the tube down which this gets
expressed. The tube is trivial.
(Melinda sitting)
About the occurring, and about access to the occurring... We now know that access to action is
in the occurring. You don’t gain access to action through decisions, and making up your mind,
and all that other nonsense. That’s a very weak access to your actions. If you checked and
counted up how many times you made up your mind and then checked how many times you
did what you made up your mind to do: very infrequently. It’s a lousy access to action. Takes
you forever to produce any eff ective action that way. Takes years of practice and discipline to
produce any eff ective action that way. And it isn’t the way to produce action, even taking years
to do it. It’s just a stupid way to behave and it’s based on a stupid explanation; an ineff ective way
to behave based on a stupid explanation.
(pausing to take a sip from a silver mug)
Now here’s another hard part. Where does the photographic image occur? Not on the paper!
Because if the photographic image occurred on the paper, everybody who looked at the paper
would see a photographic image. There are people who look at the paper and don’t see any
photographic image, that is to say, no photographic image occurs. Is that clear? Where does
the photographic image occur? This is the question you should be asking: Where does the
photographic image occur?
BARRY
When I’m shooting...
ERHARD
A photographic image is not shooting.
Forum Day Four: Session Three 499
BARRY
I’m a photographer.
ERHARD
Oh, I apologize: I forgot you were a photographer. I don’t want to know about taking pictures;
I want to know where the photographic image occurs. So if you show me a photograph: Where
does the image occur? It’s not on the paper.
BARRY
It’s the person who can recognize it there.
ERHARD
Where does that recognition happen?
BARRY
Through an association?
ERHARD
Not through association. The photographic image occurs in a medium called the possibility of
a photographic image. Now, how long is it going to take you to get this? This is pretty simple. A
photographic image occurs in a certain medium. The name of the medium is the possibility of
a photographic image. To say it a bit more rigorously, a photographic image occurs in a medium
called photographic image as a possibility. Photographic image as a presence, as an occurring,
occurs, happens in a medium called photographic image as a possibility. Is that clear?
BARRY
No.
ERHARD
Then you’re going to have to go home without that being clear then. Sorry. It’s hard.
(Barry sits)
The medium of occurrence is possibility. Possibility shapes the occurring. What Ellen and
I did was to shift the realm of possibility in which we were working. In one realm we were
working on the possibility of catching the ball. That had a smaller possibility for Ellen. In the
other realm we were working on the possibility of telling me which way the ball was spinning;
that had a bigger possibility for Ellen. Hence, the ball traveling at the same is speed, alters
its occurring speed, because occurring is a phenomenon which arises in a medium called
possibility. Not possibility like you mean possibility, something that might, maybe could,
maybe happen. Photographic image as a possibility is like—listen!—a clearing in which
photographic images can happen. It’s not a maybe, might. It’s not made up of photographic
images either. Photographic image as a possibility is not made up of photographic images,
any more than “two” as a possibility is made up of examples of two. As a matter of fact,
examples of two arise in the possibility “two.” So, access to your action, access to your feeling:
Enframing
For Heidegger, our technological understanding of Being emerges
in three stages: “challenging,” “standing-res erve,” and “enframing.”
Challenging
“The revealing that rules in modern technology,” Heidegger says
first, “is a challenging (Herausfordern), which puts to nature the
unreasonable demand that it supply energy which can be extracted
and stored as such.” Thus the “earth now reveals itself as a coal
mining district, the soil as a mineral deposit.” Heidegger protests
this development as a significant change from the days of “the old
windmill.” While the windmill served human beings, the call for its
service was left  to the wind’s blowing, since “the windmill does not
unlock energy from the air currents in order to store it.” Modern
technology, on the other hand, “sets upon nature,” always driving
on toward “the maximum yield at the minimum expense” (“QCT”
500
SPEAKING BEING
You’ve got no access to your feelings right now, do you? Yeah, you can’t feel sad if you want
to feel sad. You can’t be happy if you want to be happy. The circumstances determine your
happiness or your sadness. And all you got to deal with your feelings is fucking around with
your circumstances. So you do what you think you need to do to create circumstances that will
make you happy. And they don’t. They gratify you for a little while, and then you’re unhappy
again. So, to gain access to your actions, to gain access to your feelings and thoughts, as
actions so to speak, you need to see that your actions and thoughts and feelings are a correlate
with the occurring. And the occurring arises, occurs, in a medium called possibility. So now
the question is: “Well, how do I gain access to this possibility stuff ?” Because if I can shift
possibility, I can shift occurring; and if I can shift occurring, I can shift action. But you’ve got
to get possibility like I’m saying it, not like something that might happen. That’s an option.
Something that might happen is an option. That’s what Mike and I were talking about back
there, options. “If the ball is over there, I might be able to catch it.” That’s an option. “And if
it’s over here, it’s more likely that I’ll catch it.” That’s a better option. These are options, not
possibilities. Possibility doesn’t limit. It opens up. It frees one, not limits one. So possibility is
the medium of occurring, and occurring is the correlate of action. Does anybody not get that?
You’re starting to slide back into the fi rst day. You’re starting to wonder how to use this stuff .
“I don’t understand it.” What you’re really saying is “I don’t see its applicability. I don’t see
how I’m going to apply it, or use it. I don’t see how this is going to make me thinner, or richer,
or younger, or sexier. So I don’t understand it. If it isn’t going to make me thinner, or richer,
or younger, or sexier, then what is it?” So now the question is, “Where do I fi nd possibility?”
And the answer to that is in the ape never picking up the stick because he might fi nd bananas
hanging in the jungle clearing later on. Possibility arises in languaging. And I use the term
languaging instead of language so you don’t confuse what I’m talking about with vocabulary
and syntax and grammar. You know, music is languaging, action is languaging when it speaks,
and actions do speak don’t they? And “in a glass,” which is never said, and is yet present
without being said by virtue of what is said, that’s languaging too. And you want to know
what? Sitting in a chair is languaging. A lot of people would look at a chair and never sit in it.
It would look stupid to them: silly, uncomfortable, or nasty. Like sitting on two stakes sticking
up. You look at two stakes sticking up—that doesn’t look too comfortable to us. There are
people who look at a chair and don’t see it as a comfortable place to sit. It’s something to stand
on to get something in the cupboard that’s up high. Not a place to sit. And the way it occurs
to you is a product of languaging, not a product of what it is. Is a chair a chair? No, it’s not an
is chair, it’s an occurring chair. In other cultures it occurs as something to stand on to get up
to the cupboard that’s up high. It’s not an is chair; it’s an occurring chair. And your actions
with it are exactly like they are with the dictionary. Your actions are correlated to the object as
an occurring. So we’re sneaking up on a statement: You do have something to say about your
actions. You do have something to say about it. And why you have something to say about it is
because possibility arises in language.
At one point during this conversation, at about 10 pm, the doors to the room were opened and
about two hundred people fi led into the room and seated themselves in rows of chairs that had been
placed at the sides and rear. These were friends of the participants who had previously taken The
Forum, and who had been invited by them to join them, for this portion of the course.
in BW 320–321). As Michael E. Zimmerman has pointed out, this
new way of revealing has now overtaken even the windmill: “Forty
miles east of San Francisco in Livermore, California, thousands
of turbo-driven windmills cover the hills  as far as the eye can
see. The wind’s energy is, in fact, being  harnessed and stored to
produce electricity” (Heidegger’s Confrontation with Modernity
216). However, what stands in the way of windmills being really
useful as a power source is merely that no power can be generated
when the wind isn’t blowing. The solution, which is already likely
at hand, will be to invent super batteries that could store up the
energy for use and distribution when and where we need it. This
would transform the “freely flowing” wind into something stored
up, standing at the ready, in reserve.
Standing-Reserve
This situation reveals a second stage of the technological
understanding of Being, which Heidegger calls Bestand, or
standing-reserve. In this mode of revealing, says Heidegger,
“everything is ordered to stand by, to be immediately on hand,
indeed to stand there just so that it may be on call for a further
ordering” (“QCT” in BW 322). This mode of revealing distorts the
appearance of things: the airliner on the runway, for example,
“conceals itself as to what and how it is.”
Revealed, it stands on the taxi strip only as
standing-reserve, inasmuch as it is ordered to
insure the possibility of transportation. For this
it must be in its whole structure and in every
one of its constituent parts itself on call for
duty, i.e., ready for takeoff . (“QCT” in BW 322)
“
David Tabachnick has provided a useful contrast between
the old and new ways of revealing, between the techne of the
craft sman and the techne that we observe in current technology.
For the craft sman, “‘bringing-forth’ describes a working in
partnership or co-operation with the nature of materials to
construct an artifact, such as a chair or a house, while the
contemporary technologist is described as ‘challenging-forth’ or
changing the nature of materials to make them stronger, more
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day Four: Session Three 501
Erhard called on Jane, the young woman with whom he had interacted with on Days Two and Three
about her being “worthless” after having no one she invited come to her birthday party.
ERHARD
Jane and I were having a discussion when she was standing over there. And I said: “are you
going to act out of being worthless and ugly?” And she said “not as much but probably some.”
Right? Something close to that?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Is that true or false? It’s neither. The question is garbage. She has shaped the possibility for her
future actions because she shaped the world as an occurring, by speaking a possibility. She said
“my possibility is limited to this.”
(holding up both hands to eye level)
This is how big the possibility is. It’s that big because she said so. It’s not that big because she
believes it’s that big, and not because it is that big, not because it’s her opinion that it’s that big.
It’s that big because she said so. Remember, languaging is not just what’s coming out of your
mouth. I don’t say “in a glass,” and yet it’s there in languaging. I want to make sure nobody
confuses what we are saying with “positive thinking.” See, I’m not asking her to think positively.
I don’t like positive thinking. I’m an anti-positive thinker. I like honest thinking, not positive
thinking. I like straight thinking, not positive thinking. I know that possibility is a product of
languaging, but I don’t like the word product: possibility arises in language... and that Jane
can be a conversation for the possibility of anything she wants to be. See, where am I going to
fi nd “ugly”? Can I fi nd anything ugly in somebody’s face? This is not some nice platitudinal
horseshit. Things are ugly, but they’re ugly in people’s mouths, not on people’s faces. Ugly is not
a phenomenon that arises independent of language. My dog looks at me and sees neither ugly,
nor anything else about me, because ugly is a phenomenon that only arises in language. There’s
no ugly in anybody’s face or body. Faces and bodies are just like they are. Ugly is a phenomenon
that only arises in language. This doesn’t sound very useful, does it? It sounds what you call
abstract or conceptual. See, there’s a diff erence between is ugly and occurs as ugly. What’s
the diff erence between is ugly and occurs as ugly? Something called plasticity, malleability, or
something more aptly called possibility. If something is ugly you’ve got to adjust to it, don’t you?
(forcefully)
It is ugly so you have to adjust to it. If it occurs as ugly there’s the possibility of some
malleability, some plasticity, you might be able to shape it in a new way if it occurs as ugly. I
want you to begin to see that there’s a lot of what you deal with that only arises in language.
And because it only arises in language, you’ve got something to say about it. You’ve got
something to say about being ugly—no shit—because ugly only arises in language. I’ve seen
a lot of women whose features don’t measure the perfect standard who are extraordinarily
beautiful and so has every other man in this room. Beauty is not a matter of standard features.
flexible, longer lasting, etc.” Tabachnick continues, explaining that,
for example,
A doctor may “bring forth” the already avail-
able health of an individual through medicine,
whereas cloning or genetic engineering “chal-
lenge” the natural bounds of the body, creating
a wholly new “artifact” with diff erent charac-
teristics. As Heidegger details, earlier human
inventions did not permanently impose a new
form onto nature. Under normal conditions, be-
cause the material of an artifact was still bound
by natural characteristics, nature would always
“shine through” the imposition of the artist,
craft sman or technician. A carpenter imposes
the form of a chair onto wood, but once the
chair is finished that wood still maintains its
natural characteristics to rot and decompose
in the same way a fallen tree rots and decom-
poses on the forest floor. In other words, the
craft sman’s chair is a site of openness for the
revealing of nature. (Tabachnick 2004)
“
Tabachnick compares these earlier technologies with some that
are representative of more recent developments, “technologies
that do not co-operate with nature but attempt to replace it”:
A nuclear engineer can manipulate the struc-
ture of natural elements to produce artificial
elements. Plutonium, for example, is designed to
never abide by or return to the characteristics of
the uranium from which it was derived. The char-
acter of plutonium (i.e., its level of radioactivity)
is always artificial. Likewise, the genetically
altered human is designed to never return to the
natural characteristics of the material from which
it was derived (e.g., a sick or weak body) and
thus is always artificial. In turn, contemporary

SPEAKING BEING
It’s a way of being, not features. You know, it’s nice to have good equipment, but too fucking
bad, you’ve got the equipment you’ve got. Ugly is a conversation. That’s all it is. You can’t fi nd
ugly anyplace in the universe except in people’s mouths. That’s a metaphor. Now I’ll say it
rigorously. You can’t fi nd ugly anyplace but in languaging. And if you’re listening to this like
some platitude, then you are truly an asshole. This is hard stuff  I’m taking about. Not “nice
nice.” And “worthless.” Where am I going to fi nd “worthless”?
JANE
In the conversation “worthless.”
ERHARD
Yeah. Beautiful. See, you’ve got something to say about “worthless.” You’ve got nothing to
say about your feelings. You can’t feel anything but what you’re feeling. You’ve got nothing to
say about how you feel. But you’ve got something to say about worthless and ugly. Because
worthless and ugly are a conversation, that’s all. One is a conversation for being worthless, or
one is a conversation for being ugly. And that becomes the possibility in which life and the
world and your own image occurs for you. You don’t see yourself when you look in the mirror.
You don’t see yourself like an is, you see yourself like an occur; you see yourself as an occurring
self, not an is self. And what occurs in the mirror is not in the mirror. It’s in languaging,
therefore, you have access to what occurs in the mirror: Like a conversation for the possibility
of being beautiful. It’s idiotic to walk around saying “I’m beautiful,” especially if you look
like me. You look like her, maybe, because there’s some agreement for that. I didn’t say I walk
around speaking positively. I said it’s possible for me to be engaged in the conversation for the
possibility of being beautiful. I and you and the world will occur in the space, the clearing given
by that conversation for possibility. And my actions, and my feelings, and my thoughts, will be a
correlate of that occurring. And my actions, and my feelings, and my thoughts will work on the
world. You getting this?
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
And so you have something to say about this. What you say about it is none of my business.
That’s your business. We know why you said you were ugly and worthless, because you got
something out of that, right? For the payoff . Remember the payoff  conversation?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
And so ugly and worthless was a racket for a payoff . But there’s no payoff  for the possibility of
beauty. Beauty as an assertion, “I am beautiful,” like describing yourself, like you are an object,
there’s a payoff  in that. But there’s no payoff  in the possibility of beauty. As a matter of fact it
puts you further at risk, because now you’re at risk for being beautiful. When you’re ugly you
technological artifacts do not disclose nature.
And, because in a technological society so much
of our world is filled with these “undisclosing
artifacts,” we are cut off  from, become unaware
of, or forget the essential movedness or tran-
sience of existence. (Ibid.)
We remind the reader that we are not advocating a universal
return to wooden furniture; we do not regret advances in medical
science that employ new materials. To do so would be tantamount
to the demonstration Wes carried out during The Forum, earlier
in Day Four, of arguing with the floor. At the same time we are not
making an ethical statement concerning what the technological
understanding of Being has done to human beings such that
we might, as a matter of course, accept without question even
radically dangerous technological advances. Here we are simply
focusing on the view that we are already in a technological way
of Being-in-the-world, and therefore, what is at issue is the way of
being human that has emerged with these developments.
One principle way of being human that has emerged is one that
Erhard himself has exemplified in his development of his technology
of transformation: entrepreneurship. The term “entrepreneur”
stems from the French term entreprendre, to undertake. An
entrepreneur is an enterpriser. Far from accepting or even tolerating
the way things already are, the entrepreneur envisions and reveals,
through originary naming, new possibilities which alter the way
the world occurs. With language we impact the occurring world
and consequently, our Being, for our Being is always and already in
a dance with the occurring world. We bring into Being what could
never be without being said into Being: we speak Being.
The relationship to modern technology at work in Erhard’s
technology of transformation does not immediately square with
Heidegger’s persistent complaint that holds our technological way
of being as presenting us with profound danger. The diff erence is
subtle, and will require us to walk a thin line as both thinkers are
nevertheless treading the same waters.
For instance, if we envision Heidegger’s understanding of
our technological way of being as harmonic with the in-order-to

don’t have to risk much. You don’t have to put your lines out when you’re ugly. You all awake?
If you’re beautiful, you’ve got to put your lines out. You understand why?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Do you understand trolling?
JANE
Yeah.
(laughter)
ERHARD
Trolling is a game called being alive. And it’s as meaningful as everything else in life. Zero.
Therefore you’re free to play. And there are certain agreements in society about playing. And
society is weird, but that’s too bad: That’s what we got. I may not get a chance to talk to you
again tonight, and I want you to know how deeply grateful I am for your contribution to this
Forum. You’re really beautiful.
JANE
Thank you.
She sat to long applause from the group.
Erhard moved to the chalkboard, and drew three circles. The fi rst two he labeled “story” and “what
happened.”
ERHARD
Remember on the fi rst day, we drew these two circles. One was your “story” and the other
circle was “what happened.” So there was what happened, and there was your story about what
happened, and then we talked about the vicious circle where those two domains got collapsed,
and you couldn’t tell the diff erence between what happened and your story about what happened.
And you began to think that your story about what happened is what happened. And that makes
people suff er. Just like putting your hand on the gas stove makes you suff er. That’s why you
can’t trust psychology, because all of the then-known facts in psychology had been established
with experiments with rats and college sophomores, neither one of which might be human—I
don’t know about college sophomores, but I know that rats are not like human beings. And the
diff erence between a rat and a human being is a rat will stop crawling into the oven if it gets
burned, and human beings will keep crawling into the oven. Forever. Why? Because “it’s the right
fucking oven, and I believe in it.” And then we got more sophisticated and said there were two
realms of existence: that what existed, existed as a presence, and what existed, the same stuff , exists
as a concept. These are two distinct realms of existence, domains of existence.
mechanism of the “they” self, the two thinkers appear side-by-side,
but this is only a semblance. For Heidegger, one notable eff ect of
understanding the world as a source of resources is that humans
have surrendered their role as the self-certain ontologically centered
subject. Since standing-reserve is an “inclusive rubric,” it moves us
beyond the Cartesian subject-object model in which we have come to
conceptualize our relationship to things. Instead, says Dreyfus, “we are
passing from the subject-object stage to the stage in which the culture
is becoming, one might say, one big cybernetic system” (“Gaining”).
Clearly, this is not the overcoming of Cartesian subjectivity that the
early Heidegger of Being and Time and Erhard—from the est Training to
the present—have been working toward. It is not the opening for a new
possibility of Being for human beings. Instead:
As soon as what is unconcealed no longer
concerns man even as object, but exclusively
as standing-reserve, and man in the midst of
objectlessness is nothing but the orderer of the
standing-reserve, then he comes to the brink of
a very precipitous fall, that is, he comes to the
point where he himself will have to be taken as
standing-reserve. (“QCT” in BW 332, emphasis
added)
“
This precipitous fall, we off er, has already taken place: this is the
way of being human The Forum addresses in its participants from
the very beginning. Those seeking to improve, to acquire the tips
and techniques to overcome and change their lives for the better,
who take any morsel of wisdom and put it to use, all the better to
order it, but in the process they—we—unwittingly rob the truth,
as unconcealment, of its power—this is the way of being that self-
destructs against the bulwark of the Nothing the inquiry of The
Forum brings to presence.
Enframing
And so, we arrive at the final stage in the way modern technology
reveals the world: “the essence of modern technology,” says
Heidegger, “lies in enframing [Gestell]” (“QCT” in BW 328). This

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (indicating the “story” circle)
In this realm there are things like explanations.
(indicating the “what happened” circle)
And in this realm there are things like experience. So one is the experience and the other
is the explanation of the experience. This was the whole story at the time we discussed this
earlier. We were going backwards. We got to zero, we got to empty and meaningless. Now
we’re seeing that there are two sides to The Forum. The fi rst side is “What is the already
always being of human beings?” And the other side is “What is the possibility of being for
human beings?” Now you heard “What is the possibility of being for human beings” as the
something maybe, could I, might be, maybe, like some stupid image you got of yourself as
thin and sexy and young and rich, or whatever your silly notion is for your self. Holy. It fi ts
in there. The same crap.
(indicating the fi rst two circles)
That’s what you got born with. That’s what came with the package—those two domains. There’s
another domain.
(drawing a new circle to the left of the “what happened” circle)
It doesn’t come with the package. You don’t get it for free.
(indicating the “story” circle)
You can talk about that domain right here, but that’s talking about it. That’s like eating the
menu.
(indicating the third, still empty circle to the left of the “what happened” circle and of the “story”
circle)
A lot of people talking about this domain.
(indicating the “what happened” circle)
You can even have experiences of it. People who merely have the experience of it get weird. Lot
a weird people in this room, by the way. They gravitate to California.
(laughter)
People with the experience of that other domain: Makes them weird. They can’t get over it, so they
stay weird. They’ve got no mastery of the domain. They don’t dwell in the domain; they don’t come
from the domain. They don’t dwell in it, but they’ve touched it experientially. Everybody in the room
has had that experience. Everybody. Some of you haven’t had enough of that experience to be weird
yet, that’s all. You know that experience where you don’t have to eat, where you don’t have to go to
the bathroom, and you don’t have a home, and there’s nothing but what you’re doing. You’re not even
there, right? It’s like when you get out of the way, and there’s that thing that happens when you’re out
of the way? By the way, when do you come back? When it goes bad. Right away you’re right there:
“Oh shit!”
is the culmination, the gathering of the challenging-forth and
ordering, the box in which human beings as resources already
find themselves at this juncture in our history. To employ the
vernacular, the technological way of Being is a done deal: “The
actual threat has already aff licted man in his essence. . . . Thus the
question as to how we are to arrive at a relationship to the essence
of technology, asked in this way, always comes too late” (“QCT” in
BW 333, 329). In a 1966 interview with the German newsmagazine
Der Spiegel, asked what was missing in the world when, aft er all,
everything seemed to be functioning and production was at a
peak, Heidegger replied: “Everything is functioning. This is exactly
what is so uncanny, that everything is functioning and that the
functioning drives us more and more to even further functioning,
and that technology tears men loose from the earth and uproots
them” (in Zimmerman’s Heidegger’s Confrontation with Modernity
199, emphasis added). Thus uprooted, says Dreyfus, human
beings “become a resource to be used, and more importantly to be
enhanced, just like any other resource” (“Gaining”).
And yet, it is Erhard’s technology of transformation that brings
forth its participants to arrive at such a relationship to the essence
of technology, right in the midst of being torn loose from the earth,
used and enhanced as any resource would be, caught up in the
relentless logic of the in-order-to. Rather than turn away from the
technological way of being we are thrown to be, the inquiry of The
Forum directs its participants to come face-to-face with it, to own
up to it, to be in the trap that it is for human being. ■

Erhard (پرتاب توپ فقط از دسترس مایک)
چرا وقتی توپ را پرتاب کردم ، دست خود را در آنجا گذاشتید؟ مایک
برای گرفتن توپ درز
نه شما این کار را نکردید گفتی ، "من قصد دارم این توپ را بگیرم؟"
مایک
به خودم من این کار را کردم. درز
واقعاً؟ مایک
بله من انجام دادم Erhard (پرتاب دوباره توپ از محدوده مایک)
پس چی گفتی؟ مایک
گفتم ... erhard
شما یک چیز خدادادی نگفتید! هیچی پس از آن ، در لحظه بعد ، ممکن است
گفته اند ، "این قابل قبول نیست." اگر توپ برای شما قابل دستیابی بود ، می رسیدید. و ممکن است شما آن را گرفتار کرده باشید ، اما به او رسیده اید. آیا شما ورزشکار هستید؟ (مکث)
دیگر فکر نکنید! آیا شما ورزشکار هستید یا نه؟ مایک
من نه درز
شما فردی هستید که توپ برای آن آهسته و چاق است. و من فردی هستم که توپ خیلی زیاد است
کوچک و سریع و هرچه توپ آهسته تر می رود ، به نظر می رسد ورزشکار تر است. آیا این واضح است؟ مایک
بله درز
خیلی خوب ممنون روز چهارم انجمن: جلسه سه 497
(تشویق)
erhard (به یک شرکت کننده دیگر)
شما قبلاً آن را دریافت کردید و اکنون مقداری بنزین معرفی شده است و اکنون آن را دریافت نمی کنید ، این است؟ (خنده)
ملیندا
من آن را کوتاه نگه می دارم ، خوب؟ من یک دوست دارم ، پسرش آسیب دیده به مغز است. مغز او به جز کار می کند
برای بخشی که عضلات خود را کنترل می کند. او نمی تواند راه برود. اگر کسی توپ را به او پرتاب کند ، این است
غیر قابل قبول درز
مطمئناً اگر بازوهای شما را قطع کنم و توپ را به شما پرتاب کنم ، غیرقابل تحمل است. (خنده)
این حماقت را مطرح نکنید: این باعث می شود شما احمقانه به نظر برسید. من در مورد نوعی صحبت نمی کنم
از جادویی که اگر شما یک سنگ بودید و توپ به همان اندازه قابل دستیابی بود که به دست می رسید و
توپ را بگیرید. ملیندا
من سعی می کنم ببینم این اتفاق کجاست. درز
این در عضلات شما نیست. دور هم بچسب شما سوال بعدی را می پرسید. ببین ، آیا با خود فکر می کنید
مغز؟ شما می دانید که اگر ما سر شما را باز کردیم و یک مداد را در مغز خود گرفتیم ، احساس نمی کنید؟ ملیندا
من آن را می پذیرم درز
این مورد است شما با مغز خود نمی بینید. شما از طریق مغز خود می بینید ، شاید. واسطه می شود
دیدن شما هم با چشمان خود نمی بینید. شما آن چیزهایی را که ندیده اید و اکنون می دانید
می بینید؟ چشم ها لوله ای هستند که از طریق آن دیدن می آید ، اما نه با آنچه می بینید. و این
مورد با مرد با آسیب مغزی. ملیندا
شما گفتید که این یک رویداد هستی شناختی است ، اما چگونه می توان یک رویداد هستی شناختی رخ داد ... erhard
زیرا واقعه هستی شناختی خود را از طریق یک لوله فیزیکی بیان می کند. این بی اهمیت است ملیندا
این همان چیزی است که من دریافت نمی کنم: که یک رویداد هستی شناختی با قطع اسلحه شخصی می تواند رخ دهد. 498
وجود
درز
نه ، اینطور نیست. گفتم نمی تواند. اگر نمی توانید آن را از لوله پایین بیاورید - اگر لوله مسدود شده باشد - شما
مغز ، سیستم عصبی شما ، عضلات شما فقط یک لوله برای پایین آمدن آن است. این ساده است. ما در مورد رشد بازوی سوم در اینجا صحبت نمی کنیم. بنابراین این یک مکالمه بی اهمیت است که گیر کرده اید
این ماهیچه ها و استخوان ها و اعصاب. من در صورت نیاز مایل به انجام این کار هستم زیرا من کسی هستم
چه کسی می تواند تمام شب بیدار بماند. اما این مکالمه ای نیست که من و شما باید انجام دهیم
هنگامی که ما در مورد شما صحبت می کنیم که قادر به رفتار با احتیاط باشید. ملیندا
خوب درز
رشد بازوی سوم یک گفتگوی متفاوت است. درست است که بدن شما لوله ای است که
این بیان می شود ، اما فقط لوله است. می دانید ، من با کودکان آسیب دیده مغز کار کرده ام. کمتر کسی در آنجا وجود ندارد. کمتر شخص بیان شده است. بدون سوالی در مورد آن در آنجا
راه هایی برای دستیابی به محدوده لوله ها هستند. افراد نابینا با همان تجهیزات کار می کنند
من در سطح بالاتری نسبت به من قرار گرفته ام. بدن شما فقط لوله ای است که این کار می شود
بیان شده لوله بی اهمیت است. (نشستن ملیندا)
در مورد اتفاقات ، و در مورد دسترسی به اتفاقات ... اکنون می دانیم که دسترسی به عمل است
در اتفاق شما از طریق تصمیمات به عمل دسترسی پیدا نمی کنید و ذهن خود را می گیرید ،
و همه آن مزخرفات دیگر. این یک دسترسی بسیار ضعیف به اقدامات شما است. اگر بررسی کردید و
حساب کرد چند بار ذهن خود را ایجاد کرده اید و سپس چند بار شما بررسی کردید
آیا آنچه را که فکر کرده اید انجام دادید: بسیار نادر است. این یک دسترسی بد به عمل است. برداشتن
شما برای همیشه برای تولید هرگونه عمل مؤثر از این طریق. سالها تمرین و نظم و انضباط را به
هرگونه عمل عملی را از این طریق تولید کنید. و این راهی برای تولید عمل نیست ، حتی سالها
برای انجام آن این فقط یک روش احمقانه برای رفتار است و مبتنی بر یک توضیح احمقانه است. یک روش ناکارآمد
بر اساس یک توضیح احمقانه رفتار کنید. (مکث برای گرفتن جرعه از لیوان نقره ای)
اکنون یک بخش سخت دیگر است. تصویر عکاسی از کجا رخ می دهد؟ نه روی کاغذ! زیرا اگر تصویر عکاسی روی کاغذ رخ دهد ، همه کسانی که به کاغذ نگاه می کردند
یک تصویر عکاسی را مشاهده می کند. افرادی هستند که به کاغذ نگاه می کنند و هیچ چیزی را نمی بینند
تصویر عکاسی ، یعنی هیچ تصویری عکاسی رخ نمی دهد. آیا این واضح است؟ کجا
تصویر عکاسی رخ می دهد؟ این سوالی است که باید بپرسید: کجا
تصویر عکاسی رخ می دهد؟ باری
وقتی من تیراندازی می کنم ... erhard
یک تصویر عکاسی تیراندازی نیست. روز چهارم انجمن: جلسه سه 499
باری
من یک عکاس هستم درز
اوه ، من عذرخواهی می کنم: فراموش کردم شما عکاس هستید. من نمی خواهم در مورد عکس گرفتن بدانم.
من می خواهم بدانم که تصویر عکاسی در کجا رخ می دهد. بنابراین اگر عکسی به من نشان دهید: کجا
آیا تصویر رخ می دهد؟ روی کاغذ نیست باری
این شخصی است که می تواند آن را در آنجا تشخیص دهد. درز
این شناخت از کجا اتفاق می افتد؟ باری
از طریق یک انجمن؟ درز
نه از طریق ارتباط تصویر عکاسی در رسانه ای به نام احتمال وجود دارد
یک تصویر عکاسی حال ، چه مدت طول می کشد تا شما را به دست آورد؟ این بسیار ساده است بوها
تصویر عکاسی در یک محیط خاص رخ می دهد. نام رسانه امکان وجود دارد
یک تصویر عکاسی برای گفتن آن کمی دقیق تر ، یک تصویر عکاسی در یک رسانه رخ می دهد
تصویر عکاسی به عنوان یک امکان نامیده می شود. تصویر عکاسی به عنوان یک حضور ، به عنوان یک اتفاق ،
اتفاق می افتد ، در رسانه ای به نام تصویر عکاسی به عنوان یک امکان اتفاق می افتد. آیا این واضح است؟ باری
شماره erhard
سپس می خواهید بدون آنکه روشن باشد به خانه بروید. ببخشید سخت است (باری نشسته)
محیط وقوع امکان دارد. احتمال وجود دارد. چه الن و
من این کار را کردم که قلمرو امکان را که در آن کار می کردیم تغییر دهم. در یک قلمرو ما بودیم
کار بر روی امکان گرفتن توپ. این امکان کوچکتر برای الن داشت. در
قلمرو دیگری که ما در حال کار بر روی این امکان بودیم که به من بگوییم توپ در حال چرخش است.
این احتمال بیشتری برای الن داشت. از این رو ، توپ که با همان سرعت حرکت می کند ، تغییر می کند
سرعت آن رخ می دهد ، زیرا اتفاق می افتد پدیده ای است که در رسانه ای به نام ایجاد می شود
امکان امکان پذیر نیست مثل شما امکان ، چیزی که ممکن است ، ممکن است ،
شاید اتفاق بیفتد تصویر عکاسی به عنوان یک امکان مانند - لیست کردن! - پاکسازی که در آن
تصاویر عکاسی می توانند اتفاق بیفتند. شاید ممکن است باشد. این از عکاسی ساخته نشده است
تصاویر یا تصویر عکاسی به عنوان یک امکان از تصاویر عکاسی تشکیل نشده است ،
بیش از "دو" به عنوان یک امکان از نمونه هایی از دو ساخته شده است. در واقع ،
نمونه هایی از دو در امکان "دو" بوجود می آیند. بنابراین ، دسترسی به عمل خود ، دسترسی به احساس خود را:
محرمانه
برای هایدگر ، درک تکنولوژیکی ما از ظهور
در سه مرحله: "چالش برانگیز" ، "ایستاده ارشاد" و "Enframing".
به چالش برانگیز
هایدگر می گوید: "آشکار کردن قوانین در فناوری مدرن."
اول ، "یک چالش برانگیز است (HeraUsfordern) ، که طبیعت را به وجود می آورد
تقاضای غیر منطقی مبنی بر تأمین انرژی که می تواند استخراج شود
و به همین ترتیب ذخیره شده است. " بنابراین "زمین اکنون خود را به عنوان یک زغال سنگ نشان می دهد
منطقه معدن ، خاک به عنوان یک ذخایر معدنی. " اعتراضات هایدگر
این پیشرفت به عنوان یک تغییر قابل توجه از روزهای "قدیمی"
آسیاب بادی. " در حالی که آسیاب بادی به انسان خدمت می کرد ، خواستار آن است
سرویس به باد می وزد ، زیرا "آسیاب بادی نمی کند
برای ذخیره آن ، انرژی را از جریان های هوا باز کنید. " مدرن
از طرف دیگر ، فناوری "طبیعت را تنظیم می کند" ، همیشه رانندگی می کند
به سمت "حداکثر عملکرد با حداقل هزینه" ("QCT"
500
وجود
شما در حال حاضر به احساسات خود دسترسی ندارید ، آیا؟ بله ، اگر می خواهید احساس غم و اندوه نمی کنید
احساس غم و اندوه اگر می خواهید خوشحال باشید نمی توانید خوشحال باشید. شرایط شما را تعیین می کند
خوشبختی یا غم و اندوه شما. و تمام آنچه شما باید با احساسات خود مقابله کنید ، با آنها لعنتی است
شرایط شما بنابراین شما آنچه را که فکر می کنید باید برای ایجاد شرایطی انجام دهید انجام می دهید
شما را خوشحال کنید و آنها نمی کنند آنها برای مدتی شما را خوشحال می کنند ، و بعد ناراضی هستید
دوباره بنابراین ، برای دستیابی به اقدامات خود ، به عنوان دسترسی به احساسات و افکار خود ، مانند
اقداماتی برای صحبت کردن ، باید ببینید که اعمال و افکار و احساسات شما یک ارتباط است
با اتفاق و اتفاق می افتد ، در رسانه ای به نام امکان رخ می دهد. بنابراین اکنون
سوال این است: "خوب ، چگونه می توانم به این موارد امکان دسترسی پیدا کنم؟" چون اگر بتوانم تغییر کنم
احتمال ، من می توانم اتفاق بیفتد. و اگر بتوانم تغییر کنم ، می توانم عمل را تغییر دهم. اما شما باید
برای به دست آوردن امکان مانند من که می گویم ، نه مانند اتفاقی که ممکن است رخ دهد. این یک گزینه است اتفاقی که ممکن است رخ دهد گزینه ای است. این همان چیزی است که من و مایک در مورد آن صحبت می کردیم
در آنجا ، گزینه ها "اگر توپ در آنجا باشد ، ممکن است بتوانم آن را بگیرم." این یک گزینه است "و اگر
اینجا تمام شده است ، به احتمال زیاد من آن را خواهم گرفت. " این گزینه بهتری است.
امکانات احتمال محدود نیست. باز می شود یکی را آزاد می کند ، نه محدود. بنابراین امکان وجود دارد
محیط اتفاق می افتد و اتفاق می افتد ، ارتباط عمل است. آیا کسی آن را دریافت نمی کند؟ شما شروع به بازگشت به روز اول می کنید. شما شروع به تعجب می کنید که چگونه از این موارد استفاده کنید. "من آن را درک نمی کنم." آنچه شما واقعاً می گویید این است: "من کاربرد آن را نمی بینم. من نمی بینم
چگونه می خواهم آن را اعمال کنم یا از آن استفاده کنم. من نمی بینم که چگونه این باعث می شود من نازک تر یا ثروتمندتر شود ،
یا جوان تر یا جنسی تر. بنابراین من آن را درک نمی کنم. اگر قرار نیست من را نازک تر یا ثروتمندتر کند ،
یا جوان تر یا جنسی تر ، پس چیست؟ " بنابراین اکنون سؤال این است ، "من از کجا می توانم از کجا استفاده کنم؟"
و جواب آن در میمون است که هرگز چوب را جمع نمی کند زیرا او ممکن است موزها را از بین ببرد
بعداً در جنگل آویزان شد. امکان در زبان زدن بوجود می آید. و من از اصطلاح استفاده می کنم
به جای زبان زبانی ، بنابراین آنچه را که من با واژگان صحبت می کنم اشتباه نمی گیرید
و نحو و دستور زبان. می دانید ، موسیقی زبان است ، وقتی صحبت می کند ، اکشن زبان است ،
و اقدامات صحبت نمی کنند؟ و "در یک لیوان" ، که هرگز گفته نمی شود ، و هنوز وجود دارد
بدون اینکه گفته شود به واسطه آنچه گفته می شود ، این نیز زبان است. و شما می خواهید بدانید
چی؟ نشستن در یک صندلی زبان است. بسیاری از مردم به یک صندلی نگاه می کنند و هرگز در آن نمی نشینند. برای آنها احمقانه به نظر می رسد: احمقانه ، ناراحت کننده یا تند و زننده. مثل نشستن روی دو سهام که چسبیده است
بالا شما به دو سهام چسبیده نگاه می کنید - که برای ما خیلی راحت به نظر نمی رسد. وجود دارد
افرادی که به صندلی نگاه می کنند و آن را به عنوان مکانی راحت برای نشستن نمی بینند. این چیزی است که باید بایستد
برای به دست آوردن چیزی در کمد که بالا است. جایی برای نشستن نیست. و نحوه بروز آن
برای شما محصولی از زبان است ، نه محصولی از آنچه در آن است. صندلی صندلی است؟ نه ، این یک نیست
صندلی است ، یک صندلی موجود است. در فرهنگ های دیگر به عنوان چیزی برای ایستادن برای بلند شدن اتفاق می افتد
به کمد که بالا است. این یک صندلی است ؛ این یک صندلی موجود است و اقدامات شما
با آن دقیقاً مانند آنها با فرهنگ لغت است. اقدامات شما با شیء همبستگی دارد
یک اتفاق بنابراین ما در حال بیان بیانیه ای هستیم: شما چیزی برای گفتن در مورد خود دارید
اقدامات شما چیزی برای گفتن در مورد آن دارید. و چرا چیزی برای گفتن در مورد آن دارید
زیرا امکان در زبان بوجود می آید. در یک لحظه در طول این مکالمه ، حدود ساعت 10 بعد از ظهر ، درهای اتاق باز شد و
حدود دویست نفر FI وارد اتاق شدند و خود را در ردیف صندلی هایی که بودند نشستند
در طرفین و عقب قرار می گیرد. اینها دوستان شرکت کنندگان بودند که قبلاً این کار را کرده بودند
انجمن ، و چه کسی توسط آنها دعوت شده بود تا به آنها بپیوندند ، برای این بخش از دوره. در BW 320-321). همانطور که مایکل ا. زیمرمن اشاره کرده است ، این
روش جدید آشکار شدن اکنون حتی آسیاب بادی را پشت سر گذاشته است: "چهل سالگی
مایل در شرق سانفرانسیسکو در لیورمور ، کالیفرنیا ، هزاران نفر
آسیاب های بادی با محور توربو تپه ها را تا آنجا که می تواند بپوشاند
ببینید انرژی باد ، در حقیقت ، مهار و ذخیره شده است
برق تولید کنید "(رویارویی هایدگر با مدرنیته
216) با این حال ، آنچه واقعاً در راه آسیاب های بادی قرار دارد
مفید به عنوان منبع تغذیه صرفاً این است که هیچ نیرویی قابل تولید نیست
وقتی باد می وزد. راه حل ، که از قبل محتمل است
در دست ، اختراع باتری های فوق العاده ای خواهد بود که می توانند آن را ذخیره کنند
انرژی برای استفاده و توزیع چه زمانی و در کجا به آن نیاز داریم. این
باد "آزادانه جریان" را به چیزی ذخیره شده تبدیل می کند
بالا ، ایستاده در آماده ، در رزرو. ایستاده
این وضعیت مرحله دوم تکنولوژیکی را نشان می دهد
درک وجود ، که هایدگر آن را بهترین و یا
ایستاده- هایدگر می گوید ، در این شیوه فاش کردن ،
"به همه چیز دستور داده می شود که در کنار هم بایستند ، بلافاصله در دست باشند ،
در واقع برای ایستادن در آنجا به گونه ای که ممکن است در تماس بیشتر باشد
سفارش "(" QCT "در BW 322). این نحوه آشکار کردن تحریف
ظاهر چیزها: به عنوان مثال هواپیما در باند فرودگاه
"خود را پنهان می کند که چه چیزی و چگونه است."
فاش شد ، فقط روی نوار تاکسی ایستاده است
با ایستادن ، از آنجا که به آن دستور داده شده است
احتمال حمل و نقل را بیمه کنید. برای این
باید در کل ساختار و در هر صورت باشد
یکی از قسمتهای تشکیل دهنده آن در خواستار آن است
وظیفه ، یعنی آماده برای برخاستن. ("QCT" در BW 322)
"
دیوید تاباچنیک تضاد مفیدی بین
روشهای قدیمی و جدید آشکار کردن ، بین تکنیک
Craft Sman و Techne که در فناوری فعلی مشاهده می کنیم. برای Sman Craft ، "" آوردن-پیش "توصیف کار در
مشارکت یا همکاری با ماهیت مواد
یک مصنوعات مانند صندلی یا خانه را بسازید ، در حالی که
تکنسین معاصر به عنوان "چالش برانگیز" یا
تغییر ماهیت مواد برای قوی تر شدن آنها ، بیشتر
erhard (ادامه)
روز چهارم: جلسه سه 501
ارهارد به جین ، زن جوانی که با او در روزهای دو و سه تعامل داشت ، فراخواند
در مورد "بی ارزش بودن" پس از داشتن کسی که او دعوت نشده است به جشن تولد خود بیاید. درز
من و جین وقتی او در آنجا ایستاده بود بحث می کردیم. و من گفتم: "شما هستید
آیا می خواهید از بی ارزش و زشت عمل کنید؟ " و او گفت: "نه به اندازه بلکه احتمالاً برخی."
درست است؟ چیزی نزدیک به آن؟ جین
بله درز
آیا این درست است یا نادرست؟ این هیچکدام نیست سوال زباله است. او این امکان را برای او شکل داده است
اقدامات آینده به دلیل اینکه او جهان را به عنوان یک اتفاق ، با صحبت کردن یک امکان ، شکل داد. او گفت
"احتمال من محدود به این است."
(نگه داشتن هر دو دست به سطح چشم)
این احتمال بزرگ است. این بسیار بزرگ است زیرا او چنین گفت. این خیلی بزرگ نیست زیرا او
معتقد است که این بسیار بزرگ است ، و نه به این دلیل که بزرگ است ، نه به این دلیل که نظر او این است که این بزرگ است. این بسیار بزرگ است زیرا او چنین گفت. به یاد داشته باشید ، زبان زدن فقط چیزی نیست که از شما بیرون می آید
دهان من نمی گویم "در یک لیوان" ، و با این وجود در زبان زایی وجود دارد. من می خواهم هیچ کس را مطمئن کنم
آنچه را که ما با "تفکر مثبت" می گوییم گیج می کند. ببینید ، من از او نمی خواهم که مثبت فکر کند. من فکر مثبت را دوست ندارم. من یک متفکر ضد مثبت هستم. من فکر صادقانه را دوست دارم ، مثبت نیست
فکر کردن من فکر مستقیم را دوست دارم ، نه تفکر مثبت. من می دانم که این امکان محصول است
زبان زدن ، اما من کلمه محصول را دوست ندارم: امکان در زبان ایجاد می شود ... و آن جین
می تواند یک مکالمه برای امکان هر چیزی باشد که می خواهد باشد. ببینید ، کجا می روم
"زشت"؟ آیا می توانم در چهره شخصی هر چیزی زشت باشم؟ این یک پلاستیکی خوب نیست
نعل اسب اوضاع زشت است ، اما در دهان افراد زشت است ، نه بر چهره افراد. زشت نیست
پدیده ای که مستقل از زبان است. سگ من به من نگاه می کند و نه زشت می بیند ،
و نه چیز دیگری در مورد من ، زیرا زشت پدیده ای است که فقط در زبان بوجود می آید. وجود دارد
در چهره و بدن هر کسی زشت نیست. صورت و بدن دقیقاً مانند آنهاست. زشت یک پدیده است
این فقط در زبان بوجود می آید. این به نظر نمی رسد بسیار مفید باشد ، آیا؟ به نظر می رسد آنچه شما تماس می گیرید
انتزاعی یا مفهومی. ببینید ، تفاوت بین زشت است و به عنوان زشت رخ می دهد. چه چیزی
تفاوت بین زشت است و به عنوان زشت اتفاق می افتد؟ چیزی به نام انعطاف پذیری ، انعطاف پذیری ، یا
چیزی مناسب تر به نام امکان. اگر چیزی زشت است ، باید آن را تنظیم کنید ، اینطور نیست؟ (به زور)
این زشت است بنابراین شما باید با آن تنظیم کنید. اگر به عنوان زشت اتفاق بیفتد ، احتمال برخی وجود دارد
قابلیت انعطاف پذیری ، برخی از انعطاف پذیری ، ممکن است در صورت بروز زشت ، بتوانید آن را به روشی جدید شکل دهید. من
می خواهید شما شروع به دیدن کنید که بسیاری از آنچه با آن سر و کار دارید فقط در زبان بوجود می آید. و از آنجا که فقط به زبان بوجود می آید ، شما چیزی برای گفتن در مورد آن دارید. شما باید
حرفی برای گفتن در مورد زشت بودن - نه گهواره - زیرا زشت فقط در زبان بوجود می آید. من دیده ام
بسیاری از زنانی که ویژگی های آنها استاندارد کاملی را که فوق العاده هستند اندازه گیری نمی کنند
زیبا و به همین ترتیب هر مرد دیگری در این اتاق دارد. زیبایی موضوع ویژگی های استاندارد نیست. انعطاف پذیر ، ماندگار طولانی تر و غیره. " Tabachnick ادامه می دهد ، توضیح می دهد ،
به عنوان مثال ،
یک پزشک ممکن است در حال حاضر "در دسترس" باشد
سلامت قادر به یک فرد از طریق پزشکی ،
در حالی که کلونینگ یا مهندسی ژنتیک "کلبه-
lenge "مرزهای طبیعی بدن ، ایجاد می کند
یک "مصنوعات" کاملاً جدید با کاراکتر متفاوت
teristics همانطور که جزئیات هایدگر ، انسان قبلی
اختراعات به طور دائم جدید تحمیل نکردند
روی طبیعت شکل می گیرد. در شرایط عادی ،
علت این که مواد یک مصنوعات هنوز محدود شده است
با توجه به ویژگی های طبیعی ، طبیعت همیشه
"درخشش از طریق" تحمیل هنرمند ،
کاردستی Sman یا تکنسین. یک نجار تحمیل می کند
شکل یک صندلی روی چوب ، اما یک بار
صندلی به پایان رسیده است که چوب هنوز هم خود را حفظ می کند
خصوصیات طبیعی برای پوسیدگی و تجزیه
به همین ترتیب یک درخت افتاده درختان و تجزیه
در کف جنگل قرار دارد. به عبارت دیگر ،
صندلی Craft Sman یک سایت باز برای
آشکار کردن طبیعت. (Tabachnick 2004)
"
Tabachnick این فن آوری های قبلی را با برخی از آن مقایسه می کند
نماینده تحولات اخیر هستند ، "فناوری ها
که با طبیعت همکاری نمی کنند بلکه سعی در جایگزینی آن دارند ":
یک مهندس هسته ای می تواند ساختار را دستکاری کند
عناصر طبیعی برای تولید مصنوعی
عناصر به عنوان مثال ، پلوتونیوم به گونه ای طراحی شده است
هرگز از آن پیروی نکنید و به ویژگی های آن برنگردید
اورانیوم که از آن گرفته شده است. کاراکتر
Acter of Plutonium (به عنوان مثال ، سطح رادیواکتیویته آن)
همیشه مصنوعی است به همین ترتیب ، از نظر ژنتیکی
تغییر یافته انسان به گونه ای طراحی شده است که هرگز به
خصوصیات طبیعی ماده ای که از آن
مشتق شده بود (به عنوان مثال ، بدن بیمار یا ضعیف) و
بنابراین همیشه مصنوعی است. به نوبه خود ، معاصر

وجود
این یک روش برای بودن است ، نه ویژگی. می دانید ، داشتن تجهیزات خوب خوب است ، اما خیلی لعنتی
بد ، تجهیزات مورد نظر خود را دریافت کرده اید. زشت مکالمه است. این همه چیز است شما نمی توانید fi nd
در هر مکانی زشت در جهان به جز در دهان افراد. این یک استعاره است حالا من آن را خواهم گفت
با دقت شما نمی توانید به هیچ وجه زشت بلکه در زبان زدن باشید. و اگر به این موارد گوش می دهید
بعضی از قشرها ، پس شما واقعاً یک لاله هستید. این چیزهای سختی است که من در مورد آنها استفاده می کنم. "خوب نیست
خوب. " و "بی ارزش". من از کجا می روم "بی ارزش"؟
در گفتگو "بی ارزش".
درز
بله زیبا ببینید ، شما در مورد "بی ارزش" چیزی برای گفتن دارید. شما چیزی ندارید
در مورد احساسات خود بگویید شما نمی توانید چیزی احساس کنید اما آنچه را که احساس می کنید. شما چیزی ندارید
در مورد احساس خود بگویید. اما شما چیزی برای گفتن در مورد بی ارزش و زشت دارید. چون
بی ارزش و زشت یک مکالمه است ، این همه است. یکی مکالمه برای بی ارزش بودن است ، یا
یکی مکالمه برای زشت بودن است. و این به این امکان تبدیل می شود که در آن زندگی و
جهان و تصویر خود برای شما رخ می دهد. شما وقتی به آینه نگاه می کنید خود را نمی بینید. شما خود را مانند یک ، نمی بینید ، خود را مانند یک اتفاق می بینید. شما خود را به عنوان یک اتفاق می بینید
خود ، نه خود است. و آنچه در آینه رخ می دهد در آینه نیست. این در زبان زدن است ،
بنابراین ، شما به آنچه در آینه رخ می دهد دسترسی دارید: مانند مکالمه برای امکان
زیبا بودن این احمقانه است که می گویم "من زیبا هستم" ، به خصوص اگر نگاه کنید
مثل من شما شبیه او هستید ، شاید ، زیرا توافق نامه ای برای آن وجود دارد. من نگفتم راه می روم
در اطراف صحبت مثبت گفتم برای من امکان پذیر است که برای مکالمه درگیر شوم
امکان زیبا بودن من و شما و جهان در فضا اتفاق می افتد ، پاکسازی داده شده
توسط آن مکالمه برای امکان و اعمال من ، و احساسات من و افکار من یک خواهد بود
ارتباط با آن اتفاق می افتد. و اعمال من ، و احساسات من و افکار من روی
جهان شما این را می گیرید؟ جین
بله درز
و بنابراین شما چیزی برای گفتن در این مورد دارید. آنچه در مورد آن می گویید هیچ یک از مشاغل من نیست. این تجارت شماست ما می دانیم که چرا گفتی زشت و بی ارزش بودی ، زیرا
چیزی از آن ، درست است؟ برای بازپرداخت گفتگوی بازپرداخت را به خاطر می آورید؟ جین
بله درز
و خیلی زشت و بی ارزش یک راکت برای بازپرداخت بود. اما هیچ بازپرداختی برای این امکان وجود ندارد
زیبایی زیبایی به عنوان یک ادعا ، "من زیبا هستم" ، مانند توصیف خود ، مثل اینکه شما یک شی هستید ،
بازپرداخت در آن وجود دارد. اما هیچ بازپرداخت در امکان زیبایی وجود ندارد. در واقع آن
شما را بیشتر در معرض خطر قرار می دهد ، زیرا اکنون در معرض خطر زیبایی هستید. وقتی شما زشت هستید
مصنوعات فن آوری طبیعت را فاش نمی کنند. و ، زیرا در یک جامعه فناوری بسیار زیاد است
از دنیای ما پر از این "نامشخص است
مصنوعات ، "ما از آن جدا شده ایم ، بی خبر می شویم
از آن ، یا حرکت اساسی یا tran- را فراموش کنید
علوم وجود. (همانجا)
ما به خواننده یادآوری می کنیم که از یک جهانی حمایت نمی کنیم
بازگشت به مبلمان چوبی ؛ ما از پیشرفت های پزشکی پشیمان نیستیم
علمی که از مواد جدید استفاده می کند. برای انجام این کار Tantamount خواهد بود
به تظاهرات پیش از این در طول انجمن ، پیش از این
در روز چهارم ، بحث و گفتگو با کف. در عین حال ما نیستیم
بیان یک بیانیه اخلاقی در مورد آنچه که فن آوری است
درک وجود به انسان انجام شده است به گونه ای
البته ممکن است ما حتی بدون شک بپذیریم
پیشرفت های فنی کاملاً خطرناک. در اینجا ما به سادگی هستیم
با تمرکز بر این دیدگاه که ما در حال حاضر در یک فن آوری هستیم
از بودن در جهان ، و بنابراین ، آنچه مورد بحث است راه است
انسانی بودن که با این تحولات ظاهر شده است. یکی از روشهای اصلی انسان بودن که ظهور کرده است ، این است که
خود اورهارد در توسعه فناوری خود نمونه ای از آن آورده است
تحول: کارآفرینی. اصطلاح "کارآفرین"
برای انجام کارآفرینی از اصطلاح فرانسوی ناشی می شود. در
کارآفرین یک شرکت کننده است. به دور از پذیرش یا حتی تحمل
روشی که قبلاً وجود دارد ، کارآفرین پیش بینی و فاش می کند ،
از طریق نامگذاری اولیه ، امکانات جدیدی که راه را تغییر می دهد
جهان رخ می دهد. با زبان ما بر دنیای رخ داده تأثیر می گذاریم
و به تبع آن ، وجود ما ، برای وجود ما همیشه و در حال حاضر است
رقص با دنیای رخ داده. ما آنچه را می توان به وجود آورد
هرگز بدون اینکه گفته شود: ما صحبت می کنیم. رابطه با فناوری مدرن در کار در Erhard
فناوری تحول بلافاصله مربع نمی شود
شکایت مداوم هایدگر که روش فناوری ما را حفظ می کند
از اینکه ما را با خطر عمیق ارائه می دهد. تفاوت متفاوت است
ظریف ، و ما را ملزم به راه رفتن یک خط نازک همانطور که هر دو متفکر هستند
با این وجود در همان آبها ریخته می شود. به عنوان مثال ، اگر درک هایدگر را از آن تصور کنیم
روش فن آوری ما برای هماهنگی با هماهنگ بودن

روز چهارم انجمن: جلسه سه 503
نیازی به خطر زیاد نیست. لازم نیست وقتی زشت هستید خطوط خود را بیرون بیاورید. همه شما بیدار هستید؟ اگر زیبا هستید ، باید خطوط خود را بیرون بیاورید. شما می فهمید چرا؟ جین
بله درز
آیا ترولینگ را می فهمید؟ جین
بله (خنده)

دوباره امشب ، و من می خواهم شما بدانید که من از سهم شما در این مورد بسیار سپاسگزارم
انجمن. شما واقعاً زیبا هستید جین
ممنون او به تشویق طولانی از گروه نشست. Erhard به سمت تخته سنگ حرکت کرد و سه حلقه را کشید. اولین بار او را "داستان" و "چه
اتفاق افتاد. "
درز
به یاد داشته باشید در روز اول ، ما این دو محافل را ترسیم کردیم. یکی "داستان" شما و دیگری بود
دایره "چه اتفاقی افتاد" بود. بنابراین آنچه اتفاق افتاده است ، و داستان شما در مورد چه چیزی وجود داشت
اتفاق افتاد ، و سپس ما در مورد دایره شریر صحبت کردیم که در آن دو حوزه فرو ریختند ،
و شما نمی توانید تفاوت بین آنچه اتفاق افتاده و داستان شما در مورد آنچه اتفاق افتاده است بگویید. و شما فکر کردید که داستان شما در مورد آنچه اتفاق افتاده است اتفاق افتاده است. و این باعث می شود
مردم کافی است درست مثل قرار دادن دست خود بر روی اجاق گاز ، شما را از بین می برد. به همین دلیل شما
به روانشناسی نمی توان اعتماد کرد ، زیرا همه واقعیت های شناخته شده در روانشناسی تأسیس شده است
با آزمایش با موش و سوفورس های کالج ، که هیچ یک از آنها ممکن است انسانی نباشد - من
در مورد سوفورس های کالج نمی دانید ، اما من می دانم که موش ها مانند انسان نیستند. و
تفاوت بین یک موش و یک انسان یک موش در صورت دریافت ، خزیدن در فر را متوقف می کند
سوزانده شده ، و انسانها به داخل فر می ریزند. برای همیشه. چرا؟ زیرا "این درست است
اجاق گاز لعنتی ، و من به آن اعتقاد دارم. " و بعد ما پیشرفته تر شدیم و گفتیم دو نفر وجود دارد
قلمروهای وجود: آنچه وجود داشته است ، به عنوان یک حضور وجود داشته است ، و آنچه وجود داشت ، همان چیزها وجود دارد
به عنوان یک مفهوم این دو قلمرو مجزا از وجود ، حوزه های وجود است. مکانیسم خود "آنها" ، این دو متفکر در کنار هم ظاهر می شوند ،
اما این فقط یک ظاهر است. برای هایدگر ، یکی از موارد قابل توجه از
درک جهان به عنوان منبع منابع این است که انسان ها
نقش خود را به عنوان خودکشی با محوریت خود تسلیم کرده اند
موضوع از آنجا که Stand-Reserve یک "موضوع فراگیر" است ، ما را به حرکت در می آورد
فراتر از الگوی موضوعی و اوبات دکارتی که در آن آمده ایم
رابطه ما با چیزها را مفهوم سازی کنید. در عوض ، می گوید Dreyfus ، "ما هستیم
عبور از مرحله موضوعی-به مرحله ای که در آن فرهنگ
ممکن است بگوییم ، یک سیستم بزرگ سایبرنتیک "(" به دست آوردن "). به وضوح ، این غلبه بر ذهنیت دکارتی نیست که
هایدگر اولیه بودن و زمان و erhard - از آموزش EST تا
حال - در حال کار به سمت آن بوده ایم. این افتتاح جدید نیست
امکان بودن برای انسان. در عوض:
به محض اینکه دیگر غیرقانونی نیست
مربوط به انسان حتی به عنوان شیء است ، اما منحصراً
به عنوان ایستاده و انسان در میان
بی شیء چیزی جز سفارش دهنده نیست
با ایستادن ، سپس او به آستانه می آید
یک سقوط بسیار رسوب ، یعنی او به
نکته ای که خود او باید به عنوان
ایستاده- ("QCT" در BW 332 ، تأکید
اضافه شده)
"
این سقوط رسوب ، ما از قبل اتفاق افتاده است: این است
روش انسانی بودن در انجمن در شرکت کنندگان خود از
همان آغاز کسانی که به دنبال بهبود هستند ، برای به دست آوردن نکات
و تکنیک هایی برای غلبه و تغییر زندگی خود برای بهتر شدن ،
که هرگونه حکمت خرد را می گیرند و از آن استفاده می کنند ، بهتر است
آن را سفارش دهید ، اما در فرایند آنها - ما - واقعاً حقیقت را سرقت می کنیم ،
به عنوان غیرقابل انکار ، از قدرت خود- این راه خود بودن است
تخریب در برابر بزرگان هیچ چیز تحقیق از
تالار گفتگو به وجود می آید. محرمانه
و بنابراین ، ما به مرحله نهایی در نحوه فناوری مدرن می رسیم
جهان را آشکار می کند: "جوهر فناوری مدرن" ، می گوید
هایدگر ، "در Enframing [Gestell]" ("QCT" در BW 328) نهفته است. این
504
وجود
erhard (نشانگر دایره "داستان")
در این قلمرو مواردی مانند توضیحات وجود دارد. (نشانگر دایره "چه اتفاقی افتاده است")
و در این قلمرو مواردی مانند تجربه وجود دارد. بنابراین یکی تجربه و دیگری است
توضیح تجربه است. این کل داستان در زمانی بود که ما در مورد این موضوع بحث کردیم
زودتر ما به عقب می رفتیم. به صفر رسیدیم ، به خالی و بی معنی رسیدیم. در حال حاضر
ما می بینیم که دو طرف در انجمن وجود دارد. طرف اول "در حال حاضر چیست
همیشه از انسان بودن؟ " و طرف دیگر این است که "امکان وجود چیست
انسان؟ " اکنون شما شنیده اید "امکان بودن برای انسانها" به عنوان
شاید چیزی ، ممکن است من ، شاید باشم ، شاید ، مانند برخی از تصویر احمقانه ای که از خودت گرفتی
نازک و سکسی و جوان و ثروتمند ، یا هر تصور احمقانه شما برای خودتان است. مقدس این
در آنجا همان تله (نشانگر اولین دو حلقه)
این همان چیزی است که شما با آن متولد شده اید. این همان چیزی است که با بسته - آن دو حوزه. وجود دارد
دامنه دیگر (ترسیم دایره جدیدی به سمت چپ دایره "چه اتفاقی افتاده است")
با بسته همراه نیست. شما آن را به صورت رایگان دریافت نمی کنید. (نشانگر دایره "داستان")
شما می توانید در اینجا در مورد آن دامنه صحبت کنید ، اما این در مورد آن صحبت می کند. این مثل خوردن
منو (نشانگر سوم ، هنوز هم خالی از چپ دایره "چه اتفاقی افتاده" و "داستان" است
دایره)
بسیاری از افراد در مورد این دامنه صحبت می کنند. (نشانگر دایره "چه اتفاقی افتاده است")
شما حتی می توانید تجربیات آن را داشته باشید. افرادی که صرفاً تجربه آن را دارند عجیب می شوند. بخش
به هر حال ، افراد عجیب و غریب در این اتاق. آنها به کالیفرنیا گرایش می یابند. (خنده)
افرادی که تجربه آن دامنه دیگر را دارند: آنها را عجیب می کند. آنها نمی توانند از پس آن برآیند ، بنابراین آنها
عجیب بمان آنها هیچ تسلط بر دامنه ندارند. آنها در دامنه زندگی نمی کنند. آنها نمی آیند
از دامنه آنها در آن زندگی نمی کنند ، اما آنها آن را به صورت تجربی لمس کرده اند. همه در اتاق
این تجربه را داشته است همه برخی از شما به اندازه کافی از این تجربه برای عجیب بودن برخوردار نبوده اید
با این حال ، این همه شما آن تجربه را در جایی که لازم نیست غذا بخورید ، جایی که لازم نیست به آنجا بروید می دانید
حمام ، و شما خانه ندارید ، و چیزی جز آنچه انجام می دهید وجود ندارد. شما حتی نیستید
آنجا ، درست است؟ مثل این است که وقتی از راه خارج می شوید ، و اتفاق می افتد وقتی خارج می شوید
از راه؟ راستی ، کی برمی گردید؟ وقتی بد شد بلافاصله شما در آنجا حق دارید:
"اوه گه!"
اوج ، جمع آوری چالش برانگیز و
سفارش ، جعبه ای که در آن انسان به عنوان منابع در حال حاضر است
خود را در این مقطع در تاریخ ما پیدا کنید. برای استخدام
بومی ، روش فن آوری بودن یک معامله انجام شده است: "
تهدید واقعی در حال حاضر انسان را در ذات خود قرار داده است. بشر بشر بشر بنابراین
سوال در مورد چگونگی رسیدن به یک رابطه با ذات
از فناوری ، از این طریق سؤال می شود ، همیشه خیلی دیر می شود "(" QCT "در
BW 333 ، 329). در مصاحبه ای در سال 1966 با خبرنامه آلمان
der spiegel ، پرسید که چه چیزی در جهان مفقود شده است ، چه زمانی ، همه ،
به نظر می رسید همه چیز در حال کار است و تولید در یک بود
هایدگر پاسخ داد: "همه چیز در حال کار است. این دقیقاً است
آنچه آنقدر غیرقانونی است ، که همه چیز در حال کار است و
عملکرد بیشتر و بیشتر ما را به سمت عملکرد بیشتر سوق می دهد ،
و این فناوری مردان را از زمین شل می کند و از بین می رود
آنها "(در تقابل هایدگر زیمرمن با مدرنیته
199 ، تأکید اضافه شده است). Dreyfus ، انسان می گوید ، بنابراین از بین رفت.
موجودات "به منبعی تبدیل می شوند که مورد استفاده قرار می گیرد و مهمتر از همه
پیشرفته ، مانند هر منبع دیگری "(" به دست آوردن "). و با این حال ، این فناوری تحول Erhard است که به ارمغان می آورد
شرکت کنندگان خود را برای رسیدن به چنین رابطه ای با ذات انجام دهند
از فناوری ، درست در میان پاره شدن از زمین ،
به عنوان هر منبع مورد استفاده و تقویت شده ، گرفتار شده در
منطق بی امان از سفارش داخلی. به جای اینکه از
روش فن آوری بودن ما به عنوان سؤال از
انجمن شرکت کنندگان خود را راهنمایی می کند تا با آن چهره به چهره بیایند ،
تا آن ، در دام باشد که برای انسان است. ■
