Forum Day Two: Session Two

LOUISE (continuing to object)t
Apes and dogs have language. So do rocks.
ERHARD
If everything’s got language there’s nothing to talk about, because nothing’s distinguished.
LOUISE
They are diff erent languages.
ERHARD
You’re making yourself stupid. You’re a fucking Californian. It’s that hundredth monkey shit.
You denigrate the great mysteries when you turn them into crap. Apes don’t have language. It’s
true that apes signal. But they don’t communicate. Rocks bump into each other, and animals
have a fancy form of bumping. But animals don’t have language, they have signals. Whatever it
is we’re distinguishing with the word language, it’s what human beings do. Apes don’t dwell in
possibility. To dwell in possibility you’ve got to have what I call language. I’m asserting some-
thing, and you can’t prove an assertion. You can disprove an assertion but you can’t prove it.
You can validate an assertion, and there’s a lot of evidence for that one. You can move without
language. Rocks move all the time. One distinguishes by an operation in language in which pos-
sibility is generated. And it’s generated by speaking and listening, and by what’s present without
being said by virtue of what is said. Let me give you an example.
(addressing The Forum Supervisor)r
Julie, give me some water please? She doesn’t come up and throw a bucket of water on me.
(to the group)
Where the hell is “in a bucket” or “in a glass”? It’s not in your brain. It’s in the conversation.
One of the possibilities in the domain of possibility called language is possibility itself. Two was
distinguished in the conversation we had for distinguishing distinction.
(moving to the chalkboard and drawing a series of marks)
Is this two?
LOUISE
It’s two.
(grouping the marks with two enclosing outlines)
Now it occurs as two. Two is there if you’ve got the possibility “two.” There’s an infi nite number
of ways to make that “two.”
LOUISE
But how do you do it?
ERHARD
It arises in language. Do you know how to ride a bicycle?

SPEAKING BEING
LOUISE
Yes.
ERHARD
How did you learn?
LOUISE
Just started to go and then discovered that my dad was not behind me.
ERHARD
That’s the story they say. But let me tell you how it happened. When you fi rst sit on a bicycle
all the sensations are the same. They all feel the same: they’re all falling. At some point some
sensations are falling and other sensations are not. They’re the same sensations you had when
you fi rst sat on the bicycle, but now some of them occur as falling and some as not falling. That
happens when the distinction balance is distinguished as a possibility. Now your father told
you, “you’ve got to balance. And balance is up like this.” That didn’t help. It all still felt like
falling. When the distinction balance is distinguished—not conceptualized—then some of the
sensations start to occur as balance, as not falling.
(pausing

There are no twelve easy steps to distinguishing. If you’re willing to engage in the conversation
there’s a possibility of distinguishing there. Distinction arises in the conversation. You just can’t
see conversation. Very useful conversation. Thank you.

When you said “I promise,” a promise falls out of your mouth; if I had listened to you promise
twenty times and not keep your promise, then when you said the word “promise,” a promise
wouldn’t fall out of your mouth, just the word “promise” would.
ERHARD
Yeah. If you don’t keep your promise repeatedly, you create a no-possibility listening for promis-
ing, so that what falls out of your mouth is the word. So the possibility lives in the conversation.

So the sacredness of a promise can only live in a conversation.
ERHARD
Yeah. And one of the things that fucks it up brutally is that bullshit about sincerity. Disgusting.
We’ll get to that before The Forum is over.

The other thing. When I say I hate you, what could fall out of my mouth is hate or...
