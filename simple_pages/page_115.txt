Forum Day Two: Session One 
101
ERHARD
This is a room full of highly accomplished people. And you know accomplished people?
MIKE
Sure.
ERHARD
And they are not necessarily profoundly satisfi ed, are they?
MIKE
No they’re not.
ERHARD
And they’re not full of joy.
MIKE
No they’re not.
ERHARD
There’s something wrong there. When people see that, like you and me, we start to come up 
with these stupid conclusions. “Well, life isn’t worth it after all. You get all this stuff  done and
so what?” “Is that all there is? I got to be the president of the company,” or “I raised a wonderful 
family. Success is shit. Do what you want.” People give up accomplishment: all these weird solu-
tions. Accomplishment doesn’t work for people because they do it in order not to be something. 
Clear?
MIKE
I get the theory.
ERHARD
Once you get what you call the theory, you want to stand in that theory and look at life. People
who get married in order to not be lonely, even when they are successful in the marriage, sim-
ply end up being not lonely, while still being attached to “lonely.” This whole big possibility of 
being married or being related, they’re not there. They’re in “lonely.” Clear?
MIKE
That part is clear.
ERHARD
Which part isn’t clear?
MIKE
I’m just trying to digest everything.
NOTE: This is a “hint” toward the conversation near the end 
of Day Three called “There’s something wrong here.”
