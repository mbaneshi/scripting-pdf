Forum Day Two: Session One
101
ERHARD
This is a room full of highly accomplished people. And you know accomplished people?
MIKE
Sure.
ERHARD
And they are not necessarily profoundly satisfi ed, are they?
MIKE
No they’re not.
ERHARD
And they’re not full of joy.
MIKE
No they’re not.
ERHARD
There’s something wrong there. When people see that, like you and me, we start to come up
with these stupid conclusions. “Well, life isn’t worth it after all. You get all this stuff  done and
so what?” “Is that all there is? I got to be the president of the company,” or “I raised a wonderful
family. Success is shit. Do what you want.” People give up accomplishment: all these weird solu-
tions. Accomplishment doesn’t work for people because they do it in order not to be something.
Clear?
MIKE
I get the theory.
ERHARD
Once you get what you call the theory, you want to stand in that theory and look at life. People
who get married in order to not be lonely, even when they are successful in the marriage, sim-
ply end up being not lonely, while still being attached to “lonely.” This whole big possibility of
being married or being related, they’re not there. They’re in “lonely.” Clear?
MIKE
That part is clear.
ERHARD
Which part isn’t clear?
MIKE
I’m just trying to digest everything.
NOTE: This is a “hint” toward the conversation near the end
of Day Three called “There’s something wrong here.”

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Don’t try to digest everything. What I want you to do is stand in it and look out in life.
MIKE
How do I do that?
ERHARD
Tell me how to walk. And then I’ll tell you how to do that.
MIKE
Lean forward.
ERHARD
Tell me how to lean forward.
MIKE
Bend your back.
ERHARD
Tell me how to bend my back.
(silence)
The truth is, you don’t know how to walk. You walk, but you don’t know how to walk. You
don’t walk out of “knowing how.” Even if you studied anatomy and knew every single muscle I
needed to use, and understood the operation of all the parts of the body, and all the neural path-
ways impulses had to be sent down, you wouldn’t know how to generate them in the fi rst place,
besides which, you couldn’t keep all that in mind to lift one leg up, let alone to walk, right? The
fact is you don’t know how to walk. You just walk.
MIKE
I guess I never looked at it from that point of view.
ERHARD
You never looked at it from that point of view. You don’t need to guess about it. Who you are is
an “I guess.” You don’t know how to walk, do you?
MIKE
I can walk.
ERHARD
Yes. That’s not in discussion.
