SPEAKING BEING
KEVIN
I felt like I discovered something I didn’t know before.
WES (pointing to his mouth)
This is where the breakthrough happens. Right here.
ERHARD (coming forward)
Wait a second, this is something we need to handle here. Kevin, did you know that you are
stingy?
KEVIN
Well, that’s kind of a surprise.
ERHARD
I want you to wake up to that. You are stingy, my friend. You think you’re precise and careful,
but you’re actually stingy. You mistake precision and care—which are laudable—for being
stingy. You’re ungenerous. Not big. It does not enroll people into your view. It alienates people.
They don’t fuck with you because you’re too careful and precise. But they don’t like you. It’s
unattractive and it disempowers you. You’ve probably got something to give, but nobody will
get it from you. People won’t “get” from stingy people. I don’t require that you discuss that with
me.
KEVIN
I don’t mind discussing it with you, I just can’t really fi nd in my mind where I’m stingy because
I don’t think that other people feel that I’m stingy. I’ve got other problems, but I’m searching to
fi nd where I’m stingy and I don’t see it.
ERHARD
And that’s what I want you to do. I want you to stay in the question tonight about being stingy.
Are you married?
KEVIN
Yes.
ERHARD
Ask your wife.
(laughter)
I don’t mean stingy with money. I mean stingy with forwarding the action, stingy with
contributing aliveness, stingy with empowerment. Ask your wife, or ask the people that work
for you. Okay, please go on. I don’t mean to cut you off  on that, I just think that it’s more useful
for you to take a look at it overnight, and if you’re wanting to discuss it further I am willing to
do that tomorrow. Is that all right with you?
Forum Day Three: Session Four
279
KEVIN
Sure.
ERHARD
Thanks.
KEVIN
Where was I? I was going to share my breakthrough.
ERHARD
You were going to share your “guess” breakthrough.
KEVIN
Now I’m not even sure what a breakthrough is. In any case, I feel like something happened. I
don’t know.
WES
I don’t want to hear that. You’re either going to say there was a breakthrough, or you’re going to
say there wasn’t a breakthrough. But there’s no guessing. There’s no maybe. There’s no place to
look.
KEVIN
I had a breakthrough because something new and diff erent was happening to me that I hadn’t
experienced before.
WES
No, you had a breakthrough because you say so.
ERHARD
Kevin, breakthrough is a declaration phenomenon. Do you know the meaning of assertion? The
commonplace meaning of assertion?
KEVIN
Yes.
ERHARD.
Breakthrough is not an assertion.
KEVIN
Okay.
ERHARD
It’s a declaration.
280
SPEAKING BEING
KEVIN
Okay.
ERHARD
It’s a stand one takes in the matter. That’s what Wes is discussing with you, to put it in more
technical language.
KEVIN
Okay.
ERHARD
That’s what he means when he says “It’s whatever you say it is.”
KEVIN
Okay.
ERHARD
Like a declaration.
KEVIN.
My breakthrough was my racket, fi nding my racket, which was standing right in front of me all
the time, was that I have to do everything: Every goddamned thing in the world for everybody. I
even have to run this Forum for you.
(laughter)
Now there’s going to be some people laughing, but as The Forum went along, I realized that I
was running The Forum because The Forum wasn’t working out the right way for me, so I was
having to make adjustments in The Forum so it was working out right for me. And so I made
those adjustments. When I wanted to go to the bathroom, I went to the bathroom. And I tried to
come on time, but I was late a couple of times, so I guess that means that I didn’t really try.
WES
No it means you were late.
KEVIN (laughing)
Sorry I said that.
ERHARD
You did try.
KEVIN
Okay. I have to do everything because everybody around me is ineff ective. And I am very good
at it. I can do anything. Fix this, make sure everything gets done, and I can’t let anybody do
anything for me. And I was aware of this, but I never saw this was such a dominant feature of
my life as I did until today. At that point it leaves my mind blank.
Forum Day Three: Session Four
281
ERHARD
Kevin, what was the last thing you just said?
KEVIN
I’m afraid to repeat anything I said you might have found interesting.
(laughter)
No, I said “At that point it leaves my mind blank.”
ERHARD
Got it.
WES
Let me give you some way to look at...
ERHARD
By the way, you’re not afraid of me, you’re afraid of looking bad.
KEVIN
I’m not afraid of you...
ERHARD
That’s right. You’re afraid of looking bad.
KEVIN
I’m a little bit afraid of you.
(laughter)
ERHARD
I’m going to leave you with that delusion.
(laughter)
WES
Inside of what you’ve said, I’ll give you another way of looking at it, or an aspect of it--
something to hang out with tonight along with Werner’s comment about your stinginess: you’ve
been resisting being in a coaching conversation.
KEVIN
Yes.
282
SPEAKING BEING
WES
You’re going to do it your way. Now you’re not the only one in this room that’s going to do it his
way or her way. That’s human being. And that’s the absurdity of human being. Because you’ve
done it all your way and it took you to where you are now—no, sorry—it took you to where you
were before The Forum. So if you tell the truth now about where you were before The Forum,
you’ll see the eff ectiveness of doing life your way. The planet is full of people doing life their
way.
KEVIN
But I’ve done it more so than anybody else in this room.
WES
Always.
KEVIN
No, I’m dead sure of that. See I have evidence. There’s only a few people here who wouldn’t
allow themselves to be taped. And I’ve already talked to the other people. I didn’t seek them out
after that stupid incident here. And I’m getting blocked here.
WES
You’re doing great. You’re actually getting off  it. If I hear you right: you’re willing to tell one on
yourself, right?
KEVIN
Yeah.
WES
A person who resists a coaching conversation never gets coached. That’s
got its...
KEVIN
You’re a great coach but, excuse me, I’ll... I’ll only take from you whatever I’m going to take.
Everything comes through some sort of fi lter, and I only take whatever I think is okay for me,
and the rest of it I think, for the most part you’re on the ball, but where you’re a little screwed
up there, I’m not going to accept that.
WES
Right, of course. I’m not saying “believe everything.” That’s not the other side of what I’m
saying. But it’s not going along with it. We’re talking about a coaching conversation.
KEVIN
It’s all right. I won’t let myself. I’m afraid to put myself in the hands of somebody else
completely. Trust somebody completely.
Forum Day Three: Session Four
283
WES
Okay.
KEVIN
I always have to back it up, in every way I can, so that if they screw up I’ll have a way to get
myself out of the situation.
WES (shifting back and forth)
Yeah. So you’re like this. One foot kinda in, one foot kinda out? In coaching, right?
KEVIN
Professionally I’ve been very eff ective. Been very successful. So why am I here, well because this
doesn’t work in other aspects of my life.
WES
It may not even work in the area you think it does work.
KEVIN
Well I think there’s certain objective evidence there that...
WES
Oh, I know you’re successful and all that stuff , but you have no idea of what could have been
possible.
KEVIN
Oh yeah, I agree, now, looking back, I can see what I could have done better, if I...
WES
Yeah, not even taking into account who you could be in life.
KEVIN
Right.
WES
Rather than just successful, but who you could be.
(to the group)
Kevin’s sharing something powerful in telling one on himself. Remember: people resist being
coached, so we’re not really open to other people’s contribution. And to the degree you do that
you miss the contribution that’s available. Now you can start to see that. You’ll always come up
with a story that justifi es it; there’s always a story that justifi es it: “I didn’t like this”; “they’re
selling me this”; “they said that”; etc. That’s human being.
KEVIN
Oh, I’ve got a lot of those stories.
284
SPEAKING BEING
WES
And there’s another possibility outside the story. And what you got to do to step into it is like
you’re saying, “surrender into something.” I don’t like the word... give something up to get in
there. To be a willingness to be contributed to, to be generous, to be big, to forward the action...
KEVIN
I feel like I need to risk something.
WES
Yes.
KEVIN
And a... I’m going to have to risk something that is really, really important to me, and I’m not
even sure what that’s going to be at this point. That’s going to be really tough. That’s going to be
real tough because I don’t risk anything.
KIPP
Keeping yourself that closed up, that’s what’s been tough. Couldn’t be any tougher than you are
doing now.
KEVIN
Well, I don’t think I have a story beyond that.
WES
Here’s what I’m asking. Look at this conversation about being generous, about being big, about
being coachable, look at this thing about what you’re willing to risk. Tonight. And come back
and share it tomorrow.
KEVIN
Okay.
KIPP
What is this thing you have about being video- taped?
KEVIN
Well, I’m really surprised that more people don’t want to be videotaped. I don’t trust you. I’m
not willing to be videotaped because I don’t trust the organization, WE & A. Because I think
you’ll fuck it up, one way or the other. And once it’s on tape, there it is, there’s a lot that you can
do with it. A lot can happen to it. I lose control of it. So I don’t want to lose control again. So I
don’t see why I should be videotaped, that’s for your benefi t. It’s not helping me. I came here to
help me.
KIPP
And to be clear I am not advocating that you should be videotaped. Just between you and me I
couldn’t quite get what it was all about. So I needn’t fi nd out.
Waiting for the Leap
Central to a dialogue for the presencing of Being, says Heidegger,
is the abandonment of a “thirst for knowledge and greed for
explanations”; we must, instead, be willing to wait, and to “abide
in hope before what is worthy of thought” (“DL” in OWL 13).
Therefore it is of interest that, at one point in his dialogue with the
Japanese scholar, even Heidegger expresses impatience with his
partner’s enigmatic hesitation: “I shall not hide from you that you
are throwing me into a state of great agitation,” says Heidegger,
“especially because all my eff orts to get an answer to my question
from language experts and linguistic scholars of language have so
far been in vain” (“DL” in OWL 28).
Heidegger’s agitation may give comfort to those of us who,
thrown to the eff icient formulation of definitions and concepts,
nevertheless aspire to true philosophic dialogue—conversations
that in the vernacular allow for “deep thinking.” Such dialogue,
which thinks its way into the unknown and trusts the dialogue
itself to find a way out, is a challenging undertaking, especially as a
form of pedagogical inquiry.
The balance of mutuality and directedness in ontological
dialogue is one of the distinctions developed in the unspoken
background of The Forum, and of this book.
The intention that generates ontological dialogue is the
thinking of the unthought, and ultimately the unthinkable.
Paradoxically, such thinking occurs both slowly and suddenly. As
Werner Erhard has put it, you don’t get it and you don’t get it and
Forum Day Three: Session Four
285
KEVIN
What the reaction was all about?
KIPP
No, exactly what you said, that you didn’t trust. The way you got trust, trust isn’t available. Trust
to you is accounting.
KEVIN
Right.
KIPP
So when you’re bored, you get this big accounting sheet with everybody’s name on it.
Kipp did an entertaining demonstration of Kevin’s view of trust: as a matter of accounting, using a
list he carried with him crossing people off  whom he did not trust.
KIPP (continuing)
And you walk down the path of life, with your little pad with everybody’s name on it, and “you
remember twelve years ago we were working on that thing, I wanted to do that thing, but you
got to and I didn’t?”
(crossing off  that person’s name on an imagined  list)
“Seventeen years ago, that company picnic, you walked over to the boss and started talking to
him? And he stopped talking to me?”
(crossing off  another person’s name; pointing at another person)
“You didn’t do anything but someone with a beard like that did.”
(crossing yet another name off  the list, to laughter)
That’s what you call trust.
KEVIN
But my list is way longer.
KIPP
There’s no trust there, just adding up and keeping track.
KEVIN
That’s right.
KIPP
Trust. I’m inviting you to consider that maybe, trust is simply, “I trust you.”
you don’t get it—for a long time—and then you get it, all at once.
This is the moment of insight that Heidegger calls Augenblick—a
moment of vision—and he says it occurs as a leap:
“
There is no bridge here—only the leap. [. . .]
The leap alone takes us into the neighborhood
where thinking resides. [. . .] In contrast to a
steady progress, where we move unawares
from one thing to the next and everything
remains alike, the leap takes us abruptly to
where everything is diff erent, so diff erent
that it strikes us as strange. [. . .] Though we
may not founder in such a leap, what the leap
takes us to will confound us. (WCT 8, 12)
T
On the other hand, he cautions:
“
Leap and vision require long, slow preparation. . . .
(WCT 233)
T
Nobody can in just one single leap take dis-
tance from the predominant circle of ideas, es-
pecially not if he is dealing with the well-worn
tracks of traditional thinking—tracks that fade
into realms where they can hardly be seen.
(“DL” in OWL 36)
Only one who takes the right running start can
leap. Everything is decided by this run, for it
means that we ourselves actually ask the ques-
tions again, and that we, in these questions,
first create the perspectives. (IM 196)
M
Yet it is important to remember, again, that while we are on the
way to language and thinking, we are always within language and
thinking. Therefore the paradox and reflexivity continues, once we
have made that leap:
286
SPEAKING BEING
KEVIN
But I don’t.
KIPP
That’s right. I didn’t say to. I’m not manipulating you into trusting. I’m not advocating it...
ERHARD
He’s not going to get that because he still doesn’t get the distinction between assertion and
declaration. Kevin, did you know that you did your whole number in your response to Kipp?
You did “stingy”; you did “don’t risk”; you did “nobody does it right.”
KEVIN
Yeah.
ERHARD
Like counting down. That was totally automatic.
KEVIN
Yeah.
ERHARD
Not one thing you said had a shred of intelligence in it. I want you to listen to what I’m saying.
It was not an expression of your intelligence. It was not an expression of your common sense. It
was an expression of your act—limited completely to your act. You had no choice in the matter.
It was not some product of an intelligent choice or a commonsensical choice.
KEVIN
I’ll accept that.
WES
So you got the assignment?
KEVIN
Yes.
WES
I just want to acknowledge your willingness to be in this conversation.
KEVIN
I just wanted to say to everyone else in the auditorium, that I’m safe to be around. It’s not
that bad.
“
And where have we leapt? Perhaps into an
abyss? No! Rather, onto some firm soil. Some?
No! But on that soil upon which we live and
die, if we are honest with ourselves. A curious,
indeed unearthly thing that we must first leap
onto the soil on which we really stand. (WCT 41,
T
emphasis added)
In distinguishing the leap, Heidegger continues the reflexivity that
characterizes his thought: we leap to where we already are.
In Being and Time, he says that Dasein “is existentially that
which, in its potentiality-for-Being, it is not yet. . . .  [O] nly because
it is what it becomes (or alternatively, does not become), can it say
to itself ‘Become what you are’ and say this with understanding”
(BT 185–186). Scholar Joan Stambaugh calls this movement of
thinking an “ongoing reaching that belongs to what it reaches”
(ID 14).
As we have noted elsewhere, such reflexivity is central to the
thinking of Zen, as Erhard has observed: “In Zen, one is working
toward enlightenment from and in a context of already being
enlightened” (Bartley 125). ■
Forum Day Three: Session Four
287
(applause)
At this point Jane raised her hand. When she stood, her appearance was strikingly diff erent, and the
participants applauded.
ERHARD (to Jane)
Do you know what they’re clapping about?
JANE
No.
(laughter)
ERHARD
People don’t clap for ugly worthless people, do they?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
So you know what they’re clapping about?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
They’re clapping in part due to your attractiveness, which comes from your being a big,
generous person.
JANE
Hmm hhmmm.
(laughter)
ERHARD
You got that didn’t you? You’ve been big and generous in our conversations, haven’t you?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Good. Nothing to be embarrassed about there. Nothing to be caught in. They’re also clapping for
another kind of generosity and that’s the generosity that they think they see and that I think I see in
your beginning to get off  it. Like getting off  your act about being worthless. All those other things.
288
SPEAKING BEING
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
You think you’re getting off  that? Being ugly and worthless?
JANE
In some ways, but it’ll probably still be with me.
ERHARD
You’re saying that you’re getting off  it but that in some ways it’ll probably still be with you?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Couple things. First off , there’s the diff erence between apes and you and me: you and me
have “probablys.” The ape doesn’t have any probablys, because the ape doesn’t have—listen
up here—don’t get sucked in by her attractiveness...
(laughter)
The ape doesn’t have any “probablys” because the ape doesn’t have any language. Only you
and I have probablys. And we invent those probablys with our mouths. We don’t know that. We
think we’re inventing probablys by extrapolating the past into the future. You understand the
word “extrapolate”?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
Extending the past into the future? You know you take a line that goes like this...
(drawing a line in the air)
And then it goes like that. You’re extending the line from the past into the future.
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
So, you and I think that we say probably based on this mental operation called extending the
past into the future. And that’s why you said “probably” to me, is it not?
Forum Day Three: Session Four
289
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Because given your past you’re probably not going to get off  it entirely, are you?
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
And that’s sensible and intelligent dealing with the future as an extension of the past. Did you
follow what I said?
JANE
A little.
ERHARD
When you said “I probably wouldn’t get off  it entirely,” I said that was an intelligent, sensible
extension of your past into the future.
JANE
Okay.
ERHARD
Good. Now there’s a particular discussion I want to have with you now. Our previous
discussions have been for your benefi t. This one I’m having for the benefi t of the group. I think
you have something to contribute here; that you will be an example that will illustrate what I
want people to be able to see as powerfully as anybody else in The Forum could illustrate it. I
want to be straight with you and tell you that so that I can fi nd out if you’re willing to have this
discussion with me. And you won’t know what that discussion is; you’ll have to take a chance.
I’m not saying you won’t get any value out of it, because you may. I suspect you will. Probably.
(Jane smiles)
Anybody see her smile like that before? Okay, so, you with me? Ready to do this?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Earlier we talked about when you were four, fi ve, or six, and what it looked like for someone
of that age for your mother to be taken away... you get that it would look that way for a child
that age, that “my mother left me, or abandoned me, or she was taken away”? By the way, it
doesn’t make any diff erence that she can’t remember that. Remember you told me you couldn’t
remember that very clearly? But we know it happened and that somebody either told you or you
fi gured it out. It’s not something you remember directly, right?
290
SPEAKING BEING
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Right. That’s there more powerfully than what she remembers. Is there anybody who doesn’t
understand what I just said? Stand up.
(a participant standing up)
I said, what’s there when it’s not recognized—I hate this word but I’m going to use it because
it’s getting late and I want people to understand—what’s there and unconscious is there more
powerfully in terms of its ability to shape your behavior and your feelings and thoughts than
what’s there and is conscious. You got that?
PARTICIPANT
Yeah, I got it.
ERHARD
Okay, so that’s there whether she remembers it or not. And then there was this woman who
came in and broke the bond, which was your haven, with your father.
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
Good. And I said that... I fi rst asked if you made any decisions. You remember that?
(many participants replying “yes”)
Whatever it was, she made some decision. And I said this was a critical point, this was
something that everybody’s got to get. I said: “we talk about it like ‘I decided,’ and maybe you
did, but what really happened is that you became huh huh huh huh huh... You became that
‘I’m worthless.’ It’s not merely ‘I decided.’ That’s not forceful enough. It’s: you became ‘I’m
worthless.’” You remember that, vaguely?
JANE
A little.
ERHARD
Okay, good.
ERHARD (to the group)
You remember that?
Forum Day Three: Session Four
291
(many responding “yes”)
Remember I said “you become something.” You are worthless. Or to say it with a little bit more
rigor: You now are that you are worthless. Everybody got that? Anybody didn’t get that? Okay
good. Now what we’re going to look at is where did all this mess get generated? Why would
anybody be stupid enough to generate the kind of mess you got? Anybody not clear there’s a
mess here? Do we need to get more mess up for you? Everybody’s got a mess. People in here
are in good shape to start with, and still we’ve got a mess. Can you imagine what it would be
like for somebody who is in bad shape? We screen out people who are in bad shape. We only
let people in here who are in good shape. Most people who have participated in our programs
are above average in their adjustment to life; they are able to handle life on average. What we’re
going to look at here is where did this mess come from?
(pausing)
Now you’ve got to get back to where Jane was. I said I want you to be standing in being a
four-, fi ve-, six-year-old and I want you to tell me—I want to know-what it looked like from
there. So you want to get there in order to get this. You’ve got to be a little girl whose mother
is gone. Either abandoned her or taken away from her, whose only place of belonging is in her
relationship with her father. And that bond that represents for her the only place of belonging,
which represents for her “home”—I don’t mean a building with a family in it—I mean a home,
like being home, home. Being home, home. And that bond, which represents being home: home
is broken. And so what do you suppose you decide when that happens? You got any idea what
you decided when things got to be that rotten?
JANE
I think I decided not to love her and ignore her.
ERHARD
Yeah. Very good. And you’ve been working over on top of that trying to be good about, trying to
love her and trying to respect her? Yes?
JANE
Yes. But I can’t do it.
ERHARD
Yeah. That’s what you decided about the situation. What did you decide about life? Can you
remember? Take a look.
JANE
I would try to outdo her so my dad would like me more than her.
ERHARD
Yeah. That’s great. So that’s looking into the situation. You decided that about the situation with
your stepmom. What I want to know and what I want you to look at Jane is if you can see what
you decided about life itself. Take a look and see what you decided about life itself.
292
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (to the group)
And what you want to be doing is being a four-, fi ve-, six-year-old girl whose mother was taken
away or abandoned her and whose only place of belonging, her only place to be, like be at
home, was her father and that just got smashed. What did you decide about life? You see, you
made all those decisions like she made about herself and about her stepmother, and about how
she was gonna deal with her stepmother, and all that stuff . What I want to know now is what
you decided about life.
(to a participant with raised hand)
I don’t want an answer; I want you to think.
(indicating Jane)
She’ll answer: you think.
(to Jane)
Remember what you decided about life? “I decided...”
JANE
Not to be worthless.
ERHARD
You mean, try to overcome being worthless.
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
That’s what you decided about yourself. What did you decide about life?
JANE
I don’t know.
ERHARD
Okay good.
(to the group)
So I’m going to tell you what you decided about life, because you’ve got one of those. You may
have been three when you made that decision, or ten, or eleven, or twelve, but everybody in the
room made the same decision in some circumstance similar to that which Jane just described.
The only obvious decision such a child could possibly make... And that decision is there is
something wrong here. Where? Where is there something wrong? Not you. That’s the part you
already told us about. There’s something wrong here: in life! There’s something wrong here.
Something is off . There’s something wrong! Can you see that would be an inevitable conclusion
for some eleven-on-down-year-old person? You think about it for a second. If I get you as a
A Violent Way
“The word ‘way,’” says Heidegger, “probably is an ancient primary
word that speaks to the reflective mind of man” (“NL” in OWL 92).
The central notion behind Heidegger’s use of “way” to designate
his process of thinking calls for action and vigilance to maintain
ground gained:
“
To clear a way, for instance across a snow-cov-
ered field, is in the Alemannic-Swabian dialect
still called wëgen even today. This verb, used
transitively, means: to form a way and, forming
it, to keep it ready. Way-making understood in
this sense no longer means to move something
up and down a path which is already there. It
means to bring the way. . . forth first of all, and
thus to be the way. (“WL” in OWL 129–30)

293
big, tough, mature, intelligent adult, and I get you into a bad enough set of circumstances, you
ever remember saying to yourself, “life is fucked”? You see how easy that conclusion is for a
three-year-old, four-year-old, fi ve-year-old? What would it take to come to that conclusion for a
three-, four-, or fi ve-year-old? Nobody comes to your party. Your mother’s mean to you. Almost
anything, right? Real easy, right? Not only easy, it’s inevitable. And it’s not merely inevitable
circumstantially. I’m not going to demonstrate this part to you, I’m just going to tell you. So
I’m not asking you to accept it or believe it: It’s the already always being of human beings—
that there is something wrong. If you’re a human being, you are that there’s something wrong
waiting to happen. Now forget that, because I’m not going to give you enough evidence of
that to make it clear. But I just want you to hear it. What I want you to get is that it’s inevitable
circumstantially. When you were growing up you had a circumstance in which the inevitable
conclusion was, would have to be, “there is something wrong here!” There’s something wrong
innately, profoundly, deeply, at the foundation, there’s something wrong! Life is constituted—
you don’t think in these terms, but—life is constituted as something wrong. Something’s wrong!
And you don’t make that decision. You are that there’s something wrong. Now, you don’t get
that yet; you’re not supposed to get that yet. You’re supposed to follow what I’m saying.
(posturing as the voice in a participant’s “head”)
“Gee, I don’t know. I don’t think that I’m ‘that there’s something wrong.’ I see what you’re saying
Werner, I see that it’s logical that I would have to have come to that conclusion in my childhood,
like a way of being. But gee I don’t get that ‘there’s something wrong.’ I mean, I actually think
there’s a lot of right things. I mean, I don’t live my life out of ‘there’s something wrong.’”
(returning to his own voice)
That’s what you should be saying to yourself, unless it’s already obvious to you that who you are
is that there’s something wrong. For most of you that won’t be obvious yet. What I said will be
obvious: that there is in your childhood and in your early childhood the circumstances in which
you as a child would have to come to the inevitable conclusion that there is something wrong
in life. That part I know you can see. The part you can’t see yet is how to fi t that into today. So
we’re going to fi t that into today for you now. Jane, so, what I said made sense? Like you decided
there was something wrong?
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
You answered the question I asked: Did it make sense?
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
You got any recollection of having made that kind of decision?
One is the way oneself, since until one advances there is no way.
This perspective of his own work emerged early on in
Heidegger’s career as a professor of philosophy. Here he describes
his development of this perspective, as it occurred for him during a
course he taught early in his career:
“
. . . the course was most imperfect. Yet there
was quickening in it the attempt to walk a path
of which I did not know where it would lead.
I knew only the most immediate short-range
perspectives along that path, because they
beckoned to me unceasingly, while the horizon
shift ed and darkened more than once.
(“DL” in OWL 6)
This is the first of three points that we want to stress here about
Heidegger’s way: that in entering upon the way to Being, one
is jumping off  into the unknown. This is necessary because the
thinking of Being cannot be understood in advance of its being
thought. Therefore its undertaking is necessarily an advance into
what is not known. But it is important to note that this advance
into the unknown is not simply thinking about some thought
content which we do not yet understand, something that we
know we don’t know. That would be equivalent to examining new
territory using a map; but Heidegger has no map. Werner Erhard
has made this point about his own work: in such thinking, we are
not merely traveling in uncharted waters, but in water that does
not always act like water (“Heart of the Matter”).
This is an important point for Heidegger: to be on the
way we must free ourselves from our subservience to the
“common comprehension,” which is “convinced it was born
comprehending everything” (WCT 77). We must give up judging
each new thought on the basis of whether it is consistent with
our old thoughts, a tendency which is pernicious in our current
mode of thinking.

کوین
احساس می کردم چیزی را که قبلاً نمی دانستم کشف کردم. وس (اشاره به دهانش)
اینجاست که دستیابی به موفقیت اتفاق می افتد. درست در اینجا erhard (در حال پیشروی)
یک ثانیه صبر کنید ، این چیزی است که ما باید در اینجا انجام دهیم. کوین ، آیا می دانید که هستید
لکنت؟ کوین
خوب ، این یک نوع تعجب آور است درز
من می خواهم که شما با آن بیدار شوید. تو لکنت هستی ، دوست من شما فکر می کنید دقیق و مراقب هستید ،
اما شما در واقع لکنت هستید. شما دقت و مراقبت را اشتباه می کنید - که قابل ستایش است - برای وجود
stingy شما غیرقانونی هستید بزرگ نیست این افراد را به دیدگاه شما ثبت نمی کند. این مردم را بیگانه می کند. آنها با شما لعنتی نمی کنند زیرا شما خیلی مراقب و دقیق هستید. اما آنها شما را دوست ندارند. این است
غیر جذاب و شما را از بین می برد. شما احتمالاً چیزی برای دادن دارید ، اما هیچ کس چنین نخواهد کرد
آن را از شما دریافت کنید مردم از افراد خاردار "دریافت نمی کنند". من نیازی به این ندارم که شما در مورد آن بحث کنید
من کوین
من مهم نیست که در مورد آن با شما بحث کنم ، من واقعاً نمی توانم در ذهنم جایی که من لک می زنم ، بدم
من فکر نمی کنم که افراد دیگر احساس کنند که من لکنت دارم. من مشکلات دیگری دارم ، اما در جستجوی آن هستم
در جایی که من لک هستم و آن را نمی بینم. درز
و این همان کاری است که من می خواهم انجام دهید. من می خواهم که شما امشب در مورد استینگ بودن در این سوال بمانید. آیا شما ازدواج کرده اید؟ کوین
بله درز
از همسرتان بپرس (خنده)
منظور من استینگ با پول نیست. منظورم استینگ با ارسال عمل ، استینگ با
کمک به زنده بودن ، با توانمندسازی. از همسرتان بپرسید ، یا از افرادی که کار می کنند بپرسید
برای شما خوب ، لطفا ادامه دهید. منظور من این نیست که شما را در این مورد قطع کنم ، من فکر می کنم که مفیدتر است
برای اینکه شما یک شبه به آن نگاهی بیندازید ، و اگر می خواهید در مورد آن بحث کنید بیشتر مایل هستم
این کار را فردا انجام دهید آیا این همه با شما درست است؟ روز اول انجمن: جلسه چهارم
279
کوین
مطمئناً درز
ممنون کوین
من کجا بودم؟ من قصد داشتم موفقیت خود را به اشتراک بگذارم. درز
شما قصد داشتید موفقیت "حدس" خود را به اشتراک بگذارید. کوین
اکنون حتی مطمئن نیستم که دستیابی به موفقیت چیست. در هر صورت ، احساس می کنم اتفاقی افتاده است. من
نمی دانم وهمی
من نمی خواهم آن را بشنوم. شما یا می خواهید بگویید که یک موفقیت وجود دارد ، یا می خواهید
بگویید که دستیابی به موفقیت وجود ندارد. اما هیچ حدس وجود ندارد شاید وجود ندارد جایی برای
نگاه کن کوین
من یک موفقیت را داشتم زیرا اتفاق جدیدی و متفاوت برای من اتفاق می افتد که من نبودم
قبلاً تجربه شده است. وهمی
نه ، شما یک موفقیت موفقیت آمیز داشتید زیرا چنین می گویید. درز
کوین ، دستیابی به موفقیت یک پدیده اعلامیه است. آیا معنای ادعای را می دانید؟ در
معنای معمول ادعا؟ کوین
بله erhard دستیابی به موفقیت یک ادعا نیست. کوین
خوب درز
این یک اعلامیه است 280
وجود
کوین
خوب درز
این یک موضع است که موضوع را می گیرد. این همان چیزی است که وس با شما بحث می کند ، تا بیشتر آن را بیان کنید
زبان فنی کوین
خوب درز
این منظور او وقتی می گوید "این است که شما می گویید."
کوین
خوب درز
مثل اعلامیه کوین دستیابی به موفقیت من راکت من بود ، که راکت من بود که درست در مقابل همه من ایستاده بود
زمان آن بود که من باید همه کارها را انجام دهم: هر چیز خدایی در جهان برای همه. من
حتی باید این انجمن را برای شما اجرا کنید. (خنده)
اکنون برخی از مردم می خندند ، اما با ادامه این انجمن ، فهمیدم که من
این انجمن را اجرا می کرد زیرا این انجمن راه درستی را برای من کار نمی کرد ، بنابراین من بودم
نیاز به تنظیم در انجمن ، بنابراین برای من درست کار می کرد. و بنابراین من ساختم
آن تنظیمات وقتی می خواستم به حمام بروم ، به حمام رفتم. و من سعی کردم
به موقع بیایید ، اما من چند بار دیر کردم ، بنابراین حدس می زنم این بدان معنی است که من واقعاً سعی نکرده ام. وهمی
نه این بدان معنی است که دیر شده اید. کوین (خنده)
ببخشید من این را گفتم درز
شما امتحان کردید کوین
خوب من باید همه کارها را انجام دهم زیرا همه افراد اطرافم بی اثر هستند. و من خیلی خوبم
در آن من می توانم هر کاری انجام دهم این را برطرف کنید ، مطمئن شوید که همه چیز انجام می شود ، و من نمی توانم اجازه دهم کسی انجام دهد
هر چیزی برای من و من از این امر آگاه بودم ، اما هرگز ندیدم که این یک ویژگی غالب از آن باشد
زندگی من همانطور که تا امروز انجام دادم. در آن مرحله ذهنم را خالی می کند. روز اول انجمن: جلسه چهارم
281
درز
کوین ، آخرین چیزی که شما فقط گفتید چیست؟ کوین
من می ترسم از تکرار هر چیزی که گفتم جالب است. (خنده)
نه ، من گفتم: "در آن مرحله ذهنم را خالی می کند."
درز
دریافت کرد وهمی
بگذارید راهی به شما بدهم که نگاه کنم ... erhard
به هر حال ، شما از من نمی ترسید ، از نگاه بد می ترسید. کوین
من از شما نمی ترسم ... erhard
درست است شما از بد نگاه کردن می ترسید. کوین
من کمی از شما می ترسم. (خنده)
درز
من می خواهم شما را با آن توهم ترک کنم. (خنده)
وهمی
در داخل آنچه شما گفتید ، من روش دیگری برای دیدن آن یا جنبه ای از آن به شما می دهم-
چیزی که باید امشب به همراه اظهار نظر ورنر در مورد استینگ خود باشید: شما
مقاومت در برابر حضور در مکالمه مربیگری. کوین
بله 282
وجود
وهمی
شما می خواهید این کار را به روش خود انجام دهید. اکنون شما تنها در این اتاق نیستید که می خواهد آن را انجام دهد
راه یا راه او این انسان است و این پوچی انسان است. چون شما
تمام راه خود را انجام دادید و شما را به جایی که اکنون هستید ، برد - نه ، ببخشید - این شما را به جایی که شما می بردید
قبل از انجمن بودند بنابراین اگر اکنون حقیقت را در مورد جایی که قبل از انجمن بودید بگویید ،
شما می توانید از انجام زندگی به روش خود استفاده کنید. این سیاره پر از افرادی است که زندگی خود را انجام می دهند
راه کوین
اما من این کار را بیشتر از هر کس دیگری در این اتاق انجام داده ام. وهمی
همیشه کوین
نه ، من از این مطمئن هستم. ببینید من شواهدی دارم فقط چند نفر در اینجا وجود دارند که نمی توانند
به خود اجازه دهید ضبط شوند. و من قبلاً با افراد دیگر صحبت کرده ام. من آنها را جستجو نکردم
بعد از آن حادثه احمقانه در اینجا. و من در اینجا مسدود می شوم. وهمی
شما عالی کار می کنید شما در واقع از آن خارج می شوید. اگر من درست می شنوم: شما مایل به گفتن یکی از آنها هستید
خودت ، درست است؟ کوین
بله وهمی
شخصی که در برابر مکالمه مربیگری مقاومت می کند هرگز مربی نمی شود. یعنی
آن را ... کوین
شما یک مربی عالی هستید ، اما ببخشید ، من ... من فقط هر آنچه را که می خواهم از شما بگیرم. همه چیز از طریق نوعی fi leter می آید ، و من فقط هر آنچه را که فکر می کنم برای من خوب است ، می گیرم
و بقیه آن فکر می کنم ، در بیشتر قسمت های توپ ، اما جایی که کمی پیچ خورده اید
در آنجا ، من نمی خواهم آن را بپذیرم. وهمی
درست است ، البته. من نمی گویم "همه چیز را باور کن". این طرف دیگر از آنچه من هستم نیست
گفتن اما با آن همراه نیست. ما در مورد مکالمه مربیگری صحبت می کنیم. کوین
خوب است من به خودم اجازه نمی دهم. می ترسم خودم را در دست شخص دیگری بگذارم
کاملاً به کسی کاملاً اعتماد کنید. روز اول انجمن: جلسه چهارم
283
وهمی
خوب کوین
من همیشه باید از آن ، به هر شکلی که می توانم پشتیبان بگیرم ، به طوری که اگر آنها را پیچ کنند ، راهی برای بدست آوردن خواهم داشت
خودم از اوضاع خارج می شوم. وس (تغییر به جلو و عقب)
بله بنابراین شما این را دوست دارید. یک پا یک نوع در ، یک پا Kinda؟ در مربیگری ، درست است؟ کوین
از نظر حرفه ای من بسیار مؤثر بوده ام. بسیار موفق بوده است پس چرا من اینجا هستم ، خوب چون این
در جنبه های دیگر زندگی من کار نمی کند. وهمی
حتی ممکن است در منطقه ای که فکر می کنید کار می کند کار نکند. کوین
خوب من فکر می کنم شواهد عینی خاصی در آنجا وجود دارد که ... وس
اوه ، من می دانم که شما موفق هستید و همه چیز را دارید ، اما شما هیچ تصوری از آنچه می توانستید ندارید
ممکن است کوین
اوه بله ، من موافقم ، اکنون ، به عقب نگاه می کنم ، می توانم ببینم چه کاری بهتر می توانستم انجام دهم ، اگر من ... wes
بله ، حتی با در نظر گرفتن اینکه چه کسی می توانید در زندگی باشید. کوین
درست وهمی
به جای اینکه فقط موفق باشید ، اما چه کسی می توانید باشید. (به گروه)
کوین در حال گفتن چیزی قدرتمند در گفتن شخصی به خودش است. به یاد داشته باشید: مردم در برابر بودن مقاومت می کنند
مربی ، بنابراین ما واقعاً برای سهم دیگران باز نیستیم. و تا حدی که این کار را می کنید
شما سهم موجود را از دست می دهید. اکنون می توانید آن را ببینید. شما همیشه بالا خواهید آمد
با داستانی که توجیهی آن را می خواند. همیشه داستانی وجود دارد که توجیهی آن را بیان می کند: "من این را دوست ندارم" ؛ "آنها هستند
این را به من می فروشد "؛" آنها این را گفتند "؛ و غیره این انسان است. کوین
اوه ، من بسیاری از آن داستانها را دارم. 284
وجود
وهمی
و یک امکان دیگر در خارج از داستان وجود دارد. و آنچه شما باید برای ورود به آن انجام دهید مانند این است
شما می گویید ، "تسلیم چیزی شوید." من کلمه را دوست ندارم ... چیزی را برای ورود به
آنجا تمایل به مشارکت ، سخاوتمند بودن ، بزرگ بودن ، پیشبرد عمل ... کوین
احساس می کنم باید چیزی را ریسک کنم. وهمی
بله کوین
و ... من باید چیزی را که واقعاً برای من مهم است ، به خطر بیاورم ، و من نیستم
حتی مطمئن باشید که در این مرحله چه خواهد بود. این واقعاً سخت خواهد بود این خواهد بود
واقعی سخت است زیرا من چیزی را خطر نمی کنم. کله
خود را بسته نگه دارید ، این چیزی است که سخت بوده است. نمی تواند سخت تر از شما باشد
اکنون انجام می دهد کوین
خوب ، من فکر نمی کنم که داستانی فراتر از آن داشته باشم. وهمی
این چیزی است که من می پرسم. به این گفتگو در مورد سخاوتمند بودن ، در مورد بزرگ بودن ، نگاه کنید
با مربیگری ، به این موضوع نگاه کنید به آنچه شما مایل به خطر هستید. امشب و برگرد
و فردا آن را به اشتراک بگذارید. کوین
خوب کله
این چیزی که شما در مورد فیلمبرداری وجود دارد چیست؟ کوین
خوب ، من واقعاً تعجب کرده ام که تعداد بیشتری از مردم نمی خواهند فیلمبرداری شوند. من به شما اعتماد ندارم من هستم
مایل به فیلمبرداری نیستم زیرا من به سازمان اعتماد ندارم ، ما و A. چون فکر می کنم
شما آن را لعنتی خواهید کرد ، به یک روش یا دیگری. و هنگامی که روی نوار است ، آنجا است ، چیزهای زیادی وجود دارد که می توانید
با آن انجام دهید اتفاقات زیادی می تواند برای آن رخ دهد. من کنترل آن را از دست می دهم. بنابراین من نمی خواهم دوباره کنترل خود را از دست بدهم. بنابراین من
نمی بینید که چرا من باید فیلمبرداری کنم ، این برای مزایای شما است. این به من کمک نمی کند من به اینجا آمدم تا
به من کمک کن کله
و برای روشن شدن ، من طرفدار این نیستم که شما باید فیلمبرداری کنید. فقط بین تو و من
نمی توان آنچه را که در مورد آن بود ، بدست آورد. بنابراین من نیازی به این کار ندارم. منتظر جهش
هایدگر می گوید ، برای گفتگو برای حفظ وجود وجود دارد ،
آیا ترک یک "عطش دانش و حرص و آز است
توضیحات "؛ ما باید در عوض ، مایل باشیم صبر کنیم و" بمانیم
به امید قبل از آنچه شایسته اندیشه است "(" DL "در OWL 13)
محقق ژاپنی ، حتی هایدگر ابراز بی تاب بودن با خود
تردید مبهم شریک زندگی: "من از شما پنهان نمی شوم که شما
من را به حالت آشفتگی بزرگ می اندازند. "
"به خصوص به این دلیل که تمام کار من برای پاسخ به سوال من است
از کارشناسان زبان و دانشمندان زبانی زبان چنین است
بیهوده بود "(" DL "در OWL 28). تحریک هایدگر ممکن است به کسانی از ما که ،
پرتاب شده به فرمول کارآمد تعاریف و مفاهیم ،
با این وجود آرزو به گفتگوی واقعی فلسفی - کنفرانس
که در بومی اجازه "تفکر عمیق" را می دهد. چنین گفتگو ،
که فکر می کند راه خود را به ناشناخته و به گفتگو اعتماد دارد
خود برای یافتن راهی برای بیرون آمدن ، یک کار چالش برانگیز است ، به خصوص به عنوان
فرم تحقیق آموزشی. تعادل متقابل و هدایت در هستی شناختی
گفتگو یکی از تمایزهای موجود در ناگفته است
پیشینه انجمن و این کتاب. قصد ایجاد گفتگوی هستی شناختی این است
فکر کردن به فکر و در نهایت غیرقابل تصور است. به طور متناقض ، چنین تفکری هم به آرامی و هم ناگهان اتفاق می افتد. به عنوان
ورنر ارهارد آن را بیان کرده است ، شما آن را دریافت نمی کنید و آن را دریافت نمی کنید و
روز اول انجمن: جلسه چهارم
285
کوین
واکنش همه چیز چیست؟ کله
نه ، دقیقاً همان چیزی که شما گفتید ، که به آن اعتماد نکردید. روشی که اعتماد کردید ، اعتماد در دسترس نیست. اعتماد
به شما حسابداری است. کوین
درست کله
بنابراین وقتی حوصله دارید ، این برگه حسابداری بزرگ را با نام همه در آن دریافت می کنید. KIPP یک نمایش سرگرم کننده از دیدگاه کوین در مورد اعتماد انجام داد: به عنوان یک حسابداری ، با استفاده از یک
لیستی را که با او حمل می کرد ، از افرادی که به او اعتماد نداشت ، منتقل کرد. KIPP (ادامه)
و شما در مسیر زندگی قدم می زنید ، با پد کوچک خود با نام همه در آن ، و "شما
به یاد داشته باشید دوازده سال پیش ما روی آن کار کار می کردیم ، من می خواستم آن کار را انجام دهم ، اما شما
به من رسیدم و من این کار را نکردم؟ "
(عبور از نام آن شخص در یک لیست تخیل)
"هفده سال پیش ، آن پیک نیک شرکت ، شما به سمت رئیس رفتید و شروع به صحبت با او کردید
او؟ و او دیگر با من صحبت کرد؟ "
(عبور از نام شخص دیگر ؛ اشاره به شخص دیگری)
"شما کاری نکردید جز کسی که ریش مانند آن انجام داد."
(عبور از نام دیگر در لیست ، به خنده)
این همان چیزی است که شما اعتماد می نامید. کوین
اما لیست من طولانی تر است. کله
هیچ اعتماد در آنجا وجود ندارد ، فقط اضافه کردن و پیگیری. کوین
درست است کله
اعتماد من از شما دعوت می کنم تا در نظر بگیرید که شاید اعتماد به نفس باشد ، "من به شما اعتماد دارم."
شما آن را برای مدت طولانی دریافت نمی کنید و پس از آن همه به یکباره آن را می گیرید. این لحظه بینشی است که هایدگر آن را Augenblick می نامد - یک
لحظه دید - و او می گوید که به عنوان یک جهش رخ می دهد:
"
در اینجا هیچ پلی وجود ندارد - فقط جهش. [ بشر .]
جهش به تنهایی ما را به محله می برد
جایی که تفکر ساکن است. [ بشر .] برخلاف a
پیشرفت پایدار ، جایی که ما غافل می شویم
از یک چیز به چیز دیگر و همه چیز
یکسان باقی مانده است ، جهش ما را به طور ناگهانی به سمت خود می برد
جایی که همه چیز متفاوت است ، بسیار متفاوت است
که به ما عجیب و غریب می شود. [ بشر .] گرچه ما
ممکن است در چنین جهشی بنیانگذار نباشد ، چه جهشی است
ما را می برد تا ما را گیج کند. (WCT 8 ، 12)
حرف
از طرف دیگر ، او هشدار می دهد:
"
جهش و بینایی نیاز به آماده سازی طولانی و آهسته دارد. بشر بشر بشر (WCT 233)
حرف
هیچ کس فقط در یک جهش واحد نمی تواند
از دایره غالب ایده ها ، es-
به طور خاص نه اگر او با فرسوده سر و کار داشته باشد
آهنگ های تفکر سنتی - ردیابی هایی که محو می شوند
به قلمروهایی که به سختی دیده می شوند. ("DL" در جغد 36)
فقط کسی که شروع درست را انجام می دهد می تواند
جهش همه چیز با این اجرا تصمیم گرفته می شود ، برای آن
به این معنی است که ما خودمان در واقع سؤال می کنیم-
دوباره ، و اینکه ما ، در این سؤالات ، ما
ابتدا دیدگاه ها را ایجاد کنید. (من 196)
مگس
با این حال مهم است که دوباره به یاد داشته باشید که در حالی که ما در آن هستیم
راهی برای زبان و تفکر ، ما همیشه در زبان هستیم و
فکر کردن بنابراین پارادوکس و انعکاس پذیری ادامه می یابد ، یک بار
آن جهش را انجام داده اند:
286
وجود
کوین
اما من نمی کنم کله
درست است من نگفتم من شما را در اعتماد به نفس دست نمی دهم. من از آن طرفداری نمی کنم ... erhard
او نمی خواهد این مسئله را بدست آورد زیرا او هنوز تمایز بین ادعای و
اعلامیه کوین ، آیا می دانید که شما در پاسخ به KIPP کل شماره خود را انجام داده اید؟ شما "stingy" انجام دادید. شما "خطر نکنید" ؛ شما "هیچ کس این کار را درست نکرد."
کوین
بله درز
مثل شمارش پایین این کاملاً اتوماتیک بود. کوین
بله درز
نه یک چیزی که شما گفتید یک تکه اطلاعات در آن وجود داشت. من می خواهم شما به آنچه می گویم گوش دهید. این بیان هوش شما نبود. این بیان عقل سلیم شما نبود. من
بیان عمل شما بود - کاملاً به عمل شما محدود شده است. شما در این مورد چاره ای نداشتید. این محصول یک انتخاب هوشمندانه یا یک انتخاب مشترک نبود. کوین
من آن را می پذیرم وهمی
بنابراین شما این تکلیف را گرفتید؟ کوین
بله وهمی
من فقط می خواهم تمایل شما برای حضور در این گفتگو را تصدیق کنم. کوین
من فقط می خواستم به همه افراد در سالن اجتماعات بگویم ، که من در کنار هم هستم. این نیست
که بد است "
و کجا جهش یافته ایم؟ شاید به یک
پرتگاه؟ نه! در عوض ، بر روی برخی از خاک های محکم. برخی؟ نه! اما در آن خاک که ما در آن زندگی می کنیم و
اگر با خودمان صادق باشیم ، بمیریم. کنجکاو ،
در واقع چیز بی وقفه که ابتدا باید جهش کنیم
روی خاک که واقعاً روی آن ایستاده ایم. (WCT 41 ،
حرف
تأکید اضافه شده)
در تمایز جهش ، هایدگر بازتابی را ادامه می دهد
فکر او را توصیف می کند: ما به جایی که در حال حاضر هستیم جهش می کنیم. در وجود و زمان ، او می گوید که داسین "وجودی وجود دارد
که ، در پتانسیل خود ، هنوز هم نیست. بشر بشر بشر [o] nly چون
این همان چیزی است که می شود (یا در عوض ، نمی شود) ، می تواند بگوید
به خودی خود "به آنچه شما هستید" تبدیل شوید و این را با درک بگویید "
(Bt 185-186). محقق جوآن استامباگ این حرکت را می نامد
فکر کردن "رسیدن مداوم به آنچه که به آن می رسد"
(شناسه 14). همانطور که در جای دیگر ذکر کردیم ، چنین انعطاف پذیری برای مهم است
به فکر ذن ، همانطور که ارهارد مشاهده کرده است: "در ذن ، یکی کار می کند
به سمت روشنگری از و در زمینه موجود بودن
روشنگری "(بارتلی 125). ■

(تشویق)
در این مرحله جین دست خود را بلند کرد. وقتی او ایستاد ، ظاهر او به طرز چشمگیری متفاوت بود ، و
شرکت کنندگان تحسین کردند. erhard (به جین)
آیا می دانید آنها در مورد چه چیزی دست و پنجه نرم می کنند؟ جین
شماره (خنده)

آیا مردم برای افراد بی ارزش زشت دست و پنجه نرم نمی کنند؟ جین

هوم هومم. (خنده)
درز
شما این را گرفتید؟ شما در مکالمات ما بزرگ و سخاوتمند بوده اید ، نه؟ جین
بله درز
خوب هیچ چیز برای خجالت کشیدن در آنجا نیست. هیچ چیز برای گرفتار شدن
نوع دیگری از سخاوت و این سخاوتمندی است که آنها فکر می کنند می بینند و فکر می کنم در آن می بینم
شروع شما برای پیاده شدن از آن. مثل پیاده شدن از عمل خود در مورد بی ارزش بودن. همه آن چیزهای دیگر 288
وجود
جین
بله درز
شما فکر می کنید از این کار خارج می شوید؟ زشت و بی ارزش بودن؟ جین
از بعضی جهات ، اما احتمالاً هنوز هم با من خواهد بود. درز
شما می گویید که از آن خارج می شوید ، اما این به نوعی احتمالاً هنوز هم با شما خواهد بود؟ جین
بله درز
چیزهای زن و شوهر اول از همه ، تفاوت بین میمون ها و شما و من وجود دارد: شما و من
"Probablys" داشته باشید. میمون هیچ احتمالی ندارد ، زیرا میمون دارای لیست نیست
از اینجا - از جذابیت او مکیده نشوید ... (خنده)
میمون هیچ "احتمالی" ندارد زیرا میمون هیچ زبانی ندارد. فقط شما
و من Probablys دارم. و ما آن احتمالی را با دهان خود اختراع می کنیم. ما این را نمی دانیم ما
فکر کنید ما با برون یابی گذشته به آینده ، Probablys را اختراع می کنیم. شما درک می کنید
کلمه "برون یابی"؟ جین
شماره erhard
گذشته را به آینده گسترش می دهید؟ شما می دانید که خطی را می گیرید که اینگونه پیش می رود ... (ترسیم یک خط در هوا)
و بعد اینگونه پیش می رود. شما خط را از گذشته به آینده گسترش می دهید. جین
بله درز
بنابراین ، من و شما فکر می کنیم که ما می گوییم احتمالاً براساس این عمل ذهنی به نام گسترش
گذشته به آینده و به همین دلیل شما به من گفتید "احتمالاً" ، اینطور نیست؟ روز اول انجمن: جلسه چهارم
289
جین
بله درز
از آنجا که با توجه به گذشته خود ، احتمالاً نمی خواهید آن را کاملاً پیاده کنید ، شما هستید؟ جین
بله درز
و این برخورد معقول و هوشمندانه با آینده به عنوان گسترش گذشته است. آیا شما
آنچه را که گفتم دنبال کنید؟ جین
کمی درز
وقتی گفتید "من احتمالاً کاملاً از آن خارج نمی شوم" ، گفتم که این یک هوشمند و معقول است
گسترش گذشته خود به آینده. جین
خوب درز
خوب اکنون بحث خاصی وجود دارد که اکنون می خواهم با شما داشته باشم. قبلی ما
بحث برای منافع شما بوده است. این یکی از من برای منافع گروه است. من فکر می کنم
شما چیزی برای کمک به اینجا دارید. که شما مثالی خواهید بود که نشان می دهد چه چیزی
از مردم می خواهید که بتوانند به همان اندازه قدرتمند ببینند که هر کس دیگری در این انجمن می تواند آن را نشان دهد. من
می خواهم مستقیم با شما باشم و به شما بگویم که اگر مایل به این کار باشید می توانم از این کار خارج شوم
بحث با من و شما نمی دانید که این بحث چیست ؛ شما باید فرصتی بگیرید. من نمی گویم شما هیچ ارزشی از آن دریافت نخواهید کرد ، زیرا ممکن است. من گمان می کنم شما این کار را خواهید کرد. احتمالاً. (جین لبخند می زند)
کسی قبلاً لبخند او را می بیند؟ خوب ، پس ، تو با من؟ آماده انجام این کار هستید؟ جین
بله درز
در اوایل ما وقتی چهار نفر بودید ، فای ، یا شش ساله بودیم و برای کسی به نظر می رسید
از آن سن برای اینکه مادرتان از او گرفته شود ... می گیرید که این به نظر می رسد برای یک کودک
آن سن ، که "مادرم مرا ترک کرد ، یا مرا رها کرد ، یا او را از دست داد؟" به هر حال ، آن
هیچ مشکلی ایجاد نمی کند که او نمی تواند آن را به خاطر بسپارد. به یاد داشته باشید که به من گفتید نمی توانید
این را خیلی واضح به یاد دارید؟ اما ما می دانیم که این اتفاق افتاده است و کسی یا به شما یا شما گفته است
fi آن را بیرون زد. این چیزی نیست که شما مستقیماً به یاد داشته باشید ، درست است؟ 290
وجود
جین
بله درز
درست این قدرتمندتر از آنچه او به یاد می آورد وجود دارد. آیا کسی وجود دارد که این کار را نمی کند
می فهمید که من فقط گفتم؟ بایستید (یک شرکت کننده ایستاده)
من گفتم ، وقتی که به رسمیت شناخته نشده است ، چه چیزی وجود دارد. من از این کلمه متنفرم اما می خواهم از آن استفاده کنم
دیر می شود و من می خواهم مردم بفهمند - چه چیزی وجود دارد و ناخودآگاه در آنجا بیشتر است
با قدرت از نظر توانایی آن در شکل گیری رفتار و احساسات و افکار خود از
آنچه در آنجاست و آگاه است شما آن را گرفتید؟ شرکت کننده
بله ، من آن را کردم. درز
خوب ، بنابراین او در آنجا است که او آن را به یاد می آورد یا نه. و سپس این زن بود که
وارد شد و پیوند را که پناهگاه شما بود ، به همراه پدرتان شکست. جین
بله درز
خوب و من گفتم که ... من اول پرسیدم که آیا تصمیمی اتخاذ کرده اید یا خیر. شما آن را به یاد دارید؟ (بسیاری از شرکت کنندگان در حال پاسخ دادن به "بله")
هرچه بود ، او تصمیم گرفت. و من گفتم این یک نکته مهم بود ، این بود
چیزی که همه باید بدست آورند. من گفتم: "ما در مورد آن مانند" من تصمیم گرفتم "و شاید شما صحبت کنیم
انجام داد ، اما آنچه واقعاً اتفاق افتاد این است که شما ههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههه
"من بی ارزش هستم." این فقط "من تصمیم گرفتم." این به اندازه کافی نیرو نیست. این: شما شدی من هستم
بی ارزش است. "" شما آن را به یاد می آورید ، مبهم؟ جین
کمی درز
خوب ، خوب erhard (به گروه)
شما آن را به یاد دارید؟ روز اول انجمن: جلسه چهارم
291
(بسیاری از آنها پاسخ می دهند "بله")
به یاد داشته باشید من گفتم "شما چیزی می شوید." شما بی ارزش هستید یا اینکه آن را با کمی بیشتر بگویید
سخت گیری: شما اکنون این هستید که بی ارزش هستید. همه این را گرفتند؟ کسی این کار را نکرد؟ خوب
خوب حالا آنچه ما می خواهیم به آن نگاه کنیم این است که این همه ظروف سرباز یا مسافر از کجا تولید شده است؟ چرا
کسی به اندازه کافی احمق است که بتواند نوع آشفتگی خود را ایجاد کند؟ هر کسی مشخص نیست
اینجا آشفتگی؟ آیا باید بیشتر برای شما آشفتگی کنیم؟ همه آشفتگی دارند مردم اینجا
برای شروع کار خوبی هستند و هنوز هم آشفتگی داریم. آیا می توانید تصور کنید که چه خواهد بود
مثل کسی که در شکل بد است؟ ما افرادی را که از نظر بد هستند ، نمایش می دهیم. ما فقط
بگذارید افرادی در اینجا که از نظر شکل خوبی هستند. بیشتر افرادی که در برنامه های ما شرکت کرده اند
در تعدیل زندگی بالاتر از حد متوسط ​​هستند. آنها می توانند به طور متوسط ​​زندگی را اداره کنند. آنچه ما هستیم
به اینجا نگاه می کنم این است که این ظروف سرباز یا مسافر از کجا آمده است؟ (مکث)
اکنون باید به جایی که جین بود برگردید. من گفتم من می خواهم شما در یک بودن ایستاده باشید
چهار ساله ، چهار ساله و من می خواهم به من بگویید-می خواهم بدانم-از چه چیزی به نظر می رسد
آنجا بنابراین شما می خواهید به آنجا برسید تا این امر را بدست آورید. شما باید یک دختر کوچک باشید
از بین رفته است یا او را رها کرد یا از او دور شد ، که تنها مکان تعلق آن در او است
رابطه با پدرش. و آن پیوندی که برای او نشان می دهد تنها مکان تعلق ،
که نمایانگر "خانه" او است - منظور من یک ساختمان با یک خانواده در آن نیست - منظورم یک خانه است ،
مثل خانه بودن ، خانه. خانه بودن ، خانه. و آن پیوند ، که نمایانگر خانه بودن است: خانه
شکسته است و بنابراین فکر می کنید چه زمانی تصمیم می گیرید که این اتفاق می افتد؟ شما ایده ای دارید
شما تصمیم گرفتید که اوضاع آنقدر فاسد شد؟ جین
فکر می کنم تصمیم گرفتم او را دوست نداشته باشم و او را نادیده بگیرم. درز
بله خیلی خوب و شما در بالای آن تلاش کرده اید که سعی کنید در مورد آن خوب باشید.
او را دوست دارم و سعی می کنید به او احترام بگذارید؟ بله؟ جین
بله اما من نمی توانم این کار را انجام دهم. درز
بله این همان چیزی است که شما در مورد اوضاع تصمیم گرفتید. در مورد زندگی چه تصمیمی گرفتید؟ می توانی
به یاد دارید؟ نگاهی بیندازید جین
من سعی می کردم او را بیرون بکشم تا پدرم بیشتر از او دوست داشته باشد. درز
بله این عالی است بنابراین این به دنبال وضعیت است. شما تصمیم گرفتید که در مورد اوضاع
نامادری شما آنچه می خواهم بدانم و آنچه می خواهم شما به جین نگاه کنید این است که اگر می توانید ببینید چه چیزی
شما در مورد زندگی خود تصمیم گرفتید. نگاهی بیندازید و ببینید که در مورد زندگی خود تصمیم گرفتید. 292

و آنچه شما می خواهید انجام دهید این است که یک دختر چهار ساله ، چهار ساله ، مادرش گرفته شده است
او را دور کرده یا او را رها کرد و تنها محل تعلق آن ، تنها مکان او برای بودن است ، مانند در
خانه ، پدرش بود و این تازه خرد شد. در مورد زندگی چه تصمیمی گرفتید؟ شما می بینید ، شما
تمام آن تصمیماتی را که او درباره خودش و در مورد نامادری خود گرفته بود ، اتخاذ کرد و در مورد چگونه
او با نامادری خود و همه چیزها مقابله می کرد. آنچه اکنون می خواهم بدانم چیست
شما در مورد زندگی تصمیم گرفتید. (به یک شرکت کننده با دست بلند)
من پاسخی نمی خواهم ؛ من می خواهم شما فکر کنید. (نشانگر جین)
او پاسخ خواهد داد: شما فکر می کنید. (به جین)
به یاد دارید چه چیزی در مورد زندگی تصمیم گرفتید؟ "من تصمیم گرفتم ..."
جین
بی ارزش بودن درز
منظورتان این است که سعی کنید بر بی ارزش بودن غلبه کنید. جین
بله درز
این چیزی است که شما در مورد خودتان تصمیم گرفتید. در مورد زندگی چه تصمیمی گرفتید؟ جین
من نمی دانم درز
خوب خوب (به گروه)
بنابراین من می خواهم به شما بگویم که شما در مورد زندگی تصمیم گرفتید ، زیرا یکی از این موارد را دارید. شما ممکن است
وقتی این تصمیم را گرفتید ، یا ده ، یا یازده یا دوازده نفر بودند ، اما همه افراد در
اتاق در برخی از شرایط مشابه آنچه جین فقط توصیف کرد ، همان تصمیم را گرفت. تنها تصمیم آشکاری که چنین کودکی می تواند اتخاذ کند ... و این تصمیم وجود دارد
اینجا چیزی اشتباه است کجا؟ کجا مشکلی وجود دارد؟ شما نیستید این بخشی است که شما
قبلاً در مورد ما گفته است. در اینجا مشکلی وجود دارد: در زندگی! اینجا مشکلی وجود دارد چیزی خاموش است مشکلی وجود دارد! آیا می توانید نتیجه گیری اجتناب ناپذیر باشد
برای برخی از یازده نفر از افراد به پایین؟ شما برای یک ثانیه در مورد آن فکر می کنید. اگر من شما را به عنوان یک
یک روش خشن
هایدگر می گوید: "کلمه" راه "
کلمه ای که با ذهن بازتابی انسان صحبت می کند "(" NL "در OWL 92). مفهوم اصلی استفاده هایدگر از" راه "برای تعیین
روند تفکر او خواستار عمل و هوشیاری برای حفظ است
زمین به دست آمده:
"
برای پاک کردن راهی ، به عنوان مثال در سراسر برفی-
Ered Field ، در گویش Alemannic-Swabian است
هنوز هم امروز وگن نامیده می شود. این فعل ، استفاده شده است
از لحاظ روحی ، به معنای: شکل گیری راهی و شکل گیری
آن را آماده نگه دارید. ساخت و ساز درک شده در
این حس دیگر به معنای جابجایی چیزی نیست
بالا و پایین مسیری که از قبل وجود دارد. من
به معنای آوردن راه است. بشر بشر اول از همه ، و
بنابراین راه است. ("WL" در جغد 129-30)
روز اول انجمن: جلسه چهارم
293
بزرگسال بزرگ ، سخت ، بالغ ، باهوش ، و من شما را به یک مجموعه به اندازه کافی بد می رسانم ، شما
آیا تا به حال به یاد داشته باشید که با خودتان بگویید ، "زندگی لعنتی"؟ می بینید که این نتیجه گیری برای یک آسان است
سه ساله ، چهار ساله ، کودک کودک؟ چه چیزی لازم است که به این نتیجه برسیم
سه ، چهار یا یک کودک؟ هیچ کس به مهمانی شما نمی آید. معنی مادر شما برای شما است. تقریباً
چیزی ، درست است؟ واقعی آسان است ، درست است؟ نه تنها آسان ، اجتناب ناپذیر است. و این صرفاً اجتناب ناپذیر نیست
به طور مداوم من قصد ندارم این قسمت را به شما نشان دهم ، من فقط می خواهم به شما بگویم. اینقدر
من از شما نمی خواهم که آن را بپذیرید یا آن را باور کنید: این همیشه انسان است -
که مشکلی وجود دارد اگر شما یک انسان هستید ، این اشتباه است
منتظر اتفاقات اکنون این را فراموش کنید ، زیرا من نمی خواهم شواهد کافی از شما ارائه دهم
این برای روشن شدن اما من فقط می خواهم شما آن را بشنوید. آنچه من می خواهم شما بدست آورید این است که اجتناب ناپذیر است
به طور مداوم وقتی بزرگ شدی شرایطی داشتید که در آن اجتناب ناپذیر باشد
نتیجه گیری این بود که ، باید این باشد که "اینجا مشکلی پیش آمده است!" مشکلی وجود دارد
ذاتاً ، عمیق ، عمیق ، در بنیاد ، مشکلی پیش آمده است! زندگی تشکیل شده است -
شما به این شرایط فکر نمی کنید ، اما زندگی به عنوان اشتباه است. چیزی اشتباه است! و شما این تصمیم را نمی گیرید. شما هستید که مشکلی وجود دارد اکنون ، شما نمی گیرید
که هنوز ؛ شما هنوز قرار نیست این را بدست آورید. شما قرار است آنچه را که من می گویم دنبال کنید. (قرار دادن به عنوان صدا در "سر" یک شرکت کننده)
"من ، من نمی دانم. من فکر نمی کنم که" این اشتباه است. "
ورنر ، من می بینم که منطقی است که باید در کودکی به این نتیجه برسم ،
مثل راهی برای بودن اما من این را نمی گیرم "مشکلی پیش آمده است." منظور من این است که واقعاً فکر می کنم
چیزهای درست زیادی وجود دارد منظور من این است که من زندگی خود را از آنجا زندگی نمی کنم - مشکلی وجود دارد. "
(بازگشت به صدای خودش)
این همان چیزی است که شما باید به خودتان بگویید ، مگر اینکه از قبل برای شما آشکار باشد که شما چه کسی هستید
آیا این مشکلی وجود دارد برای اکثر شما که هنوز واضح نیستید. آنچه گفتم خواهد بود
بدیهی: این که در کودکی و در اوایل کودکی شرایط موجود در آن وجود دارد
شما به عنوان یک کودک باید به نتیجه اجتناب ناپذیر برسید که مشکلی وجود دارد
در زندگی آن قسمت را می دانم که می توانید ببینید. بخشی که هنوز نمی توانید ببینید این است که چگونه امروز به این نتیجه برسید. اینقدر
ما امروز می خواهیم این موضوع را برای شما رقم بزنیم. جین ، بنابراین ، آنچه من گفتم حس کرد؟ مثل اینکه تصمیم گرفتید
مشکلی پیش آمد؟ جین
بله درز
شما به سوالی که پرسیدم پاسخ دادید: آیا منطقی است؟ جین
بله درز
شما به یاد می آورید که این نوع تصمیم را گرفته اید؟ یکی راه خود است ، زیرا تا زمانی که پیشرفت کند راهی وجود ندارد. این دیدگاه کار خودش در اوایل پدیدار شد
حرفه هایدگر به عنوان استاد فلسفه. در اینجا او توصیف می کند
پیشرفت او از این دیدگاه ، همانطور که در طول او برای او رخ داده است
البته او در اوایل کار خود تدریس کرد:
"
بشر بشر بشر این دوره ناقص ترین بود. هنوز آنجا
در آن تلاش برای طی کردن مسیر بود
که من نمی دانستم به کجا منجر می شود. من فقط فوری ترین برد کوتاه را می دانستم
چشم انداز در طول آن مسیر ، زیرا آنها
بی وقفه به من نگاه کرد ، در حالی که افق
ED را تغییر دهید و بیش از یک بار تاریک شد. ("DL" در جغد 6)
این اولین از سه امتیاز است که می خواهیم در اینجا استرس داشته باشیم
راه هایدگر: با ورود به راه بودن ، یکی
در حال پرش به ناشناخته است. این لازم است زیرا
فکر کردن به وجود نمی تواند قبل از وجود آن درک شود
فکر بنابراین تعهد آن لزوماً پیشرفت است
آنچه مشخص نیست اما توجه به این نکته حائز اهمیت است
به ناشناخته فقط فکر کردن در مورد برخی فکر نیست
محتوایی که ما هنوز درک نمی کنیم ، چیزی که ما هستیم
بدانید که ما نمی دانیم. این می تواند معادل بررسی جدید باشد
قلمرو با استفاده از نقشه ؛ اما هایدگر نقشه ای ندارد. ورنر ارهارد
این نکته را در مورد کار خودش بیان کرده است: در چنین تفکری ، ما هستیم
نه صرفاً در آبهای غیرمجاز بلکه در آب که انجام می شود
همیشه مانند آب رفتار نکنید ("قلب موضوع"). این یک نکته مهم برای هایدگر است: برای حضور در
راه ما باید خودمان را از زیربنای خود آزاد کنیم
"درک مشترک" ، که "متقاعد شده است که متولد شده است
درک همه چیز "(WCT 77). ما باید قضاوت کنیم
هر فکر جدید بر اساس اینکه آیا با آن سازگار است
افکار قدیمی ما ، گراندی که در جریان ما خطرناک است
حالت تفکر
