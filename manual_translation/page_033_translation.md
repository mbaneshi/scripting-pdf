Forum Day One: Session One 
19
ERHARD
What we were discussing is this in-order-to. I say the rain has no intention to do anything.
There’s nothing there that could intend. It just rains when it rains. There’s no intention in the
rain. Look, Charles, I’m doing something in the conversation which is designed to allow you to
take a look at your own beliefs. I’m asking questions which reduce your thesis to an absurdity.
If I ask if it rains in order to destroy life, you have to say yes if you believe that it rains in order
to sustain life, and so it makes you reexamine your theory. If you can consider the possibility 
that there is no intention in the rainstorm, then you are no longer stuck with what you used to 
believe.
CHARLES
I’ll keep looking at it.
ERHARD
We have to go quickly now or there won’t be any fi fth night. There’ll be a twelfth night. 
Someone raised a question about why participants were not allowed to take notes in The Forum, a policy 
that had been communicated when they registered for the course.
ERHARD
Because we don’t want you to retain information. So you don’t get stuck trying to remember 
something. You think Bjorn Borg remembers how to hold the tennis racket? This is no diff erent
than the conversation about the rainstorm.
(loudly)
You have this superstition that you do things because you remember how to do them! You don’t 
drive your car, play tennis, or live life powerfully and eff ectively out of anything you remember. 
If Joe Montana had to remember how to throw the football when he’s back in the pocket, he’d
get killed every Sunday.
A woman named Doris rose with a question about the rainstorm:
DORIS
What about the role of ultimate being in natural events?
ERHARD
I don’t like to discuss ultimate being with people who don’t know their ass from a hole in the 
ground.
DORIS
I fi nd that response pretty off ensive.
