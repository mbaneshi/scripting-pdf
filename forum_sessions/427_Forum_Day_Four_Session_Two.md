Forum Day Four: Session Two

WES (indicating both independent clauses of the sentence on the board)
These two are not equal and opposite forces: That’s the lie. It’s possible to have both of those and
no confl ict. They are not inherently confl icting. The “but” makes them confl icting. So, we change
“but” to “and.” If we say, “I want to go to the beach and I don’t have time,” we’d be telling the
truth about the two forces operating on us. “I want to go to the beach,” and “I don’t have time.”
But is there a problem? Does “I want to go to the beach and I don’t have time” occur as a problem?
GRACE
Yes, it occurs as a problem because you’re dealing with two opposing forces.
WES
No, they are not opposing.
GRACE
They’re separate and distinct.
WES
You’re the one who said so a moment ago.
GRACE
Right. What next?
WES
So: “I am here in The Forum and I want to eat.” Is that a problem?
GRACE
Not unless there’s a “but” in there.
WES
Do you hear a problem there?
GRACE
No.
WES
But: “I’m here in The Forum, but I’m starving to death.” Do you hear a problem?
GRACE
Yes.
WES
Taking the same forces and I’ve presented them to create a confl ict, at which I am at the eff ect
and stuck with. And it comes from, not from life, because in reality there are no problems, it
The ring of truth signals not only “Of course! That’s true!” but also,
embedded in its reverberations, “It’s been true all along.”

In the early- to mid-1980s, during the period when the est Train-
t
ing was being retired and The Forum was being generated, Erhard’s
organization produced a series of audiotapes. In them, we hear Erhard
developing distinctions, oft en in dialogic sessions with seminar
participants. In some, the influence of Heidegger’s vocabulary may be
heard. In others, we observe Erhard exploring other articulations. As
with Heidegger, Erhard’s work is generated from a central distinction,
which may be approached from an abundance of starting points.
One such starting point is the drift , a distinction developed
on the 1985 audiotape, “Eff ective Action and Accomplishment.”
This distinction opens a way to Erhard’s central transformational
distinction; we suggest that the dynamic of this distinction may be
analogized to several that Heidegger hints at throughout his work,
with rubrics such as thrownness, the “they,” and the play of Being.
To use a Heideggerian term, the two men are saying the Same (see
the sidebar entitled “The Same” in Session Three of Day Three).
In this 1985 seminar, the distinction is teased out collabora-
tively in the interactions between Erhard and the seminar partici-
pants, all of whom have had previous experience of The Forum and
are familiar with Erhard’s basic vocabulary of distinctions and the
rhetorical dialogue in which they get distinguished. In what follows
here, we provide brief excerpts (elisions are not shown).
Erhard opens the seminar with the image of a “boat in the
water with no rudder and no sails”:
Now when you put a boat in the water it
doesn’t stay still. It moves. And some ninny on
the shore might say, “Boy, there’s a lot of in-
tention in that boat.” But really what there is
in the boat is drift . So I want to invent this dis-
tinction for ourselves called the drift . You and
I are drift ing. Life is drift ing. The world is drift -
ing. Humanity is drift ing. The United States is
drift ing. . . . There’s a certain drift . And there’s
no distinction called the drift .

SPEAKING BEING
comes from me and my speaking. So here’s what there is to get: all your problems as stucknesses
are lies. All your problems as stucknesses are lies. All the presentation of the stuff  there, that’s
not a lie. “I want to go to the beach and I don’t have time”: That’s not a lie and it’s not a problem.
GRACE
Right.
WES
Any time you fi nd yourself stuck. Not moving. That’s bullshit. You’ve lied. Wake up! The stuck is the
lie. It comes from the—not the use of the word “but”—this is not about take every “but” out of your
language—this is about: Appreciate what you’re presenting in the problem, with “but,” or whatever
you use. Whenever you try to make things opposing and put yourself at the eff ect of them, there’s a lie
there and you’re doing it, and the lie is that you’re not doing it. The lie is: You’re not doing it when you
really are. That’s the lie. Nothing is inherently stuck in life. Life’s moving along fi ne. You see that?
GRACE
Yes.
As Grace sat Donald raised his hand and stood up again.
DONALD
So if I say “I want to lose weight, but I hate dieting,” there’s a lie there. It’s like saying “I want to
lose weight and you’re wearing a black vest.” Or “I want to lose weight and Vaclav Havel is the
president of Yugoslavia.”
WES
Yeah, it’s that crazy, really. Why would anybody be so crazy as to do that?
DONALD
To be a victim.
WES
Not just victim, but to be a racketeer.
DONALD
So if I say “I’m overweight because my mother used to make fritters,” that’s the same lie.
WES
Yeah.
DONALD
Like “I’m overweight because you’re wearing a black sweater.” But the reason I blame my mother,
say, when I don’t like dieting, is because I’ve...
So there’s this enormous body of superstition
about accomplishment and failure which has
nothing whatsoever to do with accomplish-
ment or failure. It’s merely the drift . . . . I want
you to see that in many ways you are a drift
for yourself. You have a certain drift . The tide
comes in, you go this way; the tide goes out,
you go that way. So in many ways, you your-
self are a part of the drift  for you yourself.
“
Now if this one drift s into the other one, they
impact each other. But that’s all part of the
drift , yes? Your relationships drift . They’ve got
a life of their own. Projects drift , they’ve got
a life of their own. When I’m considering the
distinction “accomplishment,” my question is,
what impacts the drift ?
“
The distinction is teased out in the subsequent dialogue between
Erhard and the seminar participants. Some of what appears here
in embryonic form would later be developed in the Being a Leader
Course (http://beingaleader.net) Erhard has developed together
with Michael Jensen (Professor Emeritus of Economics at the
Harvard Business School), Steve Zaff ron (CEO of the Vanto Group),
Kari Granger (Fellow, Center For Character and Leadership Devel-
opment, United States Air Force Academy), and Jeri Echeverria
(Professor and Provost Emerita for the California State University,
Fresno). The next sidebar presents an excerpt from the pre-course
readings for the Being a Leader Course (from 2015). ■
