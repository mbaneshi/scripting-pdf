Forum Day Four: Session Three 455
MONTY (to laughter)
I’m lost.
KIPP
Right. Yeah, it’s easy to make somebody else not be like that, therefore you can sell out. Because
if somebody has some quality, like leadership, or ability, or talent, or whatever that is, and you
don’t have that quality, that property, you get to say, “If I had that property, I would be great like
them, but since I don’t, I won’t.”
MONTY
Yeah.
KIPP
I don’t mind the interpretation “leadership,” you know, if there’s this stuff  called leadership,
except what I’ve noticed is, if you don’t have it, you’re out of luck. As long as there’s this stuff
called leadership, or skill, or talent, or ability, you’ve got to get it somewhere.
MONTY
Well that’s what I came here for.
KIPP
Exactly, or if leadership is a conversation, you’ve got access to it, don’t you? You have access to a
conversation?
MONTY
Yeah.
KIPP
Exactly. So I’m inviting you to consider that leadership or whatever it is that you see that calls
you to be is a conversation. And the conversation that you have been listening to is not worth
your life. That’s the one you’ve been honoring.
MONTY
Yeah. Good. Thanks.

When Werner was talking yesterday, or you were talking, and he talked about, if this work
“calls” to you in some way... When I participated in this work for the fi rst time thirteen years
ago, this work called to me. You know, I can remember sitting in that room in New York City,
present to that this was somehow how I knew life could be, like a possibility, really. Whether I
liked it or didn’t like it, or whether I felt like I belonged, or whether I felt like I didn’t belong,
I was called to that. It spoke to me. So I said “yes” to whatever was in front of me, and I kept
saying “yes,” and I kept saying “yes,” and I kept saying “yes.” And I’m left with a couple of
things out of this Forum for myself, and one is that...you know, I lead The Forum almost
456
SPEAKING BEING
every weekend, like you do, and I’m never not brought to my knees, like knocked out, by
what happens for people in The Forum, or really what The Forum is for people. And these
four days, sitting in this chair, in diff erent parts of the room, I saw that I had no idea what the
possibility of this Forum was, at all, in being a participant. Who walked in here four days ago
was, you know, “Yeah” to what life brings. But who’s walking out four days later is “Yes!” to
life. I don’t care what life brings me, I’m a “yes” to that. To be grateful, to be thankful, to be
blessed... I don’t know what the words are for that, but to be “yes,” to be able to be a “yes” to
life, that is the greatest gift. Thank you.
KIPP
Avril.
AVRIL
That’s what I wanted to talk about: choice.
KIPP
Good.
AVRIL
I defi nitely have my foot nailed to the fl oor in the area of choice. I’ve been trying to fi nd
satisfaction in my marriage. I’ve kind of tried all kinds of things, hoping about it, creating it. I
created it for about two weeks and that didn’t work. And about two years ago what I realized is
that what I keep doing is trying to do all this stuff  on top of “no.” And so it’s like, “oh!...”
KIPP
The clearing that you are in life is “no.” That’s what you’re saying?
AVRIL
Yes. It’s like “no” has me. And all the other stuff  is on top of that. And so then I fi nally thought,
“Okay, I got it. The choice is no!” So, I separated from my husband, and we’re both here to see
what to do about our marriage. I’ve got all the reasons to get divorced and all the reasons why
not to, and it seems like my choice is “no, I don’t want to be married.”
KIPP
These are two diff erent things. “My choice is no” and “I don’t want to be married” are distinct.
One’s a decision and one’s a choice.
AVRIL (weeping)
My choice is no, and I have this huge “should.”
KIPP
Yeah, that’s right.
