Forum Day Three: Session Four
307
ERHARD
Okay, there’s a certain part of The Forum for which you need to be less tired. I didn’t say not
tired. I said less tired, less tired than you’re going to be if I answer all your questions!
(laughter)
So we’re not going to answer any more questions tonight. Tonight we’re going to...
(after a participant shouted out: “Let’s vote.”)
Does it really make you feel good to vote?
(laughter)
What about “The rug is red? Yeah!”
(laughter)
If you like voting why don’t you vote on stuff  like that? “Yeah! This rug is red! Yeah!”
(clapping with everyone else joining in)
So, we’re not going to keep you up with answering questions, we’re going to keep you up with
an assignment. Stay up at home.
KIPP
Between tonight and tomorrow morning your assignment is to get clear that life is empty and
meaningless. So what you’re going to come up against between tonight and tomorrow morning
is all those places that you say have...
(the group shouts back: “meaning”)
And you’re going to inquire into those to see that they are...
(the group shouts: “meaningless”)
ERHARD
One other thing is to look at where they’ve made it mean something that life is empty and
meaningless. Particularly add that in there.
KIPP
The second part: what you’ve made it mean that life is empty and meaningless. Therefore...
There is also an invitation: to share what’s been opening up for you with people in your life. Get
clear that life is empty and meaningless. And what have you made it mean that life is empty
and meaningless?
The third day of The Forum concluded.

SPEAKING BEING
The Forgetting of Being, Part Six of Eight: Saying Nothing
The bundle of concepts associated with non-Being and the negative—emptiness,
meaninglessness, nothingness, nihilism—are of central significance in understand-
ing the rhetorical movement of The Forum. They are likewise fundamental in the
work of Martin Heidegger; and are deeply embedded in the perspective of Zen, an-
other major influence on Werner Erhard’s thinking. According to the Japanese schol-
ar Masao Abe, who has written extensively about the relationship of Zen to Western
thinking, “Martin Heidegger takes the issue of ‘nothingness’ not only with utmost
seriousness, but perhaps with the most profundity in Western history” (Maseo Abe,
Zen and Western Thought 134). For both Heidegger and Erhard, a transformative
ontological event—an experience of Being (of what it means “to be”)—demands an
authentic encounter with Being’s other side; and a conversation that aims to evoke
such an encounter makes special demands, since, says Heidegger, “there is, aft er all,
something peculiar about Nothing” (IM 30).
We cannot overstate the importance of this element in Erhard’s work. Central to
his achievement has been the development of a rhetorical structure—manifested in
both the est Training and The Forum—that consistently provides participants with
an experience of nothingness as a liberating context for their lives. The experience
is evoked by a progression of ontological distinctions, generated in speaking by
the Forum leader and developed dialogically with the participants. What is made
present in the dialogue—heard, though unsaid—is Being; and its presencing occurs
in a particularly dramatic way. One of Heidegger’s central claims is that an experi-
ence of Being must be preceded by an experience of Being’s other side, nonbeing,
which Heidegger called the Nothing. Human existence, he says, means “being held
out into the nothing” (“WM” in BW 103). This requires that one open oneself to an
experience of meaninglessness, an experience that one may encounter in moments
of anxiety, despair, or profound boredom—moments when the meaning of life drops
away, and one confronts existence nakedly, without the familiar comforts of one’s
personal identity. Human beings, says Erhard, are addicted to their identities, and
an addiction cannot be dealt with eff ectively until the addict has “hit bottom.” But
for Forum participants, most of whom have achieved a comfortable level of personal
and professional success, such an experience may never arise—without assistance.
Therefore the function of The Forum is to “raise the bottom” so that participants hit
it; and where this happens is in the confrontation with the Nothing, as the conversa-
tion’s penultimate distinction.
