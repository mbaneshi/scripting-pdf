SPEAKING BEING
Erhard entered at the side of the room, wearing a brown sweater-vest and gray-brown slacks.
He stood in the back, listening, looking around the room, occasionally greeting and touching a
participant.
KIPP
That’s a big one. See, when you can’t be with what’s happening, what you’re always left with is
force, no power.
MARGARET
That’s it.
KIPP
Okay. Thank you very much.
(applause)
Clear on the empty and meaninglessness that life is, or the meaning you’ve given to the empty
and meaningless. One of those two.
JEB
I woke this morning and realized I am the sum total of my likes and dislikes, that’s all I
am. I am the sum total of my likes and dislikes, no more than that.
KIPP
Yes, so, if you take a person’s life, and you put all their opinions in a jar, and you stick them in
the jar with it, that’s their life. What they like and what they don’t like; what they agree with
and what they don’t agree with; what they think is good, and what they think is bad; what they
think is right and what they think is wrong.
ERHARD
Is it possible to get some insight into how stupid that is? The signifi cance with which we have
given to what we like and don’t like, with what you agree and don’t agree with, with what you
want and don’t want? Is it possible to get some insight into how trivial and trivializing that is
to your life? I told you I would tell you about the spiritual exercise. You have to do the spiritual
exercise at night, because it has to be dark out, and it has to be clear out so that you can see
the stars. Here in San Francisco that isn’t always easy, but sometimes. Go down to the beach
at about two or three in the morning when there’s nobody there, and look up at the sky, at the
stars. When you get over the awe—and we always do, don’t we?—as soon as you get over the
awe, what you do is you watch the stars very, very, very carefully. You have to watch them very
carefully. Watch the stars very carefully while you tell the stars your opinions, what you don’t
like and what you do like, what you agree with and what you don’t agree with, and particularly
tell them what you want and what you don’t want. If you’ve watched them very carefully, at the
Forum Day Four: Session One

end of that exercise, you will be in touch with, you will have a deep insight into the profound
indiff erence the universe has for your opinion.
(laughter)
And then you can do something else with your life instead of fi guring out what you agree with
and what you don’t agree with. That would give you a lot of time, because right now you are
spending a lot of time fi guring out what you agree with and what you don’t agree with, and what
you like and what you don’t like, and what you want and what you don’t want. Very important to
know that the stars won’t move for your opinions. They will not move. They’ll move for some-
thing, but not for your opinion. And you’re pretty stuck with your opinion. You know, with what
you think is right and what you think is wrong, and which way you think it ought to be done and
which way you don’t think it ought to be done. You watch the stars carefully, like I said, you will
have a profound insight into the awesome indiff erence with which the universe holds your opin-
ion. Then you can use your life for something else. The stars will move, but not for your opinion.
Very good what you said. Thank you for letting me interrupt you. Please go on.
JEB
It gave me an opportunity to observe myself doing it because it came in the context of empty
and meaningless, and so I could retrace the steps. Like this: “Life is empty and meaningless.
Okay I could see the value in that. It gives you the freedom you spoke of, all of those things. I
can like that idea.” So what I saw happen was, I could incorporate that without challenging the
structure of my life. I could make that something I like, give it that meaning without upsetting
the way I do business.
KIPP
You see what he’s saying? It can be absorbed into the conventional wisdom. It would be an
extension of what you already knew. If you put this as an extension of what you already know,
it will be more of what you already know. Very powerful what Jeb is saying. “Oh, yeah, I agree
that it’s empty and meaningless. And of course, when I don’t agree with it, it won’t be.” See, you
don’t have any wants. You are your wants. Somebody tries to take your wants away from you,
you will act like they are trying to take you away from you. Yes?
WALKER
I got that I am complete with my mother but not with my father. And I began to look at that
and I saw that I thought that my father owed me something. Who I’d been being with my father
was that he owed me something. I called him up during the meal break last night, and just
apologized for being somebody who thought that he owed me something. And he said, “Well
what is it you thought I owed you.” And I said that I couldn’t even think of it, but that I just
wanted to apologize for that. He said: “apology accepted.” And that was that, and afterwards I
began to see that the other side of that is that if who I’ve been being is that he owes me some-
thing... the other side of that is that I’ve been being someone who owes somebody something. I
have something to complete with you, Werner. In 1974, I couldn’t say it then, but what I got was
what my life could be about. Everything since then has been about how I could pay you back,
The Uncanny
Approaching the final stages of writing this book, the authors
also were faced with another “end”: in January of 2015, Bruce
Hyde, the senior author, was diagnosed with a recurring and
aggressive cancer. A new urgency emerged, as the very existence
of our project was called into question. The “end” itself was
addressing us, calling us, summoning forth a whole new clearing
for partnership and activity, and in that clearing this book in its
entirety emerged with the senior author free to complete the
remainder of the sidebars and intervals, doing so before he was
unable to participate any longer.
320
SPEAKING BEING
like in order to pay you back for this gift you’ve given me. And what I got yesterday is that I
don’t owe you anything. I owe you nothing. And you’ve always told me “you owe me nothing.”
But I couldn’t quite get that without this piece of it. And now I’m wholly complete with that I
owe you nothing. And I am complete that I am participating in this work to pay you back for
something or in order to something...
ERHARD
You can’t give when you owe. Paying back is not a very powerful expression. Giving is a more
powerful expression than paying back.
WALKER
So we’re even.
ERHARD  (to laughter)
Deal. By the way I didn’t say I owed you nothing. I said I promised you nothing. It’s a
throwaway.
WALKER
In a very real way, who you have been being for me is my father. Like trying to get something
from you, trying to pay something back to you. So I want to thank you for the opportunity to be
in The Forum and the opportunity to complete that.
ERHARD
Thank you.
KIPP
See, participation begins when you have no reason to participate. What you call participation
has always been in-order-to... That’s not participation. That’s some kind of entanglement. Some
kind of a deal, strategy, tactic—not participation: Can you even imagine participating for no
reason?
ERHARD
You can’t imagine anything for no reason. You really can’t imagine anything for no reason. You
know it sounds like we keep insulting you, like when I told somebody they haven’t lived yet.
Insulting, right? Except everything in the world for you is in-order-to, and nothing is for itself:
that’s not to have lived yet. If everything is in-order-to, you’ve never gotten anything for itself,
you know, the thing itself, as itself. Like another person as that other person; not the other
person in-order-to. It’s a very diff erent context. Remember what we said about “tall” and the
context in which “tall” shows up? Other people in-order-to don’t look like other people as them-
selves. Even a tree in-order-to does not look like a tree as a tree. Love in-order-to is not love, it’s
something else: It’s called love in-order-to. It’s not love. People who only know love in-order-to,
do not know what love is.
In Being and Time, Heidegger has shed light on this
phenomenon, which has gained special significance given
our recent encounter with the most implacable of limits. For
Heidegger, this call reaches Dasein and turns it toward its end,
toward the possibility of its impossibility, the Nothing. Anxiety
then is the correlative attunement in which the call is heard—at
that moment when we find our limit. It is in this attunement that
Being-in-the-world is disclosed as entirely unrecognizable within
any familiar rubric. Thus, the call of conscience cannot be said.
It comes from a strange, unrecognizable domain. The call, when
heard, is uncanny (Unheimlich).
What is the Uncanny?
For Heidegger, uncanniness refers to the human relation to death,
to the possibility of our non-existence, and our tendency to
flee from an authentic confrontation with Being-towards-
the-end. This tendency to flee is not surprising, given “the
everyday publicness of the ‘they,’ which brings tranquillized
self-assurance—‘Being-at-home,’ with all its obviousness—into
the average everydayness of Dasein” (BT 233).
T
In an authentic
confrontation, for instance, here in Session One of Day Four of
The Forum, even “as Dasein falls, anxiety brings it back from its
absorption in the ‘world.’ Everyday familiarity collapses. Dasein
has been individualized, but individualized as Being-in-the-
world” (BT 233). Everything that had heretofore supported the
T
self-understood existence that constituted our self falls away.
There is no “you” there, nor is there an “I”; only Being-in-the-

(to Kipp)
Did you ever get to reasonableness?
KIPP
No.
ERHARD
Were you planning on doing that today?
KIPP
Exactly.
ERHARD
Great. Raphaela?
RAPHAELA
When I was thinking of standing up, I was wanting to participate in-order-to. And life is
meaningless to me is really... I’m stuck. I want this coaching, I want to accept that, but if it’s
meaningless to me then what does that mean? I keep going in that circle.
ERHARD
Yeah, what does it mean that it’s meaningless and empty?
RAPHEAELA
Exactly. But for me to say that, I don’t... I’m still not accepting it. So, so what?
KIPP
You’ve made not accepting it mean something also. You know, like you should accept it.
RAPHAELA
Well, I follow what you’re saying...
KIPP
You mean you can see that accepting and not accepting are both meaningless. They both mean
the same thing. One means accepting and the other means not accepting.
RAPHAELA
Yeah. But at the same time I feel my racket coming up saying “I can’t accept that.”
ERHARD
What’s your racket?
world. “This is it” says Erhard. “You wanted to know how it was
going to turn out. Well this is it. This is how it turned out” (“Heart
of the Matter”). Inevitably, Being-in-the-world “enters into the
existential ‘mode’ of the ‘not-at-home’” (BT 233). This sense of not-
at-homeness is what is referred to as the uncanny.
Over the last several months, as the senior author has
become more open in his thinking, as well as in conversation,
to his own death as something impending, he has begun
to experience this uncanniness. And while letting go to this
confrontation has certainly included a quality of danger—the
discomfort of being on the edge, of jumping off the high diving
board, of being ungrounded—there has also been an experience
of great liberation regarding the tendency to flee given by the
“rainstorm” of the “they” self, which “does not permit us the
courage for anxiety in the face of death” (BT 298). Heidegger
T
continues:
As falling, everyday Being-towards-death is
a constant fleeing in the face of death. Being-
towards-the-end has the mode of evasion
in the face of it—giving new explanations
for it, understanding it inauthentically, and
concealing it. Factically one’s own Dasein is
always dying already; that is to say, it is in a
Being-towards-its-end. And it hides this Fact
from itself by recoining “death” as just a “case
of death” in Others—an everyday occurrence
which, if need be, gives us the assurance still
more plainly that ‘oneself’ is still ‘living.’
(BT 298
T
)
“
One might read in Heidegger’s words a degree of disparagement
toward the everyday way of Being-in-the-world endemic to the
“they” self. Perhaps Heidegger is attempting to lay bare everyday-
ness such that his readers might hear the call of conscience that
itself brings us to face a profound lack present in the tranquil life
dictated by the “they”:
322
SPEAKING BEING
RAPHAELA
My racket is that I won’t make a decision. So, to work that racket I make a decision for me and
I make a decision for everyone else and the decision I’m making is that I can’t accept that. And
I’m standing up here now because I have been participating “in-order-to,” so it’s not participat-
ing, it’s not sharing: Whatever I say, it’s coming out as in-order-to.
ERHARD
Like you can’t get out of that, can you? Everything you do is in-order-to; you can’t get out of
the trap. You try to get out of the trap, it gets you in the trap because trying to get out of the
trap... you’re doing what you’re doing to get out of the trap. And if you succumb to the trap,
you’re stuck in the trap. There’s no way out of the trap. It’s called being human. There’s no way
out of being human. The only thing you’ve got is to accept it; not accept like give in, but accept
like own, like be responsible for, like embrace. It’s called embracing yourself. You read it in
books: It’s called loving yourself or accepting yourself. Nobody knows what that means. People
think “loving yourself” is some zzzzzt thing. No. It’s what we’re talking about in here. We’ve
kind of got it fl ayed open so you can see it. It’s owning that you’re always in-order-to; that every
time you operate you’re operating out of your racket; and any attempt to operate with some-
thing other than your racket is another racket. It’s rackets all the way down... to the bottom.
At the bottom you get to empty and meaningless. That’s not a racket. Empty and meaningless
is worthless. It’s not good for anything. Empty and meaningless doesn’t make you right and it
doesn’t make anything wrong, and it doesn’t help you to dominate anything or avoid domination.
It doesn’t justify anything. And on top of that, all there is, is rackets and in-order-tos. And
that’s why it doesn’t make any diff erence whether you accept it or not. So you don’t accept that
it’s empty and meaningless? So what? It’s still empty and meaningless—except that it’s empty
and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless. Doesn’t make any diff erence. Still doesn’t
mean anything that it’s empty and meaningless. And if you did accept it, so what? Still empty
and meaningless. Doesn’t help when you accept it. Doesn’t go away. Doesn’t get fi xed. Still
empty and meaningless and it’s still empty and meaningless that it is empty and meaningless.
You see? Like that. What else?
RAPHAELA
Yesterday when we went through the fear experience...
ERHARD
That wasn’t fear, that was the danger exercise. You all will call it fear. That’s what you call it;
we call it the danger exercise.
(to Kipp)
Did you call it fear?
KIPP
Absolutely not.
The “they” gives its approval, and aggravates
the temptation to cover up from oneself one’s
ownmost Being-towards-death. This evasive
concealment in the face of death dominates
everydayness so stubbornly that, in Being with
one another, the ‘neighbors’ oft en still keep
talking the ‘dying person’ into the belief that
he will escape death and soon return to the
tranquillized everydayness of the world of his
concern. Such ‘solicitude’ is meant to ‘console’
him. [. . .] In this manner the “they” provides
a constant tranquillization about death. At
bottom, however, this is a tranquillization not
only for him who is ‘dying’ but just as much for
those who ‘console’ him. (BT 297–298
T
)
“
Following the familiar flight away from the nothing, and listening
away to the “they” self, we might easily conclude that people
don’t die. They pass. Yes, the euphemism is apt; certainly death is
a passage. At the same time, more openness and authenticity in
this realm is a worthy goal. Uncanny conversation is not morbid; it
only reveals that we are in an essential state of lack. We are to our
core striving to live practice lives designed to allow us to escape,
designed to relieve us of the anxiety that calls out from the
Nothing, reminding us that we are thrown to be what we already
and always are, human beings, meaning making machines, an
existence and facticity—the trap—from which there is no escape
other than to be in the trap. ■
Forum Day Four: Session One
323
(laughter)
ERHARD
Okay good. Raphaela?
RAPHAELA
That’s my story, when we went through the fear process: I found myself angry because all these
people were acting the way they were and then I saw that I was going through this process of I
couldn’t be whatever it was I was going to be because I was angry with these people for making
these really fucking weird noises. Distracting me: “Come on, shut up and let me be who I am,”
you know.
(laughing)
ERHARD
Why are they laughing? Do you know?
RAPHAELA
It’s really silly.
ERHARD
And also there’s a certain recognition. People laugh when they recognize themselves in other
people. Like when you said the king has no clothes, everybody laughed, right? Because they
saw it all along but nobody had said it.
RAPHAELA
So right now I’m working on trying to understand the not having meaning in my life, because for
so long it’s been “there has to be a meaning,” “there has to be a purpose,” you know, you do things
in-order-to. And it’s really hard for me to get off  that because, my story is that’s what my parents
have taught me. And the real truth is that they raised me, they fed me, and they loved me, but I
get...
KIPP
The truth is you’re a human being, and that’s what you get with being human. That’s what
you get when you get here and the party’s over. You get the kind of being that gives everything
meaning. And what you’re doing is thrashing around inside the trap. Flailing around. Well if it
doesn’t mean anything, what does that mean?
RAPHAELA
Well, I now say... I hear that it doesn’t mean anything, so how do I get out of that trap, which is
a trap in itself?
At 9:45, Wes entered and joined Kipp in this interaction.
324
SPEAKING BEING
WES  (to Raphaela)
Did you ever see Chinese handcuff s? You stick your fi ngers in them.
RAPHAELA
No.
WES
So imagine this gadget where you put your index fi ngers on either side of it, and then you go to
pull your fi ngers out. You know what happens?
(to the group)
What happens?
(many answer together: “it tightens up”)
See, that’s your problem! You never stuck your fi ngers in a Chinese handcuff !
(laughter)
So you’re going to have to make this up. You stick your fi ngers in this thing. You pull on it and
then it tightens. Can you get that?
RAPHAELA
Yeah.
WES
And then you pull on it more and it tightens. And the harder you pull to get your fi ngers out,
the tighter it gets. Can you get that? That’s what’s happening right now. You are in a giant Chi-
nese handcuff . How do you like it? It’s called your life.
RAPHAELA
I don’t like it.
WES
Good. That’s the fi rst recognition. If that makes any diff erence.
RAPHAELA
I don’t like to be wrong and for me being in a Chinese handcuff  is being able to be right.
WES
Yeah, it’s not a matter of being wrong. It’s just a matter of it doesn’t work. Not for someone who
wants to live their life. Either way you’re going to die, so it’s just a conversation right now. But
someday you’ll be dead and they’ll put on your tombstone: “lived her life fully,” or they’ll put
there something like “tried to get out of the trap, and died...”
Forum Day Four: Session One
325
KIPP
...”in the trap.”
WES
So you want to know how you get out of the trap?
RAPHAELA
Well, I think...
WES
Do you want to know how to get out of the trap?
RAPHAELA
No.
WES
That’s the problem. So you should sit down with the understanding that you don’t want to get
out of the trap and then that’s at least clear between us. And you won’t complain about it. The
rest of your life, when you notice it’s not working and it’s trapped and your trapped and things
are kind of dead, and you’re not getting off  on things, and you’re bitching and moaning about
complaining about things and the people around you are bitchers and moaners and complain-
ers—all friends—then that’ll be okay with you because you took a stand in The Forum that
you prefer that.
(long pause)
RAPHAELA
My racket prefers that, I think, because who I am is not...
WES
Do you want to get out of the trap?
RAPHAELA
Yes.
WES
Let me tell you how to get out of the trap. Are you willing to listen?
RAPHAELA
I’m willing to listen.
326
SPEAKING BEING
WES
Great. Stop trying to get out of the trap. That’s how you get out of the trap. You stop trying to
get out of the trap; just stay in the trap. You accept the trap. Then your relationship to the trap
transforms. Look: Stay with this because this is important for everybody else. See the fl oor?
Okay.
(pacing back and forth)
I’m just doing whatever I’m doing right now, right? And in terms of my ability to go through
reality right now, there’s no problem, right? But there’s a fl oor there, okay? I want you to imag-
ine that I had an argument with the fl oor being there. Okay? I’m going to show you what that’s
like.
(looking back and forth down at the fl oor)
What the hell is that fl oor doing down there? This is the stupidest fl oor I’ve ever seen. My
mother doesn’t like this fl oor. I don’t like it. It should be a foot higher. Who was the stupid per-
son who put this fl oor here? They’ve got to change this right now.
(to Raphaela)
You see where I am in relation to this fl oor? I’m stuck with it. I’m in an argument and a com-
plaint about this fl oor. I’m not accepting the fl oor. This fl oor is wrong. Not okay. It ought to be
diff erent. I should change it. It’s a problem and I’m totally stuck with the stupid fl oor. What it
takes to transform my relationship with the fl oor is to let it be the fl oor as it is. And then the
fl oor and I get along perfectly well. And nothing’s changed. The fl oor is still there. So that’s an
analogy to your relationship to your racket. You know, if you can let your racket be, it’ll give
you some possibility of being. The way you let your racket be is you realize that it’s empty and
meaningless. Your racket’s designed to add meaning to everything. It doesn’t mean anything.
RAPHAELA
I got that.
WES
Good. You’re now up to date with The Forum. Congratulations.
After the applause, Kipp called on a participant named Kenneth.
KENNETH
I thought I had a lot of this fi gured out because I took the training. I also thought I had it fi g-
ured out that there’s no meaning because I gave up religion. I’m a native Californian.
(laughter)
I’ve had a lot of attachments to the way things ought to be. My karma is like my religion. I
didn’t even see that. I thought I was really clear with things. I have a huge trap. I have a savior
complex. In my line of work I’ve seen a lot of people with savior complexes. That’s my schtick.
Forum Day Four: Session One
327
Probably a lot of people here can identify with that. I’ve noticed a lot of tears. I’ve been identi-
fying and commiserating with a lot of people. What I tell myself is that I’m crying for me. I’m
very selfi sh. And what I thought I heard Werner say yesterday was “Get off  it.” And that really
scares me.
KIPP
What does that mean, it really scares you to get off  it?
KENNETH
Well I just lost my job. I’m about to lose my marriage. I think I just lost the house I was going
to buy.
KIPP
You mean you got fi red?
KENNETH
Yes.
KIPP
You don’t lose jobs. You lose keys, right?
KENNETH  (laughter)
Right. My story is I got laid off . I really got fi red.
KIPP
Got it.
KENNETH
It feels good to say that. I’ve got a long history of “poor me” and boy that’s fucking me.
KIPP
No, it’s poor me-ing you. Poor me is poor me; not poor me is not poor me. They both mean the
same thing: nothing.
KENNETH
Yes. I almost got to the point where I can laugh about that.
KIPP
Careful, don’t. It’ll be a shock to your system.
KENNETH
Right. And when I was looking at...

Erhard در کنار اتاق وارد شد و یک پیراهن های ژاکت قهوه ای و خاکستری قهوه ای را پوشید. او در پشت ایستاده بود ، گوش می داد ، به اتاق نگاه می کرد ، گاهی اوقات سلام می کرد و لمس می کرد

این فرصتی به من داد تا خودم را رعایت کنم زیرا در متن خالی آمده است

فهمیدم که با مادرم کامل هستم اما با پدرم نیست. و من شروع به نگاه کردن به آن کردم
و دیدم که فکر کردم پدرم چیزی به من بدهکار است. که من با پدرم بوده ام
این بود که او به من چیزی بدهکار بود. دیشب در هنگام استراحت غذا به او زنگ زدم و فقط
عذرخواهی کرد که کسی بود که فکر می کرد چیزی به من بدهکار است. و او گفت ، "خوب
فکر کردم من به شما بدهکار هستم. " و من گفتم که حتی نمی توانم به آن فکر کنم ، اما من فقط هستم

ببینید ، مشارکت از زمانی شروع می شود که دلیلی برای شرکت در آن ندارید. آنچه شما مشارکت می نامید
همیشه به صورت نظم بوده است ... این مشارکت نیست. این نوعی گرفتاری است. برخی
نوع معامله ، استراتژی ، تاکتیک - مشارکت نه: آیا حتی می توانید تصور کنید که برای NO شرکت کنید
دلیل؟ درز
شما بدون هیچ دلیلی نمی توانید چیزی را تصور کنید. شما واقعاً نمی توانید هیچ دلیلی تصور کنید. شما
بدانید که به نظر می رسد که ما به شما توهین می کنیم ، مثل وقتی که به کسی گفتم که آنها هنوز زندگی نکرده اند. توهین ، درست است؟ به جز همه چیز در جهان برای شما به صورت نظم است و هیچ چیز برای خودش نیست:
این هنوز زندگی نکرده است. اگر همه چیز به صورت سفارش است ، شما هرگز چیزی برای خود بدست نیاوردید ،
شما می دانید ، خود چیز ، به عنوان خودش. مانند شخص دیگری مانند آن شخص دیگر ؛ نه دیگر
شخص در سفارش این یک زمینه بسیار متفاوت است. آنچه را که در مورد "قد بلند" و
زمینه ای که در آن "بلند" ظاهر می شود؟ افراد دیگر به صورت نظم به نظر نمی رسند-
خود حتی یک درخت در مرتبه-مانند درخت به نظر نمی رسد. عشق به ترتیب عشق نیست ، این است
چیز دیگری: به آن عشق در سفارش داده می شود. این عشق نیست افرادی که فقط عشق را می شناسند ،
نمی دانم عشق چیست. در وجود و زمان ، هایدگر این موضوع را روشن کرده است
پدیده ، که اهمیت ویژه ای کسب کرده است
برخورد اخیر ما با محدود ترین محدودیت ها. برای
هایدگر ، این تماس به داسین می رسد و آن را به سمت پایان خود می چرخاند ،
به سمت امکان غیرممکن بودن آن ، هیچ چیز. اضطراب
آنگاه همبستگی همبستگی که در آن تماس شنیده می شود - در
آن لحظه که حد خود را پیدا می کنیم. در این محاصره است که
بودن در جهان به عنوان کاملاً غیرقابل تشخیص در درون فاش می شود
هر موضوع آشنا بنابراین ، ندای وجدان نمی توان گفت. این از یک دامنه عجیب و غیرقابل تشخیص است. تماس ، چه زمانی
شنیده می شود ، Uncanny (unhimlich) است. Uncanny چیست؟ برای هایدگر ، ناآرامی به رابطه انسانی با مرگ اشاره دارد ،
به احتمال عدم وجود ما و تمایل ما به
فرار از یک رویارویی معتبر با quards بودن-
پایان این تمایل به فرار با توجه به ""

عالی رافائلا؟ رافالا
وقتی فکر می کردم ایستاده باشم ، می خواستم شرکت کنم. و زندگی است
برای من بی معنی است واقعاً ... من گیر کرده ام. من این مربیگری را می خواهم ، می خواهم آن را بپذیرم ، اما اگر چنین باشد
برای من بی معنی است پس این به چه معنی است؟ من به آن حلقه ادامه می دهم. درز
بله ، این بدان معنی است که بی معنی و خالی است؟ رافیالا
دقیقاً اما برای من این که بگویم ، من ... من هنوز آن را نمی پذیرم. خوب ، پس چه؟ کله
شما آن را قبول نکرده اید که به معنای چیزی نیز نیست. شما می دانید ، مثل اینکه باید آن را بپذیرید. رافالا
خوب ، من آنچه را که شما می گویید دنبال می کنم ... کیپ
منظور شما این است که می بینید که پذیرش و عدم پذیرش هر دو بی معنی هستند. هر دو معنی دارند
همین موضوع یکی به معنای پذیرش و دیگری به معنای پذیرش نیست. رافالا
بله اما در همان زمان احساس می کنم راکت من در حال آمدن است که می گوید "من نمی توانم آن را بپذیرم."
درز
راکت شما چیست؟ جهان ارهارد می گوید: "این است. "شما می خواستید بدانید که چگونه بود
رفتن به معلوم شدن خوب این همین است. اینگونه معلوم شد "(" قلب
از موضوع "). به ناچار ، بودن در جهان" وارد کشور می شود
"حالت" وجودی "نه در خانه" "(BT 233)
در-بوم بودن همان چیزی است که از آن به عنوان غیرقانونی یاد می شود. طی چند ماه گذشته ، همانطور که نویسنده ارشد دارد
در تفکر او و همچنین در مکالمه بازتر شوید ،
به مرگ خودش به عنوان چیزی قریب الوقوع ، او آغاز شده است
برای تجربه این ناآرامی. و در حالی که رها می شوید به این کار بروید
تقابل مطمئناً شامل کیفیت خطر است -
ناراحتی از بودن در لبه ، پریدن از غواصی زیاد
هیئت مدیره ، بی اساس بودن - تجربه ای نیز وجود داشته است
از آزادی بزرگ در مورد تمایل به فرار توسط
"طوفان باران" از خود "آنها" ، که "به ما اجازه نمی دهد
شجاعت اضطراب در مقابل مرگ »(BT 298). هایدگر
حرف
ادامه:
همانطور که در حال سقوط است ، هر روز که در حال مرگ است
فرار مداوم در مقابل مرگ. وجود-
به سمت پایان حالت فرار دارد
در مواجهه با آن - توضیحات جدید
برای آن ، درک آن به طور غیرقانونی ، و
پنهان کردن آن به طور واقعی Dasein خود شخص است
همیشه در حال مرگ است یعنی در یک
در حال Towards-it-end. و این واقعیت را پنهان می کند
از خود با بازخوانی "مرگ" به عنوان "پرونده"
مرگ "در دیگران - یک اتفاق روزمره
که در صورت نیاز ، هنوز اطمینان را به ما می دهد
به طور واضح تر اینکه "خود" هنوز "زندگی می کند".

ممکن است کسی در سخنان هایدگر درجه ای از ناهماهنگی بخواند
به سمت روش روزمره بودن در جهان بومی به
"آنها" خود. شاید هایدگر در تلاش باشد تا هر روز لخت کند-
به گونه ای که خوانندگانش ممکن است تماس وجدان را بشنوند
خود ما را برای مواجهه با فقدان عمیقی در زندگی آرامش بخش می آورد

راکت من این است که من تصمیمی نمی گیرم. بنابراین ، برای کار در آن راکت ، من برای من تصمیم می گیرم و
من برای همه افراد تصمیم می گیرم و تصمیمی که می گیرم این است که نمی توانم آن را بپذیرم. وت
من الان اینجا ایستاده ام زیرا من در "سفارش" شرکت کرده ام ، بنابراین این شرکت کننده نیست-
این به اشتراک نمی گذارد: هر آنچه که من می گویم ، به صورت نظم به نمایش در می آید. درز
مثل اینکه نمی توانید از آن خارج شوید ، می توانید؟ هر کاری که انجام می دهید به صورت نظم است. شما نمی توانید از خارج شوید
تله شما سعی می کنید از تله خارج شوید ، شما را در تله قرار می دهد زیرا تلاش برای خارج شدن از
تله ... شما کاری را که انجام می دهید برای خارج شدن از تله انجام می دهید. و اگر به دام تسلیم شوید ،
شما در دام گیر کرده اید. هیچ راهی برای خارج شدن از دام وجود ندارد. آن را انسان بودن می نامند. هیچ راهی وجود ندارد
از انسان بودن تنها چیزی که به دست آورده اید این است که آن را بپذیرید. قبول نکنید مانند تسلیم شدن ، اما قبول کنید
مانند خود ، مانند مسئولیت پذیری ، مانند آغوش. این خود را در آغوش می گیرد. شما آن را خوانده اید
کتاب ها: به آن دوست داشتن خود یا پذیرش خودتان گفته می شود. هیچ کس نمی داند این به چه معنی است. مردم
فکر کنید "دوست داشتن خود" چیز zzzzzt است. نه. این همان چیزی است که ما در اینجا صحبت می کنیم. ما
نوع آن را باز کرد تا بتوانید آن را ببینید. این صاحب این است که شما همیشه به ترتیب در اختیار شما قرار می گیرید. که هر
زمان کار شما در خارج از راکت خود کار می کنید. و هر تلاشی برای کار با برخی
چیزی غیر از راکت شما راکت دیگری است. این همه راه پایین است ... تا پایین. در پایین شما به خالی و بی معنی می رسید. این یک راکت نیست خالی و بی معنی
بی ارزش است برای هر چیزی خوب نیست خالی و بی معنی شما را درست نمی کند و
هیچ مشکلی ایجاد نمی کند ، و به شما کمک نمی کند تا بر هر چیزی مسلط شوید یا از سلطه خودداری کنید. این چیزی را توجیه نمی کند. مهمتر از آن ، همه چیز وجود دارد ، راکت ها و سفارشات داخلی است. وت
به همین دلیل هیچ مشکلی ایجاد نمی کند که آیا آن را قبول می کنید یا نه. بنابراین شما آن را قبول نمی کنید
خالی و بی معنی است؟ پس چی؟ هنوز خالی و بی معنی است - به جز اینکه خالی باشد
و بی معنی است که خالی و بی معنی است. هیچ مشکلی ایجاد نمی کند. هنوز اینگونه نیست
به معنای هر چیزی که خالی و بی معنی باشد. و اگر آن را قبول کردید ، پس چه؟ هنوز خالی
و بی معنی وقتی آن را قبول می کنید کمکی نمی کنید. دور نمی شود fi xed نمی شود. هنوز
خالی و بی معنی است و هنوز خالی و بی معنی است که خالی و بی معنی است. می بینی؟ مثل این چه چیز دیگری؟ رافالا
دیروز که تجربه ترس را پشت سر گذاشتیم ... erhard
این ترس نبود ، این تمرین خطر بود. همه شما آن را ترس می نامید. این همان چیزی است که شما آن را صدا می کنید.
ما آن را تمرین خطر می نامیم. (به KIPP)
آیا آن را ترس خواندید؟ کله
مطلقاً نه "آنها" تأیید خود را می دهند و تشدید می کنند
وسوسه برای پوشاندن خود
خودشان بیشترین چیزی را برای مرگ و میر دارند. این گریزان
پنهان کردن در مواجهه با مرگ حاکم است
روزمره آنقدر سرسختانه که در بودن
یکدیگر ، "همسایگان" که هنوز هم نگه می دارند
صحبت کردن با "فرد در حال مرگ" به این اعتقاد که
او از مرگ فرار خواهد کرد و به زودی به
روزمره آرامش بخش دنیای او
نگرانی چنین "حلالیت" به معنای "کنسول" است
او [ بشر .] به این روش "آنها" ارائه می دهند
آرامش مداوم در مورد مرگ. در
با این حال ، پایین ، این یک آرامش نیست
فقط برای او که "در حال مرگ" است اما به همان اندازه
کسانی که او را "کنسول" می کنند. (BT 297–298
حرف
)
"
به دنبال پرواز آشنا به دور از هیچ چیز و گوش دادن
دور به خود "آنها" ، ممکن است به راحتی نتیجه بگیریم که مردم
بمیرید آنها عبور می کنند. بله ، حسن نیت است. مطمئناً مرگ است
یک گذرگاه در عین حال ، باز بودن و اصالت بیشتر در
این قلمرو یک هدف ارزشمند است. مکالمه غیرمجاز مرموز نیست. من
فقط نشان می دهد که ما در یک فقدان اساسی قرار داریم. ما به خودمان هستیم
تلاش اصلی برای زندگی زندگی طراحی شده است که به ما امکان فرار می دهد ،
طراحی شده برای رهایی ما از اضطراب که از آن فراخوانی می کند
هیچ چیز ، به ما یادآوری می کند که ما را به عنوان همان چیزی که قبلاً هستیم ، پرتاب می کنیم
و همیشه ، انسان ، به معنای ساخت ماشین ، یک
وجود و واقعیت - دام - از آن که هیچ فراری وجود ندارد
غیر از این که در تله باشید. ■

خوب خوب رافائلا؟ رافالا
این داستان من است ، وقتی ما روند ترس را پشت سر گذاشتیم: من خودم را عصبانی کردم زیرا همه اینها
مردم به همان شکلی که بودند عمل می کردند و بعد دیدم که این روند من را طی می کنم
نمی توانم هر آنچه که من قرار داشتم باشم زیرا از این افراد عصبانی شدم
این صداهای عجیب و غریب واقعاً لعنتی. حواس پرتی من: "بیا ، ساکت شو
می دانید (خنده)
درز
چرا آنها می خندند؟ آیا می دانید؟ رافالا
واقعاً احمقانه است درز
و همچنین یک شناخت خاص وجود دارد. مردم وقتی خود را در دیگران می شناسند می خندند
مردم مثل وقتی گفتید که پادشاه لباس ندارد ، همه خندیدند ، درست است؟ چون آنها
این همه را دیدم اما هیچ کس آن را نگفته بود. رافالا
بنابراین در حال حاضر من در حال تلاش برای درک عدم معنی در زندگی خود هستم ، زیرا برای
تا مدتهاست که "باید معنی داشته باشد" ، "باید یک هدف وجود داشته باشد" ، می دانید ، شما کارهایی انجام می دهید
در سفارش و این برای من واقعاً سخت است زیرا داستان من این همان چیزی است که والدین من
به من آموخته اند و حقیقت واقعی این است که آنها مرا بزرگ کردند ، مرا تغذیه کردند و مرا دوست داشتند ، اما من
دریافت ... کیپ
حقیقت این است که شما یک انسان هستید ، و این همان چیزی است که شما با انسان بودن بدست می آورید. این چیزی است که
وقتی به اینجا رسیدید و مهمانی تمام می شوید. شما نوع موجودی را می گیرید که به همه چیز می دهد
معنی و کاری که شما انجام می دهید این است که داخل تله می ریزید. در اطراف خوب اگر
به معنای چیزی نیست ، این به چه معنی است؟ رافالا
خوب ، من اکنون می گویم ... من می شنوم که این به معنای چیزی نیست ، پس چگونه می توانم از آن دام خارج شوم ، یعنی
تله ای به خودی خود؟ در ساعت 9:45 ، وس در این تعامل وارد KIPP شد و به KIPP پیوست. 324

آیا تا به حال دستبند چینی را دیدید؟ شما به آنها می چسبید. رافالا

بنابراین این اسباب بازی را تصور کنید که در آن شاخص های خود را در هر طرف آن قرار دهید ، و سپس به آنجا می روید
فایلهای خود را بیرون بکشید. می دانید چه اتفاقی می افتد؟ (به گروه)
چه اتفاقی می افتد؟ (بسیاری با هم جواب می دهند: "این محکم می شود")
ببینید ، این مشکل شماست! شما هرگز در یک دستبند چینی دست و پنجه نرم نکردید! (خنده)
بنابراین شما باید این کار را انجام دهید. شما در این مورد به این چیزها می چسبید. شما آن را می کشید و
سپس محکم می شود. آیا می توانید آن را بدست آورید؟ رافالا
بله وهمی
و سپس آن را بیشتر می کشید و محکم می شود. و هرچه سخت تر می کشید برای بیرون کشیدن اختلافات خود ،
محکم تر می شود. آیا می توانید آن را بدست آورید؟ این همان چیزی است که در حال حاضر اتفاق می افتد شما در یک غول پیکر هستید
دستبند NESE. چگونه آن را دوست دارید؟ این زندگی شما نامیده می شود. رافالا
من آن را دوست ندارم وهمی
خوب این اولین شناخت است. اگر این مسئله تفاوت ایجاد کند. رافالا
من دوست ندارم اشتباه کنم و برای اینکه من در یک دستبند چینی باشم می تواند درست باشد. وهمی
بله ، این مسئله اشتباه نیست. این فقط مسئله ای است که کار نمی کند. نه برای کسی که
می خواهد زندگی خود را زندگی کند. در هر صورت شما می خواهید بمیرید ، بنابراین اکنون فقط یک مکالمه است. اما
روزی شما مردید و آنها سنگ قبر شما را قرار می دهند: "زندگی او را به طور کامل زندگی کرده است" ، یا آنها را قرار می دهند
چیزی مانند "سعی کرد از تله خارج شود ، و درگذشت ..."

بنابراین می خواهید بدانید که چگونه از تله خارج می شوید؟ رافالا
خوب ، من فکر می کنم ... وس
آیا می خواهید بدانید که چگونه از تله خارج شوید؟ رافالا
شماره وس
این مشکل است بنابراین شما باید با این درک که نمی خواهید بدست آورید بنشینید
خارج از تله و سپس حداقل بین ما مشخص است. و شما از آن شکایت نخواهید کرد. در
بقیه زندگی خود را ، وقتی متوجه شدید که کار نمی کند و به دام افتاده و به دام افتاده و چیزهایی
به نوعی مرده اند ، و شما از همه چیز دور نمی شوید ، و در مورد آن عوضی و ناله می کنید
شکایت از چیزها و افراد اطراف شما عوضی و ناله و شکایت هستند-
ers - همه دوستان - پس از آن با شما خوب خواهد بود زیرا شما در انجمن موضع گیری کردید
شما آن را ترجیح می دهید. (مکث طولانی)
رافالا
فکر می کنم راکت من ترجیح می دهد ، زیرا من هستم ... وس نیست
آیا می خواهید از دام خارج شوید؟ رافالا
بله وهمی
بگذارید به شما بگویم که چگونه از دام خارج شوید. آیا حاضرید گوش دهید؟ رافالا
من مایل به گوش دادن هستم. 326
وجود
وهمی
عالی تلاش برای خارج شدن از تله را متوقف کنید. اینگونه است که شما از دام خارج می شوید. شما از تلاش خود دست بردارید
از دام خارج شوید. فقط در دام بمانید. شما تله را می پذیرید. سپس رابطه شما با تله
دگرگون می شود. نگاه کنید: با این امر بمانید زیرا این برای همه افراد مهم است. Fl Oor را می بینید؟ خوب (قدم زدن به جلو و عقب)
من فقط هر کاری را که الان انجام می دهم انجام می دهم ، درست است؟ و از نظر توانایی من برای عبور
واقعیت در حال حاضر ، مشکلی نیست ، درست است؟ اما آنجا وجود دارد ، خوب؟ من می خواهم تو تصور کنی-
با این که من با حضور در آنجا بحث کردم. خوب؟ من می خواهم به شما نشان دهم که این چیست
مانند (نگاه کردن به جلو و عقب به پایین در زمین)
چه جهنمی است که آنجا در آنجا کار می کند؟ این احمقانه ترین فلای است که من تا به حال دیده ام. من
مادر این fl را دوست ندارد. من آن را دوست ندارم باید یک پا بالاتر باشد. چه کسی احمق بود
پسری که این کار را در اینجا قرار داده است؟ آنها باید همین حالا تغییر دهند. (به رافائلا)
می بینید که من در رابطه با این fl هستم؟ من با آن گیر کرده ام من در یک بحث و گفتگو هستم
در مورد این fl oor شکایت کنید. من نمی پذیرم. این فلای اشتباه است. خوب نیست باید باشد
متفاوت من باید آن را تغییر دهم این یک مشکل است و من کاملاً با احمق احمق گیر کرده ام. چه
طول می کشد تا رابطه من با fl oor را تغییر دهم این است که اجازه دهید آن را همانطور که هست ، باشد. و سپس
من و اوور کاملاً خوب پیش می رویم. و هیچ چیز تغییر نکرده است. Fl Oor هنوز آنجاست. بنابراین این یک است
قیاس با رابطه شما با راکت خود. شما می دانید ، اگر می توانید راکت خود را بگذارید ، به آن می دهد
شما برخی از احتمال وجود دارید. روشی که راکت خود را اجازه می دهید این است که شما متوجه می شوید که خالی است و
بی معنی راکت شما برای افزودن معنی به همه چیز طراحی شده است. این به معنای چیزی نیست. رافالا
من آن را کردم وهمی
خوب شما اکنون با انجمن به روز هستید. تبریک می گویم پس از تشویق تشویق ، کیپ با یک شرکت کننده به نام کنت تماس گرفت. کنت
من فکر کردم که بسیاری از این موارد را به دلیل اینکه آموزش را انجام داده ام ، دارم. من هم فکر کردم که آن را دارم
به این نتیجه رسیدم که معنایی وجود ندارد زیرا من دین را رها کردم. من یک کالیفرنیایی بومی هستم. (خنده)
من به شیوه ای که باید داشته باشم دلبستگی های زیادی داشته ام. کارما من مانند دین من است. من
حتی آن را ندیدم فکر کردم با چیزها واقعاً واضح هستم. من یک تله بزرگ دارم. من یک ناجی دارم
پیچیده در خط کار من بسیاری از افراد با مجتمع های ناجی را دیده ام. این SCHTICK من است روز چهارم: جلسه یک

احتمالاً بسیاری از افراد در اینجا می توانند با آن ارتباط برقرار کنند. من متوجه اشک های زیادی شده ام. من شناسایی شده ام-
با بسیاری از افراد دلسرد و دلسرد می شود. آنچه به خودم می گویم این است که من برای من گریه می کنم. من هستم
خیلی خودی و آنچه من فکر کردم شنیده ام ورنر دیروز می گوید "از آن خارج شوید." و واقعاً
مرا می ترساند کله
این به چه معنی است ، واقعاً شما را ترساند تا از آن خارج شوید؟ کنت
خوب من فقط کارم را از دست دادم. من قصد دارم ازدواج خود را از دست بدهم. فکر می کنم خانه ای را که می رفتم گم کردم
برای خرید کله
یعنی شما قرمز شدی؟ کنت
بله کله
شما شغل خود را از دست نمی دهید. شما کلیدها را از دست می دهید ، درست است؟ کنت (خنده)
