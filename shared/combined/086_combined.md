SPEAKING BEING
to start with the second question. But you can’t get to the possibility until you own what you
already always are. The pathway—concrete, authentic, real—is to embrace what you already
always are.
(pausing)
The problem is that if you move forward from where you are, all you’re doing is changing. The
medium in which you create may be something, but the source of creation is nothing. I had the
privilege of having a relationship with Dick Feynman, the physicist. He took one note the whole
time I knew him: “There are certain things you can only know by creating them.” As a matter
of fact, when he died that note was on his blackboard. That was just my best moment.
(pausing)
When I use the term possibility, I mean stuff in the dimension of “don’t know that you don’t
know.” So that’s what The Forum is about. In the first question, you move backwards. And it
begins with being authentic about your own inauthenticity. To the degree that you’re not able
to be with your own inauthenticity, to that degree you are unable to be. Where’s Jake? I want
to identify the conversation we were having. He’s a fine guy. And yet, I’m saying that there’s
something possible in that area he has a lot of interest that is denied to him because he can’t be
“I don’t do what I said I would do.” I didn’t say that was true about him. That’s not important.
What’s important is that he can’t be there yet. Whatever you’re not able to be with won’t let you
be. So the degree to which you are not able to be with your inauthenticity, to that degree you
are prevented from being. You’re stuck being this, so there’s nothing else you can be. Or you’re
stuck not being that, so there’s nothing else you can be except not that. You’re like a Johnny
one-note “not-that.” Not-that is way more attached than have-to-be-that.
I get this as a dance. I’m uncomfortable. I don’t know where to put my feet. It’s extremely un-
comfortable to be in that “don’t know that you don’t know.”
ERHARD
So “don’t know that you don’t know” is uncomfortable. Ever jumped out of an airplane? It’s
uncomfortable. It’s also a lot of fun.
PARTICIPANT
I’m starting to ask myself, “what is worthwhile?”
ERHARD
That’s a great question: A question to live with. If you live with that question for the rest of your
life, your life will have a quality that it won’t have without it. You ask the question for the light
the question gives.
“
To the degree that you’re not able to be with
your own inauthenticity, to that degree you
are unable to be.
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day One: Session Four

PARTICIPANT
That’s just life.
ERHARD
It’s life in the fast lane. “The more things change the more they remain the same.” That’s true.
And we’ll look at why that’s so.
PARTICIPANT
There’s fun in engaging with this even though I don’t know what I’m doing.
ERHARD
I don’t know what I’m doing. Would you want to dance knowing what you’re doing? But in
our culture, you’re not allowed not to know. It’s shameful not to know. It’s the way we already
always are. There’s an opportunity to develop a certain relationship with not knowing in here
that will give you a more powerful access to what is worth knowing. With me? Thanks.
(pausing)
I’m not going to call on anybody for a while. We’re going to introduce a new what-you-call
subject. We’re going to introduce a new what-I-call distinction. When this is all over, you’ll call
it that too. The distinction is concern. The usual meaning of concern is “worried about.” When I
use the word concern I use it in a broader sense. You and I are constituted by a body of con-
cerns, kind of like what we attend to.
Erhard drew an X on the chalkboard.
ERHARD  (continuing)
X is a symbol that represents one of your concerns. X could be “being related.”
(responding to a participant asking for clarifi cation)
It could be said that human beings are constituted by a body of concerns. The word constitutive
means something more than “is a part of.” It means something like “gives the thing itself.” It’s
like your concerns give you your self.
PARTICIPANT
It gives the essence of my self...
ERHARD
You’ve got to watch because I’m going to say “no” to damn near everything you’re going to say,
and everything you say is good, but it’s not quite it. We’re not going to get this nailed down and
I’ll show you why in just a second. You’re in the right ballpark. You’re fine.
(pausing)
So X represents one of your concerns. Let’s just say this represents the concern for being related.
Everybody’s got this concern. A hermit expresses this concern by saying “I’m not related.”
CONCERN
In introducing the distinction concern, Erhard is articulating
another hint at the realm of Being the Forum is designed to evoke.
As with his earlier conversation about moods, he is relocating the
source of participants’ problems from their own agency to the
contextualizing background.
In Being and Time, Heidegger makes a similar move when
he says that “Being-in-the-world has always dispersed itself or
even split itself up into definite ways of Being-in.” To develop
this point, he provides a list of examples, such as having to do
with something, producing something, attending to something,
undertaking, and considering. “All these ways of Being-in,” he says
“have concern as their kind of Being” (BT 83).
Heidegger also distinguishes a category that he calls deficient
modes of concern, in which “the possibilities of concern are kept
to a ‘bare minimum’” (BT 83). Deficient modes include leaving
undone, neglecting, renouncing, and taking a rest.
In everyday use, the word “concern” can have several
meanings. The most common in our current usage is
apprehension, as in “I am concerned for the success of our
project.” But Heidegger and Erhard have used the term in another
way, as a term for an existential characteristic of human beings, “a
possible way of Being-in-the-world.”
Just as human beings are never not in-the-world, they are
likewise never not concerned, since they are concern essentially.
Consider: you cannot locate yourself outside of your concerns,
since the very attempt to do so is itself a manifestation of concern.
Like lightning, which exists only in flashing, a human being exists
always and only as a body of concerns.
With this distinction, both Heidegger and Erhard are
undermining our everyday understanding of the meanings in
our world. In so doing, they are preparing the way for the final
transformational leap, the evocation of the Nothing. ■

SPEAKING BEING
You’ve got a concern for being related otherwise why would you be concerned about not being
related? Clear?
(pausing)
What is our access to what concerns us? Our access to what concerns us is to get at what con-
cerns us in its aftermath. After the thing happens, in hindsight, we can understand. You can’t
even see it before it happens, can you? The already always access that human beings have to
their concerns, the access you inherited, is something like this...
To the right of the X Erhard listed description, defi nition, and explanation.
ERHARD (continuing)
...All of which, will lead to understanding.
(adding “understanding” to the list)
And out of understanding you derive prescriptions, which gives you guidance for how to deal
with what concerns you: ten steps to... Now, you haven’t articulated all your prescriptions, have
you? Because a lot of your prescriptions are contained in the way you are. They’re set in you.
You want to get this! This is one of those things you have to get. This conversation’s got to be
there for the whole Forum.
(pausing)
So you’ve got, for example, golden rules about relations, such as “keep them happy,” “do some-
thing so they’re attached to you,” et cetera. You and I have got great prescriptions. And what
you can predict out of that is that you and I will get better and better at that. A rat can learn
how to negotiate a maze by finding a piece of cheese, but will choose a new tunnel if the cheese
is moved. The difference between a human being and a rat is as follows: a human being will go
down the tunnel with no cheese forever. You know, you’ve been doing the same shit year after
year after year, hoping for a different outcome. What you care about is being in the right tunnel,
regardless of whether there’s cheese or not. Doing the same thing over and over again expecting
different results. That’s the definition of insanity.
(turning to the chalkboard and indicating the empty space to the left of the X)
Nobody looks over here, before it happens.
(writing the word “source”)
That’s where it’s generated, that’s where it’s created. You want to listen up to this next part. Wake
up! Wake up! When you get to the source of something you are no longer limited by it. That, by
the way, is a part of how this works: by getting to the source of things.
(to Wes and Kipp)
I promise that tomorrow I will give them one answer—the answer to what those guys on moun-
taintops in Tibet are looking for.
(pausing)
We’re going to get at concerns from the source side. You don’t get description, definition,
explanation, and prescription—you just get power. You don’t get a PhD out of here. Plato and
Socrates killed that kind of research anyway. They tried it and found out it didn’t work. You read
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day One: Session Four
75
Lee Iacocca and Al Newheart’s books? They would give everything they’ve got if they could give
what they’ve got to you. Why can’t they?
(pointing to the right of the X on the chalkboard)
Because they write the book in this language, the language of description, definition, and expla-
nation. Because people don’t buy books they can’t understand. That’s why we took your money
before you got in here. When I talk about power I’m talking about something like the freedom
to be, not force, which is the negation of power. I saw a film of a Japanese Judo master, and
never once saw that man stop to think. And I watched the film over and over. The guys he was
fighting stopped to think and got thrown. He was acting out of being something. His opponents,
on the other hand, were acting out of knowing the answers. You see, you can’t throw somebody
unless they’re set some way.
(moving away from the board)
We’re going to talk about another critical thing: the listening that you are. I know you’ve got
questions and comments, and I know some of it didn’t go clunk for you yet. That’s all right.
We’ll get there. I talk in a language designed and crafted to give access to what concerns you at
its source. Now I want to talk about the already always listening that you are. What is the listen-
ing you already always are? For the moment, in this conversation, what you are is a listening.
In the normal course of events, I talk to you like you’re an empty vessel. That isn’t the way it is.
The vessel’s already full, up to the top. It only admits certain things and it expels other things. It
changes certain things. You and I are an already always listening.
(pausing)
When I got this distinction already always listening—not a concept or an idea, but a distinction;
I’m teasing you with that word and you’ll find out about it tomorrow—I began to look at what is
my already always listening. It was very clear to me. The already always listening I was, was “I
know.” I was even a bigger pain in the ass in those days, and a smartass to boot. The only thing I
ever heard was what I already knew. You wake up a certain listening. Your job on this break will
be to discover the listening which you already always are.
(pausing)
Who can see already what your listening is?
PARTICIPANT
The already always listening which I am is that I understand you completely.
ERHARD
Very good.
PARTICIPANT
I’m not good enough.
ERHARD
A lot of us share that one: “The listening I’m going to provide for you is ‘I’m not good enough.’”
Already Always Listening
This is a core distinction of The Forum, a hint that works together
with other distinctions (e.g., mood and concern) to relocate
participants’ understanding of the source of meaning in their
lives. It asks participants to consider that the way they hear (and
see) events and people in their lives is a function of their listening,
rather than being sourced by the people and events themselves.
It would be possible, of course, to engage in a similar
conversation using a more familiar psychological model. Such a
conversation would assert that one’s perceptions are shaped by
one’s attitudes. This way of framing things would be immediately
accessible to anyone whose understanding has been shaped by
th e Cartesian paradigm of an “internal” subject in an objectively
meaningful world.
But locating the source of meaning in one’s listening rather
than in one’s mind situates the process in the world rather than
“in the heads” of participants. This furthers the development of
the Heideggerian model of human being as Being-in-the-world.
Participants in Werner Erhard’s work are frequently coached
to “stay out of your head,” and to “get present.” In Erhard’s
vocabulary, “in your head” is equivalent to “in the past.” This is
where the nature of one’s already always listening is determined:
one makes decisions about people based on past events (“he’s
untrustworthy,” “she’s controlling,” “they never listen to me”), and
these decisions shape the way life occurs in the future.
Erhard has used the analogy of yellow sunglasses, worn for an
extended period of time: eventually, you forget that the sunglasses

SPEAKING BEING
PARTICIPANT
I’m going to figure out what you’re saying wrong.
ERHARD
There’s a lot of crap in school. I don’t want to put the school system down. I have a lot of
respect for teachers. But one of the things you find out in school is that you’re either smart or
dumb. However, there’s no such thing as dumb. I did some work in a school for the disabled.
One student, Jesse, was considered “uneducable.” It was decided, however, that he was educa-
ble enough to be sent to a school to learn to wash cars. On the day I was there, I was told that
Jesse had stuffed a teacher in a trash can. As a consequence, he got sent back to the home for
disabled students, where he could sit around, be friendly, and play. Stupid is a way to survive in
school. Stupid is an act, a racket.
PARTICIPANT
The already always listening that I am is “I don’t want to and you can’t make me.”
ERHARD
You want to get this. A lot of people listen through “life is hard.” A lot of people listen through
“life is a burden.” My dentist told me about his experience as a Boy Scout. No matter what the
scoutmaster had suggested—hiking, swimming, going home—the Scouts always had the same
response: “OH NOOOOOO!” You are this listening. That’s the clearing you are in which life
happens.
PARTICIPANT
Mine is “How can I use this?” “How can I get better?”
ERHARD
Almost everybody’s like that: “How can I use this?” Almost all the power in the world can’t be
used. People don’t use power. Power uses people.
PARTICIPANT
“What are you going to tell me new that I don’t already know?”
ERHARD
Great.
PARTICIPANT
My already always listening is “How can I help you? Do you like me now?”
ERHARD
Beautiful.
are the cause of the world’s yellowness. Like the sunglasses, one’s
way of listening remains invisible because it is always and already
determining one’s point of view, making the way a situation
appears become the way things are. The aim of this inquiry is
for participants to notice these already always ways of listening
in as much specificity as possible. The Forum proposes that the
fundamental elements of human listening are widely shared, even
across cultures; Erhard asserts that there is a “culture of human
being” that transcends national boundaries. All human beings,
for example, listen for positive assessments of themselves, and
for evidence that they are right in their beliefs about the world.
But individuals develop specific variations, and in this part of The
Forum dialogue participants are encouraged to discover their own.
In this way, the dialogue continues to turn participants toward
themselves in an intensely reflexive process. ■
Forum Day One: Session Four

PARTICIPANT
My already always listening is “I’m very clever and I’ll prove it to you.”
ERHARD
See, there are times when “I’m very clever and I’ll prove it to you” is a very workable listening.
But if you’re already always “I’m very clever and I’ll prove it to you,” there are a lot of occasions
that doesn’t match.
PARTICIPANT
I have several of these. My listening is that “I’m not good enough.”
ERHARD
“I’m not good enough” almost always has got another listening, which is “I’m better than you
are.” “I’m not good enough but I’m better than you are.” You want to listen up. These guys are
being authentic about their own inauthenticity. These are not nice people. They are cold, calcu-
lating, conniving people. They are out to get you to like them. And it’s not them. They didn’t in-
vent that. And if this is the opening that I’m providing for the world to occur in, it’s not surpris-
ing how the world shows up. We have done some work facilitating meetings between American
and Soviet representatives. We discovered that the already always listening of the Americans is
“You can’t be trusted for your word; now let’s talk.” This made the results predictable.
PARTICIPANT
My always already listening is “I’m too smart and too quick, and I better not let anyone know
that.”
ERHARD
It’s the “already always way of listening.” I keep losing why the order is important, but there’s
some significance to the order. What is the already always listening that gives you being the way
you are? Believe it or not, the way you are is given to you by your listening.
PARTICIPANT
“You’re boring.”
ERHARD
We’re going to take a break. I want you to consider that the way you are is given to you by your
listening. I’m inviting you to get down to the already always listening, you know, as deep as you
can, however deep that happens to be. Clear?
The Forum adjourned for the final break of the day at 10 pm.

برای شروع با سوال دوم. اما تا زمانی که صاحب آنچه هستید ، نمی توانید به این امکان برسید
در حال حاضر همیشه مسیر - هماهنگ ، معتبر ، واقعی - این است که آنچه را که قبلاً در آغوش می گیرید
همیشه هستند (مکث)
مشکل این است که اگر از جایی که هستید به جلو بروید ، تمام کاری که انجام می دهید تغییر می کند. در
متوسطی که در آن ایجاد می کنید ممکن است چیزی باشد ، اما منبع خلقت چیزی نیست. من داشتم
امتیاز داشتن رابطه با دیک فینمن ، فیزیکدان. او یک یادداشت را در کل گرفت
زمانی که من او را می شناختم: "موارد خاصی وجود دارد که فقط با ایجاد آنها می توانید بدانید." به عنوان یک موضوع
در حقیقت ، هنگامی که او درگذشت ، این یادداشت روی تخته سیاه او بود. این فقط بهترین لحظه من بود. (مکث)
وقتی از اصطلاح امکان استفاده می کنم ، منظور من چیزهایی در بعد "نمی دانید که شما نمی دانید
بدانید. " این همان چیزی است که انجمن در مورد آن است.
با اصالت بودن در مورد عدم اطمینان خود شروع می شود. به حدی که قادر نیستید
برای اینکه با عدم اطمینان خود باشید ، تا آن میزان قادر به این باشید. جیک کجاست؟ من می خواهم
برای شناسایی مکالمه ای که داشتیم. او یک پسر خوب است و با این حال ، من می گویم که وجود دارد
چیزی که در آن منطقه ممکن است علاقه زیادی داشته باشد که به او انکار می شود زیرا او نمی تواند باشد
"من کاری را که گفتم انجام نمی دهم." من نگفتم که در مورد او صادق بود. این مهم نیست نکته مهم این است که او هنوز نمی تواند در آنجا باشد. هرچه نتوانید با آن باشید به شما اجازه نمی دهد
باشد بنابراین درجه ای که شما قادر نیستید با عدم اطمینان خود باشید ، تا آن درجه
از وجود جلوگیری می شود. شما این را گیر کرده اید ، بنابراین هیچ چیز دیگری نیست که می توانید باشید. یا شما هستید
این که اینطور نیست ، بنابراین هیچ چیز دیگری نیست که شما می توانید جز این نیست. شما مانند جانی هستید
یک نت "نه آن". نه این به روشی که بیشتر از آن وصل شده است. من این را به عنوان رقص می گیرم. من ناراحت کننده هستم من نمی دانم پاهایم را کجا بگذارم. این بسیار غیر
راحت بودن در آن "نمی دانم که نمی دانید."
درز
بنابراین "نمی دانید که شما نمی دانید" ناراحت کننده است. تا به حال از هواپیما پریده اید؟ این است
ناراحت کننده همچنین بسیار سرگرم کننده است شرکت کننده
من شروع به سؤال از خودم می کنم ، "چه ارزشمندی است؟"
درز
این یک سوال عالی است: سوالی که باید با آن زندگی کرد. اگر برای بقیه خود با این سوال زندگی می کنید
زندگی ، زندگی شما کیفیتی خواهد داشت که بدون آن نخواهد بود. شما سوال را برای نور می پرسید
سوال می دهد. "
به حدی که نتوانید با آن باشید
عدم اعتماد به نفس خود ، به آن درجه شما
قادر به بودن نیست erhard (ادامه)

شرکت کننده
این فقط زندگی است درز
این زندگی در خط سریع است. "هرچه چیزها بیشتر تغییر کنند بیشتر یکسان باقی می مانند." این درست است و ما خواهیم دید که چرا چنین است شرکت کننده
درگیری با این موضوع سرگرم کننده است حتی اگر نمی دانم چه کاری انجام می دهم. درز
من نمی دانم چه کاری انجام می دهم. آیا می خواهید رقصید که می دانید چه کاری انجام می دهید؟ اما در
فرهنگ ما ، شما مجاز نیستید که بدانید. شرم آور است که نمی دانید. این راهی است که ما در حال حاضر
همیشه هستند فرصتی برای ایجاد یک رابطه خاص با عدم دانستن در اینجا وجود دارد
این به شما دسترسی قدرتمندتری به آنچه ارزش دانستن آن را می دهد ، می دهد. با من؟ ممنون (مکث)
من نمی خواهم مدتی با کسی تماس بگیرم. ما قصد داریم یک مورد جدید را معرفی کنیم
موضوع ما می خواهیم یک تمایز جدید را که-تماس می گیریم معرفی کنیم. وقتی این کار تمام شد ، تماس خواهید گرفت
این هم تمایز نگران کننده است. معنای معمول نگرانی "نگران" است. وقتی من
از کلمه نگرانی که من از آن به معنای وسیع تری استفاده می کنم استفاده کنید. من و شما توسط یک بدن از
cerns ، نوع مانند آنچه در آن شرکت می کنیم. Erhard یک X را روی تخته گچ کشید. erhard (ادامه)
X نمادی است که یکی از نگرانی های شما را نشان می دهد. X می تواند "مرتبط بودن" باشد.
(پاسخ به یک شرکت کننده که درخواست شفافیت می کند)
می توان گفت که انسان توسط بدنه نگرانی ها تشکیل می شود. کلمه سازنده
به معنای چیزی بیشتر از "بخشی از" است. این بدان معنی است که چیزی مانند "خود چیز را می دهد". این است
مانند نگرانی های شما به شما خود را می دهد. شرکت کننده
این جوهر من را می بخشد ... erhard
شما باید تماشا کنید زیرا من می خواهم بگویم "نه" برای لعنت به هر آنچه می خواهید بگویید ،
و هر آنچه شما می گویید خوب است ، اما کاملاً نیست. ما نمی خواهیم این میخ را پایین بیاوریم و
من به شما نشان خواهم داد که چرا فقط در یک ثانیه. شما در یک بالگرد راست هستید. شما خوب هستید (مکث)
بنابراین X یکی از نگرانی های شما را نشان می دهد. بیایید فقط بگوییم که این نشان دهنده نگرانی برای ارتباط است. همه این نگرانی را دارند. یک هرمیت با گفتن "من مرتبط نیستم" این نگرانی را ابراز می کند.
نگرانی
در معرفی نگرانی تمایز ، Erhard بیان کننده است
نکته دیگری که در مورد قلمرو حضور در انجمن وجود دارد ، به گونه ای طراحی شده است. او مانند گفتگوی قبلی خود در مورد خلق و خوی ، او در حال جابجایی است
منبع مشکلات شرکت کنندگان از آژانس خود به
پیشینه زمینه سازی در زمان و زمان ، هایدگر هنگامی که حرکت مشابهی انجام می دهد
او می گوید: "بودن در جهان همیشه خود را پراکنده کرده است یا
حتی خود را به روشهای مشخصی برای حضور در هم تقسیم می کند. " توسعه
این نکته ، او لیستی از نمونه ها را ارائه می دهد ، مانند انجام این کار
با چیزی ، تولید چیزی ، حضور در چیزی ،
تعهد و در نظر گرفتن او می گوید: "همه این روشهای موجود بودن"
"نگرانی به عنوان نوع وجود آنها" (BT 83). هایدگر همچنین مقوله ای را که او را کمبود می نامد متمایز می کند
شیوه های نگرانی ، که در آن "امکانات نگرانی حفظ می شود
به "حداقل لخت" (BT 83). حالت های کمبود شامل ترک
خنثی کردن ، غفلت ، انصراف و استراحت. در استفاده روزمره ، کلمه "نگرانی" می تواند چندین مورد داشته باشد
معانی شایع ترین در استفاده فعلی ما این است
دلهره ، همانطور که در "من نگران موفقیت ما هستم
پروژه. " اما هایدگر و ارهارد از این اصطلاح در دیگری استفاده کرده اند
راه ، به عنوان اصطلاحی برای یک ویژگی وجودی انسانها ، "الف
روش احتمالی بودن در جهان. "
درست همانطور که انسان هرگز در جهان نیست ، آنها هستند
به همین ترتیب هرگز نگران نیست ، زیرا آنها اساساً نگران هستند. در نظر بگیرید: شما نمی توانید خود را خارج از نگرانی های خود پیدا کنید ،
از آنجا که تلاش برای انجام این کار ، خود تجلی نگرانی است. مانند رعد و برق ، که فقط در چشمک زدن وجود دارد ، یک انسان وجود دارد
همیشه و فقط به عنوان یک بدن نگرانی. با این تمایز ، هم هایدگر و هم ارهارد هستند
تضعیف درک روزمره ما از معانی در
دنیای ما با این کار ، آنها راه را برای فینال آماده می کنند
جهش تحول گرا ، برانگیختن هیچ چیز. ■

شما نگران این هستید که در غیر این صورت نگران نباشید
مرتبط؟ پاک کردن؟ (مکث)
دسترسی ما به آنچه ما را نگران می کند چیست؟ دسترسی ما به آنچه ما را نگران می کند این است که به چه مواردی بپردازیم
پس از آن ما را سرنگ می کند. بعد از اینکه اتفاق می افتد ، در ضمن ، می توانیم درک کنیم. شما نمی توانید
حتی قبل از این که اتفاق بیفتد ، می توانید؟ همیشه دسترسی به انسانها
نگرانی های آنها ، دسترسی شما به ارث برد ، چیزی شبیه به این است ... در سمت راست توضیحات ، تعریف و توضیحات ذکر شده ذکر شده است. erhard (ادامه)
... همه اینها منجر به درک خواهد شد. (افزودن "درک" به لیست)
و از درک شما نسخه هایی را به دست می آورید ، که به شما راهنمایی می کند که چگونه معامله کنید
با آنچه شما را نگران می کند: ده قدم به ... اکنون ، شما تمام نسخه های خود را بیان نکرده اید ،
شما؟ از آنجا که بسیاری از نسخه های شما در روشی که هستید موجود است. آنها در شما قرار دارند. شما می خواهید این را بدست آورید! این یکی از مواردی است که شما باید بدست آورید. این مکالمه باید باشد
برای کل انجمن وجود دارد. (مکث)
بنابراین ، به عنوان مثال ، در مورد روابط ، مانند "آنها را خوشحال نگه دارید" ، "برخی؟
چیز بنابراین آنها به شما وصل شده اند. "
شما می توانید از این مسئله پیش بینی کنید که شما و من در این کار بهتر و بهتر خواهیم شد. یک موش می تواند یاد بگیرد
نحوه مذاکره در مورد پیچ ​​و خم با پیدا کردن یک تکه پنیر ، اما اگر پنیر یک تونل جدید را انتخاب کنید
منتقل شده است تفاوت بین یک انسان و یک موش به شرح زیر است: یک انسان می رود
پایین تونل بدون پنیر برای همیشه. می دانید ، سال بعد همان گهواره را انجام داده اید
سال به سال ، به امید نتیجه متفاوت. آنچه شما به آن اهمیت می دهید بودن در تونل مناسب است ،
صرف نظر از اینکه پنیر وجود دارد یا نه. بارها و بارها همین کار را انجام می دهیم
نتایج متفاوت این تعریف جنون است. (چرخاندن به تخته گچ و نشان دادن فضای خالی در سمت چپ x)
قبل از این که هیچ کس به اینجا نگاه نمی کند. (نوشتن کلمه "منبع")

Taintops در تبت به دنبال آن هستند. (مکث)
ما می خواهیم از طرف منبع نگران شویم. شما توضیحات ، تعریف ،
توضیح ، و نسخه - شما فقط قدرت می گیرید. شما دکترا را از اینجا دریافت نمی کنید. افلاطون و

کتاب های لی Iacocca و Al Newheart؟ آنها اگر می توانستند به هر آنچه می دهند می دادند
آنچه آنها به شما داده اند. چرا آنها نمی توانند؟ (اشاره به سمت راست X در تخته گچ)
زیرا آنها کتاب را به این زبان می نویسند ، زبان توضیحات ، تعریف و توضیح-
ملت. از آنجا که مردم کتابی نمی خرند که نمی توانند درک کنند. به همین دلیل ما پول شما را گرفتیم
قبل از ورود به اینجا وقتی در مورد قدرت صحبت می کنم ، در مورد چیزی مثل آزادی صحبت می کنم
برای بودن ، نه نیرو ، که نفی قدرت است. من فیلمی از یک استاد جودو ژاپنی دیدم ، و
هرگز یک بار ندیدم که آن مرد متوقف شود. و من فیلم را بارها و بارها تماشا کردم. بچه هایی که او بود
جنگ متوقف شد و فکر کرد. او از چیزی بودن عمل می کرد. مخالفانش ،
از طرف دیگر ، از دانستن پاسخ ها عمل می کردند. می بینید ، نمی توانید کسی را پرتاب کنید
مگر اینکه به نوعی تنظیم شوند. (دور شدن از هیئت مدیره)
ما می خواهیم در مورد چیز مهم دیگری صحبت کنیم: گوش دادن به شما. من می دانم که شما دارید
سوالات و نظرات ، و من می دانم که برخی از آن هنوز برای شما ناخوشایند نیست. این درست است ما به آنجا خواهیم رسید. من به زبانی که طراحی و ساخته شده است برای دسترسی به آنچه شما را نگران می کند صحبت می کنم
منبع آن اکنون می خواهم در مورد همیشه گوش دادن به شما صحبت کنم. گوش دادن چیست-
شما همیشه همیشه هستید؟ برای لحظه ای ، در این گفتگو ، آنچه شما هستید گوش دادن است. در دوره عادی وقایع ، من با شما صحبت می کنم مثل اینکه شما یک کشتی خالی هستید. این راهی نیست که هست. کشتی در حال حاضر پر است ، تا بالا. این فقط موارد خاصی را می پذیرد و چیزهای دیگری را نیز بیرون می کشد. من
برخی موارد را تغییر می دهد. من و شما همیشه در حال گوش دادن هستیم. (مکث)
وقتی این تمایز را قبلاً همیشه گوش کردم - نه یک مفهوم یا یک ایده ، بلکه یک تمایز است.
من شما را با آن کلمه اذیت می کنم و فردا در مورد آن خواهید فهمید - من شروع کردم به بررسی اینکه چیست
من همیشه گوش می دهم برای من خیلی واضح بود. قبلاً همیشه گوش می کردم ، "من
بدانید. " من در آن روزها حتی یک درد بزرگ در الاغ بودم و تنها چیزی برای بوت شدن.
تا به حال شنیده ام همان چیزی بود که من قبلاً می دانستم. شما یک گوش دادن خاص را از خواب بیدار می کنید. کار شما در این استراحت خواهد بود
برای کشف گوش دادن به همیشه باشید. (مکث)
چه کسی می تواند ببیند گوش دادن شما چیست؟ شرکت کننده
قبلاً همیشه گوش می کنم که من شما را کاملاً درک می کنم. درز
خیلی خوب شرکت کننده
من به اندازه کافی خوب نیستم درز
بسیاری از ما این یکی را به اشتراک می گذاریم: "گوش دادن من برای شما ارائه می دهم" من به اندازه کافی خوب نیستم. "
در حال حاضر همیشه گوش دادن
این یک تمایز اصلی انجمن است ، اشاره ای که با هم کار می کند
با سایر تمایزات (به عنوان مثال ، خلق و خو و نگرانی) برای جابجایی
درک شرکت کنندگان از منبع معنی در آنها
زندگی می کند. از شرکت کنندگان می خواهد که نحوه شنیدن آنها را در نظر بگیرند (و
ببینید) رویدادها و افراد در زندگی آنها تابعی از گوش دادن آنهاست ،
به جای اینکه توسط مردم و خود وقایع تهیه شوند. البته این امکان وجود دارد که در موارد مشابه شرکت کنیم
مکالمه با استفاده از یک مدل روانشناختی آشناتر. چنین
مکالمه ادعا می کند که برداشت های شخص توسط
نگرش شخص این روش فریم کردن چیزها بلافاصله خواهد بود
در دسترس برای هر کسی که درک آن شکل گرفته است
الگوی دکارتی یک موضوع "داخلی" در یک عینی
دنیای معنی دار اما یافتن منبع معنی در گوش دادن شخص
از آنچه در ذهن شخص این روند را در جهان قرار می دهد و نه
"در سر" شرکت کنندگان. این باعث پیشرفت می شود
الگوی هایدگریایی انسان به عنوان موجود در جهان است. شرکت کنندگان در کارهای ورنر ارهارد اغلب مربی می شوند
برای "دور ماندن از سر خود" و "حضور". در Erhard's
واژگان ، "در ذهن شما" معادل "در گذشته" است. این است
جایی که ماهیت همیشه گوش دادن شخص در حال حاضر مشخص شده است:
یکی در مورد افراد بر اساس وقایع گذشته تصمیم می گیرد ("او است
غیرقابل اعتماد ، "" او کنترل می کند "،" آنها هرگز به من گوش نمی دهند ") ، و
این تصمیمات شیوه زندگی در آینده را شکل می دهد. Erhard از قیاس عینک آفتابی زرد استفاده کرده است ، که برای
مدت زمان طولانی: در نهایت ، فراموش می کنید که عینک آفتابی

من می خواهم بفهمم چه اشتباهی می گویید. درز
در مدرسه تله زیادی وجود دارد. من نمی خواهم سیستم مدرسه را پایین بیاورم. من چیزهای زیادی دارم
احترام به معلمان. اما یکی از مواردی که در مدرسه می دانید این است که شما باهوش هستید یا
لال با این حال ، هیچ چیز مانند گنگ وجود ندارد. من در یک مدرسه برای معلولین کار کردم. یکی از دانشجویان ، جسی ، "غیرقابل تحصیل" تلقی می شد. با این حال تصمیم گرفته شد که او تحصیلات داشته باشد-
به اندازه کافی خفه می شود که برای یادگیری ماشین های شستشو به مدرسه فرستاده شود. در روزی که من آنجا بودم ، به من گفته شد
جسی معلم را در سطل زباله پر کرده بود. در نتیجه ، او به خانه فرستاده شد
دانش آموزان معلول ، جایی که او می توانست در اطرافش بنشیند ، دوستانه باشد و بازی کند. احمق راهی برای زنده ماندن است
مدرسه احمقانه یک عمل است ، یک راکت. شرکت کننده
قبلاً همیشه گوش می دهم که من هستم "من نمی خواهم و شما نمی توانید من را بسازید."

شما می خواهید این را بدست آورید. بسیاری از مردم از طریق "زندگی سخت است" گوش می دهند. بسیاری از مردم گوش می دهند
"زندگی یک بار است." دندانپزشک من در مورد تجربه خود به عنوان یک پسر پیشاهنگ به من گفت. مهم نیست که چه
Scoutmaster پیشنهاد کرده بود - هویت ، شنا ، رفتن به خانه - پیشاهنگان همیشه همین کار را داشتند
پاسخ: "اوه نوووو!" شما این گوش دادن هستید. این پاکسازی شماست که در آن زندگی هستید

تقریباً همه اینگونه هستند: "چگونه می توانم از این استفاده کنم؟" تقریباً تمام قدرت در جهان نمی تواند باشد

زیبا علت زردی جهان است. مانند عینک آفتابی ، شخص
روش گوش دادن نامرئی است زیرا همیشه و در حال حاضر است
تعیین دیدگاه شخص ، ایجاد وضعیت به یک وضعیت
به نظر می رسد به روشی تبدیل می شود. هدف این تحقیق این است
برای اینکه شرکت کنندگان متوجه این موارد همیشه روشهای گوش دادن شوند
در حد ممکن ویژگی. این انجمن پیشنهاد می کند که
عناصر اساسی گوش دادن به انسان به طور گسترده ای مشترک هستند.
در سراسر فرهنگ ؛ ارهارد ادعا می کند که "فرهنگ انسان وجود دارد
بودن "که از مرزهای ملی فراتر می رود. همه انسانها ،
به عنوان مثال ، به ارزیابی های مثبت خود گوش دهید ، و
برای شواهدی مبنی بر اینکه آنها در اعتقادات خود در مورد جهان درست هستند. اما افراد تغییرات خاصی را ایجاد می کنند ، و در این بخش از
شرکت کنندگان در گفتگوی انجمن تشویق می شوند که خودشان را کشف کنند. به این ترتیب ، گفتگو همچنان شرکت کنندگان را به سمت خود سوق می دهد
خود در یک فرآیند شدید بازتابنده. ■

همیشه گوش دادن من این است: "من بسیار باهوش هستم و آن را به شما ثابت می کنم."
درز
ببینید ، مواقعی وجود دارد که "من بسیار باهوش هستم و آن را به شما ثابت می کنم" گوش دادن بسیار کارآمد است. اما اگر شما همیشه "من بسیار باهوش هستم و آن را به شما ثابت می کنم" ، موارد زیادی وجود دارد
این مطابقت ندارد شرکت کننده
من چندین مورد از اینها را دارم. گوش دادن من این است که "من به اندازه کافی خوب نیستم."
درز
"من به اندازه کافی خوب نیستم" تقریباً همیشه گوش دادن دیگری دارم ، که "من از شما بهتر هستم
هستند. " "من به اندازه کافی خوب نیستم اما از شما بهتر هستم." شما می خواهید گوش دهید
معتبر بودن در مورد عدم اطمینان خودشان. اینها افراد خوبی نیستند. آنها سرد هستند ، محاسبه
وام ، افراد وابسته. آنها بیرون هستند تا شما را دوست داشته باشند. و آنها نیستند آنها این کار را نکردند
تخلیه کنید که و اگر این افتتاحیه ای است که من برای جهان در آن ایجاد می کنم ، جای تعجب ندارد
چگونه جهان ظاهر می شود. ما برخی از کارها را انجام داده ایم که جلسات بین آمریکایی ها را تسهیل می کند
و نمایندگان اتحاد جماهیر شوروی. ما فهمیدیم که همیشه گوش دادن به آمریکایی ها است
"به شما نمی توان به حرف خود اعتماد کرد ؛ اکنون اجازه دهید صحبت کنیم." این باعث شده نتایج قابل پیش بینی باشند. شرکت کننده

این "همیشه روش گوش دادن" است. من مدام از دست می دهم که چرا سفارش مهم است ، اما وجود دارد
برخی از اهمیت برای سفارش. چه چیزی که همیشه گوش می دهد که به شما راه می دهد
شما هستید؟ باور کنید یا نه ، روشی که شما با گوش دادن به شما داده می شود. شرکت کننده
"شما خسته کننده هستید."
درز
ما می خواهیم استراحت کنیم. من می خواهم شما در نظر بگیرید که روشی که به شما داده می شود توسط شما
گوش دادن من از شما دعوت می کنم تا به همان اندازه که در حال گوش دادن به همیشه گوش می دهید ، به همان اندازه عمیق باشید
می تواند ، هرچند عمیق که اتفاق می افتد. پاک کردن؟ این انجمن برای تعطیلات نهایی روز ساعت 10 شب به تعویق افتاد.
