Forum Day Three: Session Four
287
(applause)
At this point Jane raised her hand. When she stood, her appearance was strikingly diff erent, and the
participants applauded.
ERHARD (to Jane)
Do you know what they’re clapping about?
JANE
No.
(laughter)
ERHARD
People don’t clap for ugly worthless people, do they?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
So you know what they’re clapping about?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
They’re clapping in part due to your attractiveness, which comes from your being a big,
generous person.
JANE
Hmm hhmmm.
(laughter)
ERHARD
You got that didn’t you? You’ve been big and generous in our conversations, haven’t you?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Good. Nothing to be embarrassed about there. Nothing to be caught in. They’re also clapping for
another kind of generosity and that’s the generosity that they think they see and that I think I see in
your beginning to get off  it. Like getting off  your act about being worthless. All those other things.

SPEAKING BEING
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
You think you’re getting off  that? Being ugly and worthless?
JANE
In some ways, but it’ll probably still be with me.
ERHARD
You’re saying that you’re getting off  it but that in some ways it’ll probably still be with you?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Couple things. First off , there’s the diff erence between apes and you and me: you and me
have “probablys.” The ape doesn’t have any probablys, because the ape doesn’t have—listen
up here—don’t get sucked in by her attractiveness...
(laughter)
The ape doesn’t have any “probablys” because the ape doesn’t have any language. Only you
and I have probablys. And we invent those probablys with our mouths. We don’t know that. We
think we’re inventing probablys by extrapolating the past into the future. You understand the
word “extrapolate”?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
Extending the past into the future? You know you take a line that goes like this...
(drawing a line in the air)
And then it goes like that. You’re extending the line from the past into the future.
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
So, you and I think that we say probably based on this mental operation called extending the
past into the future. And that’s why you said “probably” to me, is it not?
