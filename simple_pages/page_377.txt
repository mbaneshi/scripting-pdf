Forum Day Four: Session One

SALLY
I got what you were saying up until you were talking about talking.
ERHARD
Good and bad is talking. When you talk about good and bad you’re talking about talking.
SALLY
Okay, I got it.
ERHARD
Did you sort it out?
SALLY
Yeah, there’s just one more thing I want to ask.
ERHARD
Sure.
SALLY
So this morning, we got into a fi ght, my whole family...
ERHARD
Right. Families do that, don’t they?
SALLY
Yeah, all the time.
ERHARD
No: They do it when they do it and they don’t do it when they don’t do it.
SALLY
Right.
ERHARD
“All the time” is a story.
SALLY
Right. So we got in a fi ght this morning, and so I said “It doesn’t mean anything, so leave me 
the fuck alone.”
ERHARD
Right. How many people have done that already: “It doesn’t mean anything, therefore...” 
the transformation of human being arise in that very surrender of 
human control to the unpredictable play of Being, the surrender 
to the mutuality of the event of appropriation? The following 
passage, in which Heidegger is thinking through a Parmenidean
fragment, suggests the essential and continual uncertainty
constitutive of the three-fold path he posits, “that of Being, that 
of not-Being, and that of seeming”:
Superior knowing [. . .] is granted only to one
r
who has experienced the sweeping storm on
the way of Being, to whom the terror of the
second way to the abyss of Nothing has not 
remained foreign, and who has still taken
over the third way, the way of seeming, as a
constant and urgent need. To this knowing
belongs what the Greeks in their great age
called tolma: to dare everything with Being, 
not-Being, and seeming all at once—that is, 
to raise Dasein above itself into the de-cision 
about Being, not-Being, and seeming.
