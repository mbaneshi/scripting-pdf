Forum Day Four: Session Two
403
WES
Recognition that that is part of the deal.
DONALD
Right and that’s part of the deal of being human, not part of my deal, not part of Ron’s deal. The
gorilla doesn’t have the problem “weight.” The gorilla is just the gorilla. Because we’re human
and we show up in this culture of human, and we’ve got languaging then we’ve got a weight
problem.
WES
No, we’ve got problems that shouldn’t be problems.
DONALD
We’ve got problems that shouldn’t be problems. Yeah. To me, when you put up there that in
life there are problems, that seemed very fl ippant. Like “Huh, in life there are problems.” Like
there’s no weight to them, there’s no...
WES
No, you should have the problems that you have. Sorry. The problems that you have are appro-
priate. And they are part of your being alive.
DONALD
Not just my being alive.
WES
Right, being alive. So there’s an appropriateness to problems. There’s not a “shouldn’t be” to
problems. It’s part of living.
DONALD
Oh, in life there are problems.
WES
Exactly. Yeah. So you have started to shift your relationship to problems.
DONALD
So it’s not a problem that I have a problem. It’s in life that I have a problem.
WES
Yeah. It’s not a problem that you have a problem.
DONALD
Right. Like everybody else doesn’t.

SPEAKING BEING
WES
Like the people over there who’ve really got it made have less problems than you do.
DONALD
But... they do.
(laughter)r
WES
No, they don’t. I promise you they don’t. They have more problems than you.
DONALD
So it’s something like the relationship with the problems?
WES
Yeah. They are able to relate to problems as part of the game.
DONALD
Instead of that it shouldn’t be.
WES
Exactly.
DONALD
Oh, I got it. Earlier someone said that problems are a declaration. You said no. But they are a
declaration...
WES
We’re a little ahead of ourselves. “In life there are problems” is ultimately a declaration. And
“In life, problems shouldn’t be” is ultimately a declaration.
DONALD
We just don’t know that.
WES
Right.
DONALD
So, would the declaration that problems show up in be a complaint declaration?
WES
Yeah.
