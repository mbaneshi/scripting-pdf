Forum Day Three: Session Three 253
BEVERLY
I’m at one point today and I’ll be at another point tomorrow.
ERHARD
And another point the day after that. And after that you’ll be in another point. On and on until 
there are no more points and they’ll throw dirt in your face.
BEVERLY
I want to make it easier for me to get to points faster.
ERHARD
No. You won’t get there any faster.
BEVERLY
Then where am I going?
ERHARD
Nowhere. There’s nowhere to go. You already got there.
(loudly)
There’s no place to go! You already got there! You don’t like it now that you’re there? That is 
too fucking bad.
BEVERLY
I think there’s another way of looking at it.
(laughter)
ERHARD
Beverly, there are always other ways of looking at it and all of them are unenlightened.
BEVERLY
Why did I pay $625? 
ERHARD 
You paid $625 to be that life is empty and meaningless, and that it’s meaningless that life is 
empty and meaningless. You paid $625 to fi nd out that life isn’t going to be diff erent. Like it’s 
always been: it is like it is. You don’t live life like it is what it is. You live life like “it’s going to 
be diff erent.” And that makes you an asshole. It’s not a bad thing to be, just a thing to be, like 
a fart. All the stuff  we did... everything we’ve done up to now was to get to the point where we 
could have this discussion. I told you up front that we were going to keep moving back until we 
got to zero. Empty and meaningless is as zero as you can get.
