SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Whatever that’s about will come up before we’re through. You know you’ve got to be a big per-
son to have the kind of conversation we just had?
Erhard had been very gentle during this entire interaction, standing very close to Jane. Kipp then
proceeded to do the seminar program enrollment.
ERHARD (to the group)
For the dinner break there are two assignments. Observe and inquire into the real nature of 
your relating to other people. What’s really going on with you when you’re relating to other
people? As you’re being with people, what’s really going on with you? And two, after dinner, I
invite you to have a conversation about the seminar program.
The Forum adjourned for a dinner break.
