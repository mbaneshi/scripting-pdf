Forum Day Four: Session Three 495
MIKE
No I don’t.
ERHARD
You’ve got to say slow or fast. Don’t you. 
MIKE
Right.
ERHARD
How fast does the baseball travel when the pitcher pitches?
MIKE
Maybe sixty miles an hour?
ERHARD
Is that fast?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
Not for guys with high batting averages: That looks like a home run. A ball traveling that fast: 
That’s a ball with home run written on it. That’s like me picking up this ball off  the fl oor for 
them. It occurs as a home-run pitch if it’s traveling fast enough. And for me, I don’t even see it. 
Right?
MIKE
Right.
ERHARD
Same ball traveling at the same speed according to the radar gun, occurs one way for one person 
and a diff erent way for a diff erent person.
MIKE
So state what you said about occurring? You mentioned something else...
ERHARD
I said that your actions are a correlate of the occurring. Your actions dance with the way the 
world occurs for you, not the way the world is. And not because of something inside you, 
Mike. You don’t have properties inside you. You don’t have skill or intelligence or stupidity 
or clumsiness inside of you. All you’ve got is your actions correlated with the world as an 
occurring.
