SPEAKING BEING
to start with the second question. But you can’t get to the possibility until you own what you
already always are. The pathway—concrete, authentic, real—is to embrace what you already
always are.
(pausing)
The problem is that if you move forward from where you are, all you’re doing is changing. The
medium in which you create may be something, but the source of creation is nothing. I had the
privilege of having a relationship with Dick Feynman, the physicist. He took one note the whole
time I knew him: “There are certain things you can only know by creating them.” As a matter
of fact, when he died that note was on his blackboard. That was just my best moment.
(pausing)
When I use the term possibility, I mean stuff in the dimension of “don’t know that you don’t
know.” So that’s what The Forum is about. In the first question, you move backwards. And it
begins with being authentic about your own inauthenticity. To the degree that you’re not able
to be with your own inauthenticity, to that degree you are unable to be. Where’s Jake? I want
to identify the conversation we were having. He’s a fine guy. And yet, I’m saying that there’s
something possible in that area he has a lot of interest that is denied to him because he can’t be
“I don’t do what I said I would do.” I didn’t say that was true about him. That’s not important.
What’s important is that he can’t be there yet. Whatever you’re not able to be with won’t let you
be. So the degree to which you are not able to be with your inauthenticity, to that degree you
are prevented from being. You’re stuck being this, so there’s nothing else you can be. Or you’re
stuck not being that, so there’s nothing else you can be except not that. You’re like a Johnny
one-note “not-that.” Not-that is way more attached than have-to-be-that.
I get this as a dance. I’m uncomfortable. I don’t know where to put my feet. It’s extremely un-
comfortable to be in that “don’t know that you don’t know.”
ERHARD
So “don’t know that you don’t know” is uncomfortable. Ever jumped out of an airplane? It’s
uncomfortable. It’s also a lot of fun.
PARTICIPANT
I’m starting to ask myself, “what is worthwhile?”
ERHARD
That’s a great question: A question to live with. If you live with that question for the rest of your
life, your life will have a quality that it won’t have without it. You ask the question for the light
the question gives.
“
To the degree that you’re not able to be with
your own inauthenticity, to that degree you
are unable to be.

PARTICIPANT
That’s just life.
ERHARD
It’s life in the fast lane. “The more things change the more they remain the same.” That’s true.
And we’ll look at why that’s so.
PARTICIPANT
There’s fun in engaging with this even though I don’t know what I’m doing.
ERHARD
I don’t know what I’m doing. Would you want to dance knowing what you’re doing? But in
our culture, you’re not allowed not to know. It’s shameful not to know. It’s the way we already
always are. There’s an opportunity to develop a certain relationship with not knowing in here
that will give you a more powerful access to what is worth knowing. With me? Thanks.
(pausing)
I’m not going to call on anybody for a while. We’re going to introduce a new what-you-call
subject. We’re going to introduce a new what-I-call distinction. When this is all over, you’ll call
it that too. The distinction is concern. The usual meaning of concern is “worried about.” When I
use the word concern I use it in a broader sense. You and I are constituted by a body of con-
cerns, kind of like what we attend to.
Erhard drew an X on the chalkboard.
ERHARD  (continuing)
X is a symbol that represents one of your concerns. X could be “being related.”
(responding to a participant asking for clarifi cation)
It could be said that human beings are constituted by a body of concerns. The word constitutive
means something more than “is a part of.” It means something like “gives the thing itself.” It’s
like your concerns give you your self.
PARTICIPANT
It gives the essence of my self...
ERHARD
You’ve got to watch because I’m going to say “no” to damn near everything you’re going to say,
and everything you say is good, but it’s not quite it. We’re not going to get this nailed down and
I’ll show you why in just a second. You’re in the right ballpark. You’re fine.
(pausing)
So X represents one of your concerns. Let’s just say this represents the concern for being related.
Everybody’s got this concern. A hermit expresses this concern by saying “I’m not related.”
CONCERN
In introducing the distinction concern, Erhard is articulating
another hint at the realm of Being the Forum is designed to evoke.
As with his earlier conversation about moods, he is relocating the
source of participants’ problems from their own agency to the
contextualizing background.
In Being and Time, Heidegger makes a similar move when
he says that “Being-in-the-world has always dispersed itself or
even split itself up into definite ways of Being-in.” To develop
this point, he provides a list of examples, such as having to do
with something, producing something, attending to something,
undertaking, and considering. “All these ways of Being-in,” he says
“have concern as their kind of Being” (BT 83).
Heidegger also distinguishes a category that he calls deficient
modes of concern, in which “the possibilities of concern are kept
to a ‘bare minimum’” (BT 83). Deficient modes include leaving
undone, neglecting, renouncing, and taking a rest.
In everyday use, the word “concern” can have several
meanings. The most common in our current usage is
apprehension, as in “I am concerned for the success of our
project.” But Heidegger and Erhard have used the term in another
way, as a term for an existential characteristic of human beings, “a
possible way of Being-in-the-world.”
Just as human beings are never not in-the-world, they are
likewise never not concerned, since they are concern essentially.
Consider: you cannot locate yourself outside of your concerns,
since the very attempt to do so is itself a manifestation of concern.
Like lightning, which exists only in flashing, a human being exists
always and only as a body of concerns.
With this distinction, both Heidegger and Erhard are
undermining our everyday understanding of the meanings in
our world. In so doing, they are preparing the way for the final
transformational leap, the evocation of the Nothing. ■

SPEAKING BEING
You’ve got a concern for being related otherwise why would you be concerned about not being
related? Clear?
(pausing)
What is our access to what concerns us? Our access to what concerns us is to get at what con-
cerns us in its aftermath. After the thing happens, in hindsight, we can understand. You can’t
even see it before it happens, can you? The already always access that human beings have to
their concerns, the access you inherited, is something like this...
To the right of the X Erhard listed description, defi nition, and explanation.
ERHARD (continuing)
...All of which, will lead to understanding.
(adding “understanding” to the list)
And out of understanding you derive prescriptions, which gives you guidance for how to deal
with what concerns you: ten steps to... Now, you haven’t articulated all your prescriptions, have
you? Because a lot of your prescriptions are contained in the way you are. They’re set in you.
You want to get this! This is one of those things you have to get. This conversation’s got to be
there for the whole Forum.
(pausing)
So you’ve got, for example, golden rules about relations, such as “keep them happy,” “do some-
thing so they’re attached to you,” et cetera. You and I have got great prescriptions. And what
you can predict out of that is that you and I will get better and better at that. A rat can learn
how to negotiate a maze by finding a piece of cheese, but will choose a new tunnel if the cheese
is moved. The difference between a human being and a rat is as follows: a human being will go
down the tunnel with no cheese forever. You know, you’ve been doing the same shit year after
year after year, hoping for a different outcome. What you care about is being in the right tunnel,
regardless of whether there’s cheese or not. Doing the same thing over and over again expecting
different results. That’s the definition of insanity.
(turning to the chalkboard and indicating the empty space to the left of the X)
Nobody looks over here, before it happens.
(writing the word “source”)
That’s where it’s generated, that’s where it’s created. You want to listen up to this next part. Wake
up! Wake up! When you get to the source of something you are no longer limited by it. That, by
the way, is a part of how this works: by getting to the source of things.
(to Wes and Kipp)
I promise that tomorrow I will give them one answer—the answer to what those guys on moun-
taintops in Tibet are looking for.
(pausing)
We’re going to get at concerns from the source side. You don’t get description, definition,
explanation, and prescription—you just get power. You don’t get a PhD out of here. Plato and
Socrates killed that kind of research anyway. They tried it and found out it didn’t work. You read

Lee Iacocca and Al Newheart’s books? They would give everything they’ve got if they could give
what they’ve got to you. Why can’t they?
(pointing to the right of the X on the chalkboard)
Because they write the book in this language, the language of description, definition, and expla-
nation. Because people don’t buy books they can’t understand. That’s why we took your money
before you got in here. When I talk about power I’m talking about something like the freedom
to be, not force, which is the negation of power. I saw a film of a Japanese Judo master, and
never once saw that man stop to think. And I watched the film over and over. The guys he was
fighting stopped to think and got thrown. He was acting out of being something. His opponents,
on the other hand, were acting out of knowing the answers. You see, you can’t throw somebody
unless they’re set some way.
(moving away from the board)
We’re going to talk about another critical thing: the listening that you are. I know you’ve got
questions and comments, and I know some of it didn’t go clunk for you yet. That’s all right.
We’ll get there. I talk in a language designed and crafted to give access to what concerns you at
its source. Now I want to talk about the already always listening that you are. What is the listen-
ing you already always are? For the moment, in this conversation, what you are is a listening.
In the normal course of events, I talk to you like you’re an empty vessel. That isn’t the way it is.
The vessel’s already full, up to the top. It only admits certain things and it expels other things. It
changes certain things. You and I are an already always listening.
(pausing)
When I got this distinction already always listening—not a concept or an idea, but a distinction;
I’m teasing you with that word and you’ll find out about it tomorrow—I began to look at what is
my already always listening. It was very clear to me. The already always listening I was, was “I
know.” I was even a bigger pain in the ass in those days, and a smartass to boot. The only thing I
ever heard was what I already knew. You wake up a certain listening. Your job on this break will
be to discover the listening which you already always are.
(pausing)
Who can see already what your listening is?
PARTICIPANT
The already always listening which I am is that I understand you completely.
ERHARD
Very good.
PARTICIPANT
I’m not good enough.
ERHARD
A lot of us share that one: “The listening I’m going to provide for you is ‘I’m not good enough.’”
Already Always Listening
This is a core distinction of The Forum, a hint that works together
with other distinctions (e.g., mood and concern) to relocate
participants’ understanding of the source of meaning in their
lives. It asks participants to consider that the way they hear (and
see) events and people in their lives is a function of their listening,
rather than being sourced by the people and events themselves.
It would be possible, of course, to engage in a similar
conversation using a more familiar psychological model. Such a
conversation would assert that one’s perceptions are shaped by
one’s attitudes. This way of framing things would be immediately
accessible to anyone whose understanding has been shaped by
th e Cartesian paradigm of an “internal” subject in an objectively
meaningful world.
But locating the source of meaning in one’s listening rather
than in one’s mind situates the process in the world rather than
“in the heads” of participants. This furthers the development of
the Heideggerian model of human being as Being-in-the-world.
Participants in Werner Erhard’s work are frequently coached
to “stay out of your head,” and to “get present.” In Erhard’s
vocabulary, “in your head” is equivalent to “in the past.” This is
where the nature of one’s already always listening is determined:
one makes decisions about people based on past events (“he’s
untrustworthy,” “she’s controlling,” “they never listen to me”), and
these decisions shape the way life occurs in the future.
Erhard has used the analogy of yellow sunglasses, worn for an
extended period of time: eventually, you forget that the sunglasses

SPEAKING BEING
PARTICIPANT
I’m going to figure out what you’re saying wrong.
ERHARD
There’s a lot of crap in school. I don’t want to put the school system down. I have a lot of
respect for teachers. But one of the things you find out in school is that you’re either smart or
dumb. However, there’s no such thing as dumb. I did some work in a school for the disabled.
One student, Jesse, was considered “uneducable.” It was decided, however, that he was educa-
ble enough to be sent to a school to learn to wash cars. On the day I was there, I was told that
Jesse had stuffed a teacher in a trash can. As a consequence, he got sent back to the home for
disabled students, where he could sit around, be friendly, and play. Stupid is a way to survive in
school. Stupid is an act, a racket.
PARTICIPANT
The already always listening that I am is “I don’t want to and you can’t make me.”
ERHARD
You want to get this. A lot of people listen through “life is hard.” A lot of people listen through
“life is a burden.” My dentist told me about his experience as a Boy Scout. No matter what the
scoutmaster had suggested—hiking, swimming, going home—the Scouts always had the same
response: “OH NOOOOOO!” You are this listening. That’s the clearing you are in which life
happens.
PARTICIPANT
Mine is “How can I use this?” “How can I get better?”
ERHARD
Almost everybody’s like that: “How can I use this?” Almost all the power in the world can’t be
used. People don’t use power. Power uses people.
PARTICIPANT
“What are you going to tell me new that I don’t already know?”
ERHARD
Great.
PARTICIPANT
My already always listening is “How can I help you? Do you like me now?”
ERHARD
Beautiful.
are the cause of the world’s yellowness. Like the sunglasses, one’s
way of listening remains invisible because it is always and already
determining one’s point of view, making the way a situation
appears become the way things are. The aim of this inquiry is
for participants to notice these already always ways of listening
in as much specificity as possible. The Forum proposes that the
fundamental elements of human listening are widely shared, even
across cultures; Erhard asserts that there is a “culture of human
being” that transcends national boundaries. All human beings,
for example, listen for positive assessments of themselves, and
for evidence that they are right in their beliefs about the world.
But individuals develop specific variations, and in this part of The
Forum dialogue participants are encouraged to discover their own.
In this way, the dialogue continues to turn participants toward
themselves in an intensely reflexive process. ■

PARTICIPANT
My already always listening is “I’m very clever and I’ll prove it to you.”
ERHARD
See, there are times when “I’m very clever and I’ll prove it to you” is a very workable listening.
But if you’re already always “I’m very clever and I’ll prove it to you,” there are a lot of occasions
that doesn’t match.
PARTICIPANT
I have several of these. My listening is that “I’m not good enough.”
ERHARD
“I’m not good enough” almost always has got another listening, which is “I’m better than you
are.” “I’m not good enough but I’m better than you are.” You want to listen up. These guys are
being authentic about their own inauthenticity. These are not nice people. They are cold, calcu-
lating, conniving people. They are out to get you to like them. And it’s not them. They didn’t in-
vent that. And if this is the opening that I’m providing for the world to occur in, it’s not surpris-
ing how the world shows up. We have done some work facilitating meetings between American
and Soviet representatives. We discovered that the already always listening of the Americans is
“You can’t be trusted for your word; now let’s talk.” This made the results predictable.
PARTICIPANT
My always already listening is “I’m too smart and too quick, and I better not let anyone know
that.”
ERHARD
It’s the “already always way of listening.” I keep losing why the order is important, but there’s
some significance to the order. What is the already always listening that gives you being the way
you are? Believe it or not, the way you are is given to you by your listening.
PARTICIPANT
“You’re boring.”
ERHARD
We’re going to take a break. I want you to consider that the way you are is given to you by your
listening. I’m inviting you to get down to the already always listening, you know, as deep as you
can, however deep that happens to be. Clear?
The Forum adjourned for the final break of the day at 10 pm.
