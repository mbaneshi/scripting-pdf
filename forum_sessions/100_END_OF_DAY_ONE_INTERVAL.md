END OF DAY ONE INTERVAL
Reflexion: The Cartesian Deficiency
At the outset of Being and Time, Martin Heidegger makes a point that might other-
wise be dismissed as obvious: any inquiry into the nature of Being—such as Werner
Erhard’s project, or Heidegger’s own—must always be conducted by human beings,
who as far as we can tell are the only beings who have a concern for the matter, as
well as the only ones who are capable of inquiring. Humans are therefore involved
at multiple points in the inquiry—as the beings who are questioning, as the beings of
whom the question is asked, and as the beings about whom the question is asked.
t
This point is important because of its implications for the inquiry: it will be char-
acterized throughout by reflexion. Reflexion, or self-referentiality, is an important
idea in the work of both Heidegger and Erhard. The term designates a state in which
we are turned toward our selves, as when confronting a reflection.
d
Reflexion requires, first of all, self-consciousness. To say that human beings are
the only beings for whom their being is an issue, is to say that human beings are the
only beings who are self-conscious—or, to say it more simply, we are the only beings
who have a self. While the consciousness of other animals is likely always to remain
a mystery at some level, it is generally agreed that dogs do not reflect upon their
existence. Here, Heidegger emphasizes the centrality of such reflection to human
awareness:
Consciousness is self-consciousness, and self-consciousness
is ego-consciousness or “we”-consciousness. The essential
thing in this is the re-flexive, and in it the “I,” “we,” “self,”
the presentation-to-self and self-production. (EP 64)

Two points in this passage should be noted. The first, like many points that
arise in an ontological inquiry, can seem at first both apparent and trivial: one’s
consciousness always includes consciousness of one’s self. That is, in being aware
of my world, I am always at some level aware of my self as the center of my aware-
ness. It is worth taking a moment to notice this, because the nature of the self, and
the quality of its presence in human awareness, will become a central topic as The
Forum proceeds. Clearly, there are moments in life when one’s self-consciousness
becomes intensified, resulting in either pleasure or discomfort, depending upon

The outcome of this experiment led him to the formulation that has come
down to us as his most famous statement, one familiar to almost every university
undergraduate although generally without a clear idea of its implications: I think,
therefore I am (or in Descartes’ original Latin, Cogito, ergo sum).
That is: if I doubt everything, the only thing of which I can be certain is that I
am the doubter. I can know nothing with certainty except myself, as the one who
is thinking. Further, since I am the only certainty, I am also the inevitable arbiter of
what counts as real. In the Cartesian model of human being that emerged from this
experiment—the model that today we inhabit unthinkingly—the cogito, the “I,” the
being who thinks, is the grounding certainty at the center of things. It is the subject
(Latin subjectum, what lies beneath), while out there, independent of the subject, is a
world of objects (objectum, over against). For humans, Being-in-the-world demands
that we determine the true meanings of those objects. Heidegger scholar Michael E.
Zimmerman describes the situation this way:
Although Copernicus had only recently shattered man’s
illusions about being the center of the physical universe,
Descartes established man as the ontological center:
l
henceforth, the reality of the real was what man asserted it
to be. . . . “To be” meant to be conceived by and through the
subject. . . . Everything got determined and evaluated from
the standpoint of man. (“Beyond ‘Humanism’: Heidegger’s
Understanding of Technology” 222)
It is this paradigm, of the fixed and self-certain human subject, that both Heide-
gger and Erhard are placing in question through their work. As Heidegger points out,
Descartes arrived at his conclusion by accepting as given the nature of the sum—
Being, the “I am.” But Heidegger proposes that the nature of “I am” has never been
fully worked out in the history of Western philosophy, so that behind Descartes’ con-
clusion “there lies hidden a failure to master the basic problem of Being” (BT 127).
T
The Cartesian model itself was the result of an experiment in reflexive thinking.
The heart of the subject–object distinction is “I think something” (EP 62) a premise
P
that turns thinking back upon itself, toward the “I,” and thus toward “the presenta-
tion-to-self and self-production” (EP 64). Presentation demands production, since
the “I” is not there to be reflected upon. In reflecting upon my self, I create my self.
“
But in the Cartesian model, the subject is self-certain—that is, certain of itself
as an entity that persists. The clearing for creation has been occupied. Therefore
Heidegger proposes that self-consciousness, which has in Descartes’ model bent
back far enough to see its “I,” must now bend back further and confront the context
in which the “I” stands essentially, a context that puts its self’s certainty in question.
As we will show, the culminating event of The Forum—the unconcealment of
Being—is accomplished through the evocation of a profound bending-back, reveal-
ing not only the context of the “I,” but in a masterful moment of existential rug-pull-
ing, the context of that context as well.
