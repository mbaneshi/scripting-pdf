Forum Day Three: Session Four

(many responding “yes”)
Remember I said “you become something.” You are worthless. Or to say it with a little bit more
rigor: You now are that you are worthless. Everybody got that? Anybody didn’t get that? Okay
good. Now what we’re going to look at is where did all this mess get generated? Why would
anybody be stupid enough to generate the kind of mess you got? Anybody not clear there’s a
mess here? Do we need to get more mess up for you? Everybody’s got a mess. People in here
are in good shape to start with, and still we’ve got a mess. Can you imagine what it would be
like for somebody who is in bad shape? We screen out people who are in bad shape. We only
let people in here who are in good shape. Most people who have participated in our programs
are above average in their adjustment to life; they are able to handle life on average. What we’re
going to look at here is where did this mess come from?
(pausing)
Now you’ve got to get back to where Jane was. I said I want you to be standing in being a
four-, fi ve-, six-year-old and I want you to tell me—I want to know-what it looked like from
there. So you want to get there in order to get this. You’ve got to be a little girl whose mother
is gone. Either abandoned her or taken away from her, whose only place of belonging is in her
relationship with her father. And that bond that represents for her the only place of belonging,
which represents for her “home”—I don’t mean a building with a family in it—I mean a home,
like being home, home. Being home, home. And that bond, which represents being home: home
is broken. And so what do you suppose you decide when that happens? You got any idea what
you decided when things got to be that rotten?
JANE
I think I decided not to love her and ignore her.
ERHARD
Yeah. Very good. And you’ve been working over on top of that trying to be good about, trying to
love her and trying to respect her? Yes?
JANE
Yes. But I can’t do it.
ERHARD
Yeah. That’s what you decided about the situation. What did you decide about life? Can you
remember? Take a look.
JANE
I would try to outdo her so my dad would like me more than her.
ERHARD
Yeah. That’s great. So that’s looking into the situation. You decided that about the situation with
your stepmom. What I want to know and what I want you to look at Jane is if you can see what
you decided about life itself. Take a look and see what you decided about life itself.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (to the group)
And what you want to be doing is being a four-, fi ve-, six-year-old girl whose mother was taken
away or abandoned her and whose only place of belonging, her only place to be, like be at
home, was her father and that just got smashed. What did you decide about life? You see, you
made all those decisions like she made about herself and about her stepmother, and about how
she was gonna deal with her stepmother, and all that stuff . What I want to know now is what
you decided about life.
(to a participant with raised hand)
I don’t want an answer; I want you to think.
(indicating Jane)
She’ll answer: you think.
(to Jane)
Remember what you decided about life? “I decided...”
JANE
Not to be worthless.
ERHARD
You mean, try to overcome being worthless.
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
That’s what you decided about yourself. What did you decide about life?
JANE
I don’t know.
ERHARD
Okay good.
(to the group)
So I’m going to tell you what you decided about life, because you’ve got one of those. You may
have been three when you made that decision, or ten, or eleven, or twelve, but everybody in the
room made the same decision in some circumstance similar to that which Jane just described.
The only obvious decision such a child could possibly make... And that decision is there is
something wrong here. Where? Where is there something wrong? Not you. That’s the part you
already told us about. There’s something wrong here: in life! There’s something wrong here.
Something is off . There’s something wrong! Can you see that would be an inevitable conclusion
for some eleven-on-down-year-old person? You think about it for a second. If I get you as a
A Violent Way
“The word ‘way,’” says Heidegger, “probably is an ancient primary
word that speaks to the reflective mind of man” (“NL” in OWL 92).
The central notion behind Heidegger’s use of “way” to designate
his process of thinking calls for action and vigilance to maintain
ground gained:
“
To clear a way, for instance across a snow-cov-
ered field, is in the Alemannic-Swabian dialect
still called wëgen even today. This verb, used
transitively, means: to form a way and, forming
it, to keep it ready. Way-making understood in
this sense no longer means to move something
up and down a path which is already there. It
means to bring the way. . . forth first of all, and
thus to be the way. (“WL” in OWL 129–30)
