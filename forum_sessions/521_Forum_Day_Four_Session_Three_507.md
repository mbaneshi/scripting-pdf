Forum Day Four: Session Three 507
talking about here: What we’re talking about here is empowering yourself, not reducing the
risk. We’re not talking about giving you the answers so that you know how to beat people; it
just reduces life and people to a three-year-old. That’s silly. If the point was getting to the top of
Mount Everest, some goddamn entrepreneur would put an elevator on it. The question is: How
powerful and how able can you be in the face of the risk called Mount Everest?
(pausing)
Okay. So we’re almost home. We’ve got two more defi nite steps. And the fi rst step is a step
called responsibility. Remember the choice exercise? You discovered something about choice
that was inconsistent with the interpretation you already had that choice was, and that there’s
a certain power to distinguishing choice the way you distinguished it during the exercise. Same
thing about responsibility. The fi rst thing you want to get is, responsibility is not blame or guilt
or fault. When I say I’m responsible, I’m not saying I did it, or I am to blame or that I’m guilty.
When I say I’m responsible, what I mean is that I stand for being cause in the matter. Not “I
caused it.” It’s a stand for being cause in the matter.
(indicating the “possibility” circle)
And you can’t take a stand without this domain. Without this domain, your stand is a mere
position. Some position you’ve taken on the matter. I don’t know if you’ve been watching this
over the past four days, but your positions have gotten you into a lot of hot water. Your positions
have ruined your life a little bit. Or a whole lot.
(pausing)
Without this domain... See, a possibility is established by taking a stand for something as a
possibility. A position is established by setting something up as something toward which you
are working. Possibility is something you are free to realize, which is diff erent than something
you are working towards. It’s like you’re free to realize whatever it is that you’re willing to stand
for. That’s diff erent from working towards something. Can you imagine: Working toward hitting
the ball over the net in tennis does not make great tennis? Or working toward dancing. My
mother only made one mistake in raising me. She sent me to the Bala Cynwyd Women’s Club to
learn to dance. This was a big mistake.
(laughter)
Knowing where to put your feet is not dancing. I didn’t know that for a long time.
(indicating the “possibility” circle)
The action in this realm is declaration.
(indicating the “story” circle)
The action in this realm is assertion.
(indicating the “what happened” circle)
The action here is expressives. These are Speech Acts, but that’ll get too complicated. To
understand declaration, you have to go to an umpire convention.
See, a possibility is established by taking a
stand for something as a possibility. A position
is established by setting something up as some-
thing toward which you are working. Possibil-
ity is something you are free to realize, which
is diff erent than something you are working
towards. It’s like you’re free to realize whatev-
er it is that you’re willing to stand for. That’s
diff erent from working towards something.

SPEAKING BEING
Here Erhard told the story about the three umpires: the rookie umpire who said he “calls them like
they are,” the experienced umpire who said he calls them “like I see them,” and the master umpire,
who said “They ain’t anything until I call them something.”
ERHARD
That’s declaration. See, the umpire’s got the power of declaration. What is it? If President Carter
wakes up in the middle of the night, says “to hell with glasnost, I’m sending the bombs out,”
what does Rosalynn say? “Shut up, Jimmy, go to sleep.” But if President Bush does it, Barbara
runs for the bomb shelter. Actually, the president doesn’t do that, but never mind; it ruins the
story if I go into that. This power of declaration: That’s what it takes to be responsible, because
being responsible is merely a declaration. It is the declaration that one is cause in the matter. It’s
not a description of the case. It’s not a report on the facts: It’s a place to stand in life regarding
what you care about. When I’m in India, I say the people who are hungry are responsible for
their hunger. And the bleeding hearts have a problem with that. But I’ll tell you, if you are
responsible for your hunger you’re a lot more powerful than if you’re a victim of being hungry.
It’s quite clear to me that the hungry do not want to be hungry, and the hungry would not
have it that way if they had the opportunity to do something about it. It’s quite clear to me that
it takes more courage to live one day there than it takes for me to live ten years. But treating
people as if they have no responsibility is disempowering to people. Now you can’t argue that
you’re responsible, because that’s not a declaration, is it? That’s an assertion, an argument. A
declaration has to be done freely, not coerced. You’ve got to have the power of declaration, and
the power of declaration is a product of freedom. It’s a privilege to be responsible, not a burden
to be responsible. “I am cause in the matter” is a stand for giving yourself power, not a report
on the facts or the circumstances. It’s clear to me that I’m the cause in the matter of people’s
hunger. I make that declaration; it gives me power with regard to the issue of hunger. It’s not a
report on the fact that I did it. It’s a place to stand from which one has power. If it’s not my fault,
if I didn’t do it—but none of that interests me—whose fault is it? Somebody gets to be wrong
and somebody gets to be right. That’s the point.
(indicating the “possibility” circle)
The realm of possibility is also the realm of responsibility. Most people are never going to be
responsible because that realm doesn’t exist; you have to invent it. One of the things we haven’t
told you is what you’re going to get out of being in The Forum. Listen up! What you’re going to
get out of The Forum—yeah you’re going to get a lot of nice things and good things, but that’s
all chicken shit. What you’re really going to get out of The Forum is whatever you’re willing to
stand for having gotten out of The Forum. You’re not going to get out of The Forum what we
gave you because we can’t give you anything of value. You know, all these people are not here
because we have something valuable to give to people. You can’t get anything valuable from
other people. Like “be given it.” Chicken shit is what we get from one another. But you can give
yourself something valuable. You can give yourself something extraordinarily valuable. You
can give yourself something that will last the rest of your life. You can give yourself something
that will make it that your life is never the same. So here’s my promise: I promise that you can
have anything out of The Forum you’re willing to stand for having gotten. I also promise you
What you’re really going to get out of The
Forum is whatever you’re willing to stand for
having gotten out of The Forum.
