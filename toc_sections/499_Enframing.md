Forum Day Four: Session Three 485
not clumsy. There’s no quality called clumsy. Put your hands down for a second. The only
hands I want to see are those who can say “I didn’t get that.” Not an “I have a question”
hand, but an “I didn’t get that” hand.
Seven people stood. Erhard moved to work with Art, and requested of the others that if they got it
when Art got it, they should sit down.
ART
I’m trying to come up with answers. The occurring for life... That’s just how they see it.
ERHARD
It’s not quite right, and what’s not quite right about it is that it’s not a physiological
phenomenon; it’s an ontological phenomenon. The ball exists as slow or fast. It’s not seeing. It’s
not perceiving. The ball exists as slow or fast. It’s not “I see the ball.” The ball is, like existence,
slow or fast.
ART
I’m trying to put that into my life. I used to ride motorcycles and I could ride really fast and I
can see little things in the road at ninety miles an hour.
ERHARD
Because the bike is occurring as slow for you.
ART
Well I’m with the bike, I know how to do that.
ERHARD
No. That’s your explanation. You do not know shit about how to do it. As a matter of fact, go out
on your bike and try to ride it out of what you know. Try it. You race your bike?
ART
Yes.
ERHARD
Try racing your bike out of what you know.
ART
I’d pop the clutch and it would shut off .
ERHARD
Yeah, exactly. You don’t race out of what you know. You race out of the occurring. So let me ask you...
(getting the dictionary and then tossing it at Art)
what does your behaving have to do with what you know?
While Martin Heidegger’s thinking was consistent in its focus
on the question of Being, his philosophical inquiry led him along a
number of paths within this domain. None is of greater relevance to
our current cultural situation than his perspective on technology,
a subject central in his thinking during the last forty years of his
career (Zimmerman, “Beyond ‘Humanism’” 219). In this light then,
it is significant for our inquiry that Werner Erhard has chosen the
name “technology of transformation” for his own project (“The
Heart of the Matter” 1985). In these series of sidebars concerning
technology, we will show how Erhard’s choice of this term
indicates, paradoxically, both a crucial intersection of his work with
Heidegger’s thought, and at the same time, Erhard’s contrast with
what we might call Heidegger’s “racket”—a persistent complaint
with a fixed way of being—concerning modern technology.
Regarding technology, Heidegger is emphatic on two
points. First, we have misunderstood its nature; and second, as a
consequence of this misunderstanding, we have underestimated
its role and influence in the current human condition. Our
problems with technology—which might include overuse,
inadequate mastery, overreliance, and addiction—do not arise
because of some incorrect understanding of technology, for
instance, as a human contrivance, as an instrument for our use,
or as a means to serve our ends. Rather, our problems with
technology have arisen in an epoch in which we can no longer
grasp that “the merely correct is not yet the true” (“QCT” in
BW 313). Our instrumental understanding, wherein anything
worthy of understanding must be able to be put to use, fails to
reach deeply enough to capture technology’s essential impulse.
Here Heidegger develops that particular point:
Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to
technology, whether we passionately aff irm
or deny it. But we are delivered over to it in
the worst possible way when we regard it as
something neutral; for this conception of it, to
which today we particularly like to pay hom-
age, makes us utterly blind to the essence of
technology. (“QCT” in BW 311–312)

SPEAKING BEING
ART (having caught the dictionary)
I just reacted.
ERHARD
That’s your explanation. There wasn’t any reaction. There was a dictionary and hands. You
made up “reaction.” That’s your story about what happened. All that happened was a dictionary
fl ying and your hands moving.
ART
Yes.
ERHARD
You didn’t say to yourself, “Oh, put the microphone under my arm, reach out my hands...” None
of that happened. None of your athletic experience there either. Not one bit of it was there, was
it?
ART
No.
ERHARD
No. Nothing. What was there was fl ying dictionary and moving hands; because your hands—
the motion of your hands—are a correlate of the dictionary as an occurring. Suppose the
dictionary... give me my dictionary back.
(laughter as Erhard receives the dictionary back from Art)
If I throw the dictionary at you so you can’t catch it, what are you going to do? You’re going to
go like this, aren’t you?
(fl inching)
Not like you did the last time. Why? Because you’re not athletic? No, because the dictionary
occurs as uncatchable, and your actions are perfectly correlated with an uncatchable dictionary.
Got it?
ART
Yes, but it just seems foggy. Like I’m always trying to come up with an answer for everything.
I don’t want to use the wrong words here. I can understand but I want to come up with an
answer for it.
ERHARD
No, you want to put it to use. You mean, “Shit, I can’t fi gure out a way to use this yet.”
ART
Well, I don’t see how to apply it to my life.
And in What Is Called Thinking he posits that
. . .the essence of technology is not anything
human. The essence of technology is above
all not anything technological. The essence of
technology lies in what from the beginning and
before all else gives food for thought. It might
then be advisable, at least for the time being,
to talk and write less about technology, and
give more thought to where its essence lies, so
that we might first find a way to it. The essence
of technology pervades our existence in a way
which we have barely noticed so far. (WCT 22)
“
Heidegger concludes this thought with a reversal: “Our age is not
a technological age because it is the age of the machine, it is an
age of the machine because it is the technological age” (WCT 24).
We are reminded of one of the central rhetorical figures Erhard
employs throughout The Forum, in many instances, wherein the
commonplace understanding we have of ourselves as conscious
agents of our lives is thrown into question: “You don’t think it; it
thinks you.” As our thinking enters into this antithetical “figure of
thought”—which rhetoricians term chiasmus—again and again
during the course of The Forum, this way of thinking, as a technology
of transformation, opens us toward new possibilities to be.
But if we hold this figure of thought at a distance, refusing
to follow its course, it loses any of its transformational power. As
scholar Hubert Dreyfus observes, Heidegger’s position with regard
to technology is easily misunderstood as a position, when it is
more appropriate to follow it as a movement. Dreyfus writes that
Heidegger’s “view is so radical that one is tempted to translate
it into conventional platitudes about the evils of technology, so
Heidegger’s ontological concerns are mistakenly assimilated to
ontic humanistic threats about the devastation of nature, the
atomic threat, the media, consumerism, et cetera” (“Gaining a
Forum Day Four: Session Three 487
ERHARD
You can’t apply this in your life. It applies you; you don’t apply it. Weren’t you here earlier to
hear about the truth?
ART
Yes.
ERHARD
All you’ve got to do is get it. It will use you.
ART
And once I try to do it that’s when I screw it up.
ERHARD
Exactly. But that’s a little off  too because that’s another answer.
ART
Right.
ERHARD
Don’t turn it into an answer. All there is to do is to get it. Here’s what there is to get: My actions,
my way of being, my feeling, my thoughts, my self, are a correlate of the world as occurring.
You get that?
ART
Yes.
ERHARD
Good. Sit down. Very well done.
BOBBY
What I got is that you’re talking about “muscle memory.”
ERHARD
What is muscle memory? What’s the diff erence between muscle memory and muscle spirits?
(laughter)
One is in vogue and the other one is not in vogue. “The catching God moved my hands.” What’s
the diff erence between that and muscle memory? They are both explanatory principles. They
both explain what happened. And the only other diff erence is that one is in vogue and the other
is not in vogue. Neither one of them has anything to do with having any access to your behavior.
What does muscle memory have to do with having access to your behavior?
Free Relationship to Technology”). But Heidegger’s focus is a less
apparent threat, namely, the threat posed by “the technological
understanding of Being” (ibid). Technology, for Heidegger, is a
manifestation of a particular way of Being; and it is that way of
Being, rather than technology itself, that poses the real danger. ■
488
SPEAKING BEING
BOBBY
Well then I don’t get it. I thought that’s what you were talking about.
ERHARD
That’s not what we’re talking about. You heard me say muscle memory?
BOBBY
That’s how I translated it.
ERHARD
Yeah: Don’t translate me. I speak perfectly what I mean. If you translate it, you don’t get it.
What I said was, your actions are a correlate of the world as an occurring. Your actions are not a
product of properties inside you including something called muscle memory. You get that?
BOBBY
I heard you.
ERHARD
Did you get it?
BOBBY
Well, I’d have to translate it to get it.
ERHARD
Don’t translate it. Just get it. My actions—the way I act—are a correlate of the world as an
occurring. That’s what there is to get. I don’t act like I act because I’m stupid, or because I’m
smart, or because I’m ambitious, or because I got drive, or because I think positively. They’re
all explanatory principles. They have nothing to do with the source of action. They explain
action beautifully. You could say that you’re possessed by a certain kind of spirit. That explains
it perfectly, doesn’t it? Some people are possessed by good spirits, some are possessed by bad
spirits. Doesn’t that explain action? You don’t like that explanation. But doesn’t it explain
action? Does it not? What’s the diff erence between that explanation and the explanation that I
act because of properties inside me? The only diff erence is that one is in vogue and the other is
now out of vogue. This is a conversation for gaining access to action, not for explaining action.
Remember I told you the fi rst day? Remember that X thing? This side you get explanation, this
side you get access to the source of the action. We’re talking about the source of action, not the
explanation for action. Somebody asks you why you act the way you do, you tell them properties
because what they’re looking for is understanding. You want something to say about your
actions, start dwelling in the possibility, the distinctions, that your actions are a correlate of the
world as an occurring. Is that clear?
BOBBY
It sounds like reaction, but I know that’s not what you mean.
Forum Day Four: Session Three 489
ERHARD
That’s quite right, it’s not reaction. Is the back of my hand reacting to the front of my hand? No.
It’s correlated to the front of my hand, isn’t it?
BOBBY
Right.
ERHARD
Another word for correlation is something like dancing. You and I dance together; you don’t
move because I move. I don’t move because you move. We move in correlation with one
another. Our motion is correlated. That’s what correlated is: It’s like dancing. You need a poetic
understanding of correlation. Like dancing. Clear?
BOBBY
I don’t understand how catching the dictionary is like dancing.
ERHARD
It’s exactly like dancing. And what you’re dancing with is a fl ying dictionary. And Ellen dances
with the ball as uncatchable sometimes and at other times she dances with the ball as catchable.
In both cases, Bobby, her actions are perfectly correlated to the ball.
BOBBY
No thinking.
ERHARD
It’s not a matter of “no thinking.” There may be thinking as well. That’s not the point. The point is
that her actions are perfectly correlated to the ball when she’s graceful and perfectly correlated to
the ball when she’s clumsy. That’s why I got someone who was athletic up, because he looks clumsy
when I throw the ball to him in a way that he can’t catch it. That’s pretty clumsy. When I throw the
ball to him so that it looks catchable to him, he’s very graceful in his dealing with it. Clear?
BOBBY
Yeah.
ERHARD
Thank you.
(addressing another participant)
What’s your problem?
(laughter)
BECKY
I don’t get that when I’m driving fast it occurs slow. I’m not even sure I said that accurately.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Do you remember how hard it was to steer the car when you fi rst started to learn to steer the
car?
BECKY
Yeah.
ERHARD
You had to steer it.
BECKY
Yeah.
ERHARD
You don’t have to steer the car anymore, do you?
BECKY
No, right, I don’t.
ERHARD
The road steers the car. You don’t steer the car. The road steers the car. Because when you fi rst
got into the car your actions were a correlate of what you were told to do. That’s all that was
there for you. “Oh, let’s see, he said to do this! Oh, he said to do that! Don’t do this, do that!”
Your actions were correlated to the telling because that was occurring. There wasn’t any road
out there. The road was just frightening. Now there’s nothing between you and the road. The
road does the steering. You don’t say “Curve. Turn slowly.” Your actions are perfectly correlated
with the road as an occurring.
BECKY
Is it that the steering goes out of existence at some point?
ERHARD
Not quite and that’s a diff erent conversation that’ll get you into trouble. That’s the transparency
conversation. That’s not a part of The Forum. That’s another course. You have to pay more
money to get into that conversation.
(laughter)
Yeah, but nevertheless the steering becomes transparent and the instructions become
transparent. Not that there’s no steering wheel. It’s still there. You know for a great typist,
there’s no typewriter.
BECKY
Right.
Forum Day Four: Session Three 491
ERHARD
There’s the fi nished paper. Whatever he or she is typing from and the fi nished paper. The rest
of it is transparent. There’s no typewriter. If you’re working on a typewriter, you’re not working
fast. You’ve got to produce paper with type on it.
BECKY
I understand all that. I’m going to be very stupid. I am very stupid here.
ERHARD
You’re being very smart. It would be stupid to sit down when you’re not getting something.
BECKY
I have not stood up many times in this Forum when I’ve not understood something.
ERHARD
Don’t editorialize anymore. This is the fourth day.
BECKY
Okay. I don’t get: “I’m in a racing car. I’m going a hundred miles an hour...”
ERHARD
But a hundred miles an hour is an is speed, read off  of a dial. It’s not an occurring speed. See, I
went fast when a hundred miles an hour was slow. I went slow when a hundred miles an hour
was fast.
BECKY
Well what shifted it for you?
ERHARD
You’re into the next question. The next question is going to be “What access do I have to the
occurring?” We’re not up to that question yet.
BECKY
But you’re talking about the end result of the shift without telling me...
ERHARD
Yes that’s right, it’s horrible, isn’t it?
BECKY (laughing)
Yes, I’m frustrated.
ERHARD
I understand. That’s because I want you to have a question. The question I want you to have is:
“How do you gain access to the occurring? I want to alter my behavior. I know I can’t alter my
492
SPEAKING BEING
behavior by telling myself to alter my behavior. I now see I can alter my behavior by altering the
way the world occurs for me. How do I gain access to the occurring?”
BECKY
Got it. Thanks.
ERHARD (to the last standing participant)
This better be really fucking original.
(laughter)
MIKE (the participant who had the “stupid” racket)
I don’t understand. You threw a ball over there, with the gentleman standing over here. He can’t
catch it.
ERHARD
No. You say he can’t catch it. There are athletes who could catch that ball. If that was an ape,
the ape would have caught it. The ball is catchable, but the ball occurs as uncatchable. How
close does the ball have to be to you to be catchable?
MIKE
It depends on how fast the ball is coming...
ERHARD
At a given speed, how close does it have to be?
MIKE
A ball at a given speed?
ERHARD
Yeah, how close does it have to be to be catchable?
MIKE
I have to be able to run to it in time in order to be able to catch it.
ERHARD
And that depends on how fast the ball is moving.
MIKE
Correct.
ERHARD
Very good. And how fast the ball is moving is not determined by a radar gun. It’s determined by
the speed the ball occurs for you. Guys who play baseball for a living, play baseball with big, fat,
Techne
To develop the perspective on technology and the danger posed
by the technological understanding of Being, Heidegger turns,
as he oft en does, to etymology in order to explore the historical
meanings deeply embedded in our language. “In the word,
in language, things first come to be and are,” he says (IM 15).
Therefore the way the world occurs for us today can be traced to
the way it was originally understood and put into language by the
first Western thinkers, the pre-Socratics, who lived at a time when
the increasing complexity of phenomena emerging from the flux
required the development of a deeper understanding of things.
In their response to this challenge, so Heidegger’s account
runs, the Greeks unavoidably set a direction for Western thinking;
and from that meaningful beginning, the “play of Being”—the
evolution of human thinking and thus of human Being—can
be traced through history, culminating in our current view of
ourselves and our world. “What is Greek,” says Heidegger, “is the
dawn of that destiny in which Being illuminates itself in beings,
and so propounds a certain essence of man; that essence unfolds
as something fateful . . .” (EGT 25).
A central artifact in this archaeology of language is the Greek
word techne. Heidegger notes that “the Greeks, who knew quite a
bit about works of art, use the same word techne for craft  and art
and call the craft sman and the artist by the same name: technites”
(PLT 59). Over time, techne came to mean the activities of the
craft sman, primarily the work of making things; so its subsequent
evolution as a term for the functioning of technical instruments is
not surprising. But Heidegger asserts that this meaning is “oblique
and superficial,” and that the word techne “never means a kind of
practical performance. The word techne denotes rather a mode of
knowing” (PLT 59).
But it is knowing in a unique mode: techne is knowing that
creates what is known. It reveals things by bringing them forth for
the first time, a stage in the creative process that precedes the
act of making. When a house or a ship is to be built, it is revealed
before it is produced:
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day Four: Session Three 493
slow, baseballs. Guys like you and me who play baseball once at the company picnic, we play
with very small, supersonic bullets...
(laughter)
...and our behavior is correlated to uncatchable balls. See you were not a creep when you were
sweeping up and missed those spots. The fl oor occurred as clean for you. And you stopped
when it did, like anybody would, like your father would. The fl oor occurred as not clean for
your father. Therefore, for your father you should have kept sweeping.
MIKE
So I could have caught that ball if I saw it big, and slow, over there?
ERHARD
Let me ask you a question. Forget that you can’t reach it because there are people around you. If
I threw the ball over there...
(throwing the ball)
...could you catch it?
MIKE
There’s a possibility.
After receiving the ball back from another participant, Erhard threw the ball farther away from
Mike.
ERHARD
If I threw it there could you catch it?
MIKE
No.
ERHARD
Who said so?
MIKE
I said so.
ERHARD
Because the ball occurs for you as uncatchable.
MIKE
So if it would occur for me as catchable I could catch it.
This revealing gathers together in advance
the aspect and the matter of ship or house,
with a view to the finished thing envisioned as
completed, and from this gathering determines
the manner of its construction. Thus what is
decisive in techne does not at all lie in making
and manipulating, nor in the using of means,
but rather in the revealing. . . . It is as reveal-
ing, and not as manufacturing, that techne is a
bringing-forth. [. . .] Technology is a mode of
revealing. Technology comes to presence in the
realm where revealing and unconcealment take
place, where aletheia, truth, happens.
(“QCT” in BW 319)
“
For Heidegger, what is fundamental in techne, and therefore in
technology, is not the tools and instruments it manifests, but
that it is a way of disclosing entities as entities. Here we find
a harmonic with Erhard’s technology of transformation as the
process of distinguishing distinctions, the distinguishing of which,
entirely in language, discloses worlds within which human beings
have access to acting on and fulfilling new possibilities for Being-
in-the-world beyond what is already and always given for human
beings to be: the in-order-to—the techne—of our technological age.
Techne as the in-order-to discloses entities as raw material and
resources that can then be used up to enhance power and security,
and a correlative way of Being is brought forth in that disclosure,
in that manifestation of the tools and instruments techne calls for,
a technological way of Being that on Heidegger’s view poses great
danger to us.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
There would be the possibility of catching it and your actions would be consistent with catching
it. Let me ask you a question: Have you ever seen a great athletic feat?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
If you don’t move, you don’t catch. Did you hear what I said?
MIKE
If you don’t move, you don’t catch.
ERHARD
Yeah. So. Guys who move have the possibility of catching. And you see them do things you
thought were impossible. You get that now? Is that clear? You don’t move, you don’t catch. And
you only move when the ball occurs as catchable. These are not guys calling for superhuman
eff ort from themselves. These are guys who because of certain ways they are trained see a ball
as catchable like a possibility, which you don’t see. You don’t catch the ball every time I throw it
right there, do you?
MIKE
No, not every time.
ERHARD
Exactly, but you don’t move to catch the ball every time, when I throw it there.
MIKE
Right. The occurring.
ERHARD
Got it?
MIKE
The occurring I don’t understand.
ERHARD
How fast was that ball moving?
MIKE
Feet per minute?
ERHARD
You have no idea, right?
Forum Day Four: Session Three 495
MIKE
No I don’t.
ERHARD
You’ve got to say slow or fast. Don’t you.
MIKE
Right.
ERHARD
How fast does the baseball travel when the pitcher pitches?
MIKE
Maybe sixty miles an hour?
ERHARD
Is that fast?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
Not for guys with high batting averages: That looks like a home run. A ball traveling that fast:
That’s a ball with home run written on it. That’s like me picking up this ball off  the fl oor for
them. It occurs as a home-run pitch if it’s traveling fast enough. And for me, I don’t even see it.
Right?
MIKE
Right.
ERHARD
Same ball traveling at the same speed according to the radar gun, occurs one way for one person
and a diff erent way for a diff erent person.
MIKE
So state what you said about occurring? You mentioned something else...
ERHARD
I said that your actions are a correlate of the occurring. Your actions dance with the way the
world occurs for you, not the way the world is. And not because of something inside you,
Mike. You don’t have properties inside you. You don’t have skill or intelligence or stupidity
or clumsiness inside of you. All you’ve got is your actions correlated with the world as an
occurring.
