Forum Day Two: Session One

response to that is sympathy. Awww, you poor thing. Marsha, thank you very much. And you
want to be clear that when Marsha sits down some of what didn’t resolve for her while she was
standing up, although she was pretty complete about that, the rest of that will resolve for her.
See it’s like a house of cards: when you take one of the cards out, the whole thing falls down.
That whole thing that’s tied together begins to break apart. There’s more attached to that, that
Marsha didn’t tell us. She hasn’t looked all the way through it, and doesn’t want to be up there
for a half hour telling the whole thing. She already gave you one insight. Anger was related to
“people don’t like me.” And “I’m angry at people for not liking me.” So you fi nd the anger and
see that what’s attached to that is “people don’t like me.” And what’s attached to that is I’ve got
to be likeable, and then you get really good at being likeable. Not in some cheap sense, not with
smoke and mirrors; earned like. She produced the results, earned the contribution. Put out the
energy. And she’s gotten really good at it.
(moving among the participants on the fl oor)
The problem is that when it’s there in order to avoid not being liked, about which I’m angry...
Accomplishment doesn’t leave you nurtured. That’s why they have happy hours after work. The
way people relate to their job, accomplishment in their job doesn’t nurture them.

JODIE
Interesting how much things have changed since I stood up.
ERHARD
Amazing, right?
JODIE
Looking good rules my life: completely and utterly.
ERHARD
If you haven’t seen yet that looking good owns your life... if you haven’t seen that yet... I prom-
ise you that that’s the case. You may not have seen it yet. So you don’t know that it is the case.
Like I said, I don’t know the truth, but I’m also not a guy in a diner about this, not a guy with
an opinion. If you haven’t seen this you want to be listening up. Like Mike and I were saying,
you want to listen to this like a possibility...that when Jodie’s fi nished, you want to stand in the
possibility that you don’t own your life, that your life doesn’t belong to you. Yeah, you’ve got
this arrogant façade that you run your life and call the shots. Listen to Jodie’s sharing out of this
possibility: to see how your life is shaped by looking good. And the quality of your life is that
of a life devoted to looking good. Your actions are limited to the span of action being given by
looking good. Stand in that possibility when Jodie is fi nished.
JODIE
What also came up from yesterday when you talked about concept and experience and rein-
forcing each other, my whole life is, that I’ve got to look good and if I don’t look good it doesn’t
Heidegger specifies other characteristics of the “they” which
thereby become aspects of our everydayness. First, because we
generally encounter others in the context of our everyday con-
cerns—the competitive environment of the workplace, as well as
the social and political realms—we experience “constant care as
to the way one diff ers from them, whether one’s own Dasein has
lagged behind the Others and wants to catch up in relationship
to them, or whether one’s Dasein has priority over them and sets
out to keep them suppressed” (BT 164–165). As this complex of
T
concerns takes Dasein over, the withness of Being-with-Others is
interrupted:
“
The care about this distance between them is
disturbing to Being-with-one-another, though
this disturbance is one that is hidden from
it. If we may express this existentially, such
Being-with-one-another has the character of
distantiality. (BT 164)
Further, since the “they” is everyone and no one, it is characterized
as well by averageness:
“
Thus the “they” maintains itself factically
in the averageness of that which belongs to
it, of that which it regards as valid and that
which it does not, and of that to which it grants
success and that to which it denies it. In this
averageness with which it prescribes what
can and may be ventured, it keeps watch over
everything exceptional that thrusts itself to
the fore. Every kind of priority gets noiseless-
ly suppressed. Overnight, everything that is
primordial gets glossed over as something that
has long been well known. Everything gained
by a struggle becomes just something to be
manipulated. Every secret loses its force. This
care of averageness reveals in turn an essential
tendency of Dasein which we call the “levelling
down” of all possibilities of Being. (BT 165)

SPEAKING BEING
come off  well, and that reinforces that I’ve got to look good. And it just goes
around and around.
ERHARD
So when you don’t look good, it reinforces looking good, and when you do
look good, that reinforces looking good.
JODIE
And that there’s been times in my life where, that looking good prevents me
from expressing what I want to express. I could go home to my intimate rela-
tionship and I could go home alone and say “okay, at least I look good.”
ERHARD
Yeah. Listen. Your little $625, that’s chicken shit compared to what you just
got from her. You can’t buy that kind of honesty. That’s more insight than most
people are ever going to have in their entire life. What she told you is that you
don’t own your life.  Looking good owns your life. And life is not about self-ex-
pression. You now know why there’s no satisfaction in your success. Looking
good is gratifying, but not fulfi llment. You notice it’s never enough. Nothing is
ever enough. Nothing. Nothing leaves you whole and complete, nothing leaves
you full of joy. Because that’s not the name of the game. The name of the
game is looking good. It’s the only game in town. You are not living life. You
are looking good. Of course, some people look good by looking bad. A lot of
people look good by being the victim. For example, if you screw up someplace
when you’re a kid and get a lot of attention. People who are unable. It’s a way
of life. There’s an organ for some people called dealing with electrical things,
and they don’t have that organ, you see.

Not long ago they burned women to death in Scotland as a favor because their
souls were possessed. The best people in the community applied the tests to
see if a woman’s soul was possessed by a devil. A lot of what you know to
be true is in the same order as what those Scots knew that led them to burn
women to death. One of those things that isn’t true is that you own your life,
because you don’t. One of those things that isn’t true is that you’re free, but
you’re not. You’re owned by looking good.
JODIE
For me what happened was I was unattractive as a child. I was 5 feet 8 inches
at 12 years old. I always stood out in a crowd, was gawky and all that. Always
popular with the girls and never with the boys. Unattractive all the way through
high school. And when I was 17 the transformation took place. I lost 35 pounds,
got contact lenses and a professional haircut. All of a sudden men liked me.
What showed up for me was that when I was young men didn’t like me.
Collectively, these ways of being—distantiality, averageness, and
levelling down—constitute what Heidegger calls “Publicness,”
which
“
controls every way in which the world and Da-
sein get interpreted, and it is always right—not
because there is some distinctive and primary
relationship-of-Being in which it is related
to ‘Things,’ or because it avails itself of some
transparency on the part of Dasein which it
has explicitly appropriated, but because it is
insensitive to every diff erence of level and of
genuineness and thus never gets to the ‘heart
of the matter.’ (BT 165, emphasis added)
Finally, although all of this would seem to paint an unrelieved-
ly bleak picture for Dasein’s possibility of Being-in-the-world, there
is one more element that, at first glance, might seem to provide
some relief, and might (initially at least) be called “the upside of
the they-self.” In Werner Erhard’s model, it is in fact one of the
“payoff s” in the structure of a racket:
“
[B]ecause the “they” presents every judgment
and decision as its own, it deprives the particu-
lar Dasein of its answerability. The “they” can,
as it were, manage to have ‘them’ constantly
invoking it. . . . It ‘was’ always the “they” who
did it, and yet it can be said that it has been
‘no one.’ . . . .Thus the particular Dasein in its
everydayness is disburdened by the “they.” Not
only that; by thus disburdening it of its Being,
the “they” accommodates Dasein if Dasein has
any tendency to take things easily and make
them easy. (BT 165)
And what Dasein wouldn’t want to make things easy? Avoidance
of responsibility for one’s situation, and off -loading of blame
