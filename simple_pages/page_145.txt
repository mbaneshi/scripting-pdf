Forum Day Two: Session Two

ANGEL
But when I hurt over it, it’s not my decision to hurt over it.
ERHARD
Horseshit! Angel, listen up. When you walk out of here tonight, you are not going to be carrying
your divorce around with you. 
ANGEL
I’ve had it for a long time.
(laughter)r
ERHARD
Wait. Wait. Listen to me. 
(holding a director’s chair and dragging it across the stage, to laughter)r
See this is what you look like. And you wonder why are people looking at you funny. “What the
hell are they looking at? I don’t see anything funny.”
ANGEL
But that’s not my racket. I already picked out my racket.
ERHARD
Wait. Wait. Wait. You’re not a woman, you’re a woman who was divorced...
ANGEL
Twice.
(loud laughter)
ERHARD
Yeah, when you walk out of here, you won’t be carrying around your divorces anymore.
ANGEL
Are you telling me I won’t hurt about them anymore?
ERHARD
What hurts about them is carrying them around. Getting divorced does not hurt. 
ANGEL
Yes it does.
