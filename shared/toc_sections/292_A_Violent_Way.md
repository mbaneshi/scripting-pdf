SPEAKING BEING
KEVIN
I felt like I discovered something I didn’t know before.
WES (pointing to his mouth)
This is where the breakthrough happens. Right here.
ERHARD (coming forward)
Wait a second, this is something we need to handle here. Kevin, did you know that you are
stingy?
KEVIN
Well, that’s kind of a surprise.
ERHARD
I want you to wake up to that. You are stingy, my friend. You think you’re precise and careful,
but you’re actually stingy. You mistake precision and care—which are laudable—for being
stingy. You’re ungenerous. Not big. It does not enroll people into your view. It alienates people.
They don’t fuck with you because you’re too careful and precise. But they don’t like you. It’s
unattractive and it disempowers you. You’ve probably got something to give, but nobody will
get it from you. People won’t “get” from stingy people. I don’t require that you discuss that with
me.
KEVIN
I don’t mind discussing it with you, I just can’t really fi nd in my mind where I’m stingy because
I don’t think that other people feel that I’m stingy. I’ve got other problems, but I’m searching to
fi nd where I’m stingy and I don’t see it.
ERHARD
And that’s what I want you to do. I want you to stay in the question tonight about being stingy.
Are you married?
KEVIN
Yes.
ERHARD
Ask your wife.
(laughter)
I don’t mean stingy with money. I mean stingy with forwarding the action, stingy with
contributing aliveness, stingy with empowerment. Ask your wife, or ask the people that work
for you. Okay, please go on. I don’t mean to cut you off  on that, I just think that it’s more useful
for you to take a look at it overnight, and if you’re wanting to discuss it further I am willing to
do that tomorrow. Is that all right with you?
Forum Day Three: Session Four
279
KEVIN
Sure.
ERHARD
Thanks.
KEVIN
Where was I? I was going to share my breakthrough.
ERHARD
You were going to share your “guess” breakthrough.
KEVIN
Now I’m not even sure what a breakthrough is. In any case, I feel like something happened. I
don’t know.
WES
I don’t want to hear that. You’re either going to say there was a breakthrough, or you’re going to
say there wasn’t a breakthrough. But there’s no guessing. There’s no maybe. There’s no place to
look.
KEVIN
I had a breakthrough because something new and diff erent was happening to me that I hadn’t
experienced before.
WES
No, you had a breakthrough because you say so.
ERHARD
Kevin, breakthrough is a declaration phenomenon. Do you know the meaning of assertion? The
commonplace meaning of assertion?
KEVIN
Yes.
ERHARD.
Breakthrough is not an assertion.
KEVIN
Okay.
ERHARD
It’s a declaration.
280
SPEAKING BEING
KEVIN
Okay.
ERHARD
It’s a stand one takes in the matter. That’s what Wes is discussing with you, to put it in more
technical language.
KEVIN
Okay.
ERHARD
That’s what he means when he says “It’s whatever you say it is.”
KEVIN
Okay.
ERHARD
Like a declaration.
KEVIN.
My breakthrough was my racket, fi nding my racket, which was standing right in front of me all
the time, was that I have to do everything: Every goddamned thing in the world for everybody. I
even have to run this Forum for you.
(laughter)
Now there’s going to be some people laughing, but as The Forum went along, I realized that I
was running The Forum because The Forum wasn’t working out the right way for me, so I was
having to make adjustments in The Forum so it was working out right for me. And so I made
those adjustments. When I wanted to go to the bathroom, I went to the bathroom. And I tried to
come on time, but I was late a couple of times, so I guess that means that I didn’t really try.
WES
No it means you were late.
KEVIN (laughing)
Sorry I said that.
ERHARD
You did try.
KEVIN
Okay. I have to do everything because everybody around me is ineff ective. And I am very good
at it. I can do anything. Fix this, make sure everything gets done, and I can’t let anybody do
anything for me. And I was aware of this, but I never saw this was such a dominant feature of
my life as I did until today. At that point it leaves my mind blank.
Forum Day Three: Session Four
281
ERHARD
Kevin, what was the last thing you just said?
KEVIN
I’m afraid to repeat anything I said you might have found interesting.
(laughter)
No, I said “At that point it leaves my mind blank.”
ERHARD
Got it.
WES
Let me give you some way to look at...
ERHARD
By the way, you’re not afraid of me, you’re afraid of looking bad.
KEVIN
I’m not afraid of you...
ERHARD
That’s right. You’re afraid of looking bad.
KEVIN
I’m a little bit afraid of you.
(laughter)
ERHARD
I’m going to leave you with that delusion.
(laughter)
WES
Inside of what you’ve said, I’ll give you another way of looking at it, or an aspect of it--
something to hang out with tonight along with Werner’s comment about your stinginess: you’ve
been resisting being in a coaching conversation.
KEVIN
Yes.
282
SPEAKING BEING
WES
You’re going to do it your way. Now you’re not the only one in this room that’s going to do it his
way or her way. That’s human being. And that’s the absurdity of human being. Because you’ve
done it all your way and it took you to where you are now—no, sorry—it took you to where you
were before The Forum. So if you tell the truth now about where you were before The Forum,
you’ll see the eff ectiveness of doing life your way. The planet is full of people doing life their
way.
KEVIN
But I’ve done it more so than anybody else in this room.
WES
Always.
KEVIN
No, I’m dead sure of that. See I have evidence. There’s only a few people here who wouldn’t
allow themselves to be taped. And I’ve already talked to the other people. I didn’t seek them out
after that stupid incident here. And I’m getting blocked here.
WES
You’re doing great. You’re actually getting off  it. If I hear you right: you’re willing to tell one on
yourself, right?
KEVIN
Yeah.
WES
A person who resists a coaching conversation never gets coached. That’s
got its...
KEVIN
You’re a great coach but, excuse me, I’ll... I’ll only take from you whatever I’m going to take.
Everything comes through some sort of fi lter, and I only take whatever I think is okay for me,
and the rest of it I think, for the most part you’re on the ball, but where you’re a little screwed
up there, I’m not going to accept that.
WES
Right, of course. I’m not saying “believe everything.” That’s not the other side of what I’m
saying. But it’s not going along with it. We’re talking about a coaching conversation.
KEVIN
It’s all right. I won’t let myself. I’m afraid to put myself in the hands of somebody else
completely. Trust somebody completely.
Forum Day Three: Session Four
283
WES
Okay.
KEVIN
I always have to back it up, in every way I can, so that if they screw up I’ll have a way to get
myself out of the situation.
WES (shifting back and forth)
Yeah. So you’re like this. One foot kinda in, one foot kinda out? In coaching, right?
KEVIN
Professionally I’ve been very eff ective. Been very successful. So why am I here, well because this
doesn’t work in other aspects of my life.
WES
It may not even work in the area you think it does work.
KEVIN
Well I think there’s certain objective evidence there that...
WES
Oh, I know you’re successful and all that stuff , but you have no idea of what could have been
possible.
KEVIN
Oh yeah, I agree, now, looking back, I can see what I could have done better, if I...
WES
Yeah, not even taking into account who you could be in life.
KEVIN
Right.
WES
Rather than just successful, but who you could be.
(to the group)
Kevin’s sharing something powerful in telling one on himself. Remember: people resist being
coached, so we’re not really open to other people’s contribution. And to the degree you do that
you miss the contribution that’s available. Now you can start to see that. You’ll always come up
with a story that justifi es it; there’s always a story that justifi es it: “I didn’t like this”; “they’re
selling me this”; “they said that”; etc. That’s human being.
KEVIN
Oh, I’ve got a lot of those stories.
284
SPEAKING BEING
WES
And there’s another possibility outside the story. And what you got to do to step into it is like
you’re saying, “surrender into something.” I don’t like the word... give something up to get in
there. To be a willingness to be contributed to, to be generous, to be big, to forward the action...
KEVIN
I feel like I need to risk something.
WES
Yes.
KEVIN
And a... I’m going to have to risk something that is really, really important to me, and I’m not
even sure what that’s going to be at this point. That’s going to be really tough. That’s going to be
real tough because I don’t risk anything.
KIPP
Keeping yourself that closed up, that’s what’s been tough. Couldn’t be any tougher than you are
doing now.
KEVIN
Well, I don’t think I have a story beyond that.
WES
Here’s what I’m asking. Look at this conversation about being generous, about being big, about
being coachable, look at this thing about what you’re willing to risk. Tonight. And come back
and share it tomorrow.
KEVIN
Okay.
KIPP
What is this thing you have about being video- taped?
KEVIN
Well, I’m really surprised that more people don’t want to be videotaped. I don’t trust you. I’m
not willing to be videotaped because I don’t trust the organization, WE & A. Because I think
you’ll fuck it up, one way or the other. And once it’s on tape, there it is, there’s a lot that you can
do with it. A lot can happen to it. I lose control of it. So I don’t want to lose control again. So I
don’t see why I should be videotaped, that’s for your benefi t. It’s not helping me. I came here to
help me.
KIPP
And to be clear I am not advocating that you should be videotaped. Just between you and me I
couldn’t quite get what it was all about. So I needn’t fi nd out.
Waiting for the Leap
Central to a dialogue for the presencing of Being, says Heidegger,
is the abandonment of a “thirst for knowledge and greed for
explanations”; we must, instead, be willing to wait, and to “abide
in hope before what is worthy of thought” (“DL” in OWL 13).
Therefore it is of interest that, at one point in his dialogue with the
Japanese scholar, even Heidegger expresses impatience with his
partner’s enigmatic hesitation: “I shall not hide from you that you
are throwing me into a state of great agitation,” says Heidegger,
“especially because all my eff orts to get an answer to my question
from language experts and linguistic scholars of language have so
far been in vain” (“DL” in OWL 28).
Heidegger’s agitation may give comfort to those of us who,
thrown to the eff icient formulation of definitions and concepts,
nevertheless aspire to true philosophic dialogue—conversations
that in the vernacular allow for “deep thinking.” Such dialogue,
which thinks its way into the unknown and trusts the dialogue
itself to find a way out, is a challenging undertaking, especially as a
form of pedagogical inquiry.
The balance of mutuality and directedness in ontological
dialogue is one of the distinctions developed in the unspoken
background of The Forum, and of this book.
The intention that generates ontological dialogue is the
thinking of the unthought, and ultimately the unthinkable.
Paradoxically, such thinking occurs both slowly and suddenly. As
Werner Erhard has put it, you don’t get it and you don’t get it and
Forum Day Three: Session Four
285
KEVIN
What the reaction was all about?
KIPP
No, exactly what you said, that you didn’t trust. The way you got trust, trust isn’t available. Trust
to you is accounting.
KEVIN
Right.
KIPP
So when you’re bored, you get this big accounting sheet with everybody’s name on it.
Kipp did an entertaining demonstration of Kevin’s view of trust: as a matter of accounting, using a
list he carried with him crossing people off  whom he did not trust.
KIPP (continuing)
And you walk down the path of life, with your little pad with everybody’s name on it, and “you
remember twelve years ago we were working on that thing, I wanted to do that thing, but you
got to and I didn’t?”
(crossing off  that person’s name on an imagined  list)
“Seventeen years ago, that company picnic, you walked over to the boss and started talking to
him? And he stopped talking to me?”
(crossing off  another person’s name; pointing at another person)
“You didn’t do anything but someone with a beard like that did.”
(crossing yet another name off  the list, to laughter)
That’s what you call trust.
KEVIN
But my list is way longer.
KIPP
There’s no trust there, just adding up and keeping track.
KEVIN
That’s right.
KIPP
Trust. I’m inviting you to consider that maybe, trust is simply, “I trust you.”
you don’t get it—for a long time—and then you get it, all at once.
This is the moment of insight that Heidegger calls Augenblick—a
moment of vision—and he says it occurs as a leap:
“
There is no bridge here—only the leap. [. . .]
The leap alone takes us into the neighborhood
where thinking resides. [. . .] In contrast to a
steady progress, where we move unawares
from one thing to the next and everything
remains alike, the leap takes us abruptly to
where everything is diff erent, so diff erent
that it strikes us as strange. [. . .] Though we
may not founder in such a leap, what the leap
takes us to will confound us. (WCT 8, 12)
T
On the other hand, he cautions:
“
Leap and vision require long, slow preparation. . . .
(WCT 233)
T
Nobody can in just one single leap take dis-
tance from the predominant circle of ideas, es-
pecially not if he is dealing with the well-worn
tracks of traditional thinking—tracks that fade
into realms where they can hardly be seen.
(“DL” in OWL 36)
Only one who takes the right running start can
leap. Everything is decided by this run, for it
means that we ourselves actually ask the ques-
tions again, and that we, in these questions,
first create the perspectives. (IM 196)
M
Yet it is important to remember, again, that while we are on the
way to language and thinking, we are always within language and
thinking. Therefore the paradox and reflexivity continues, once we
have made that leap:
286
SPEAKING BEING
KEVIN
But I don’t.
KIPP
That’s right. I didn’t say to. I’m not manipulating you into trusting. I’m not advocating it...
ERHARD
He’s not going to get that because he still doesn’t get the distinction between assertion and
declaration. Kevin, did you know that you did your whole number in your response to Kipp?
You did “stingy”; you did “don’t risk”; you did “nobody does it right.”
KEVIN
Yeah.
ERHARD
Like counting down. That was totally automatic.
KEVIN
Yeah.
ERHARD
Not one thing you said had a shred of intelligence in it. I want you to listen to what I’m saying.
It was not an expression of your intelligence. It was not an expression of your common sense. It
was an expression of your act—limited completely to your act. You had no choice in the matter.
It was not some product of an intelligent choice or a commonsensical choice.
KEVIN
I’ll accept that.
WES
So you got the assignment?
KEVIN
Yes.
WES
I just want to acknowledge your willingness to be in this conversation.
KEVIN
I just wanted to say to everyone else in the auditorium, that I’m safe to be around. It’s not
that bad.
“
And where have we leapt? Perhaps into an
abyss? No! Rather, onto some firm soil. Some?
No! But on that soil upon which we live and
die, if we are honest with ourselves. A curious,
indeed unearthly thing that we must first leap
onto the soil on which we really stand. (WCT 41,
T
emphasis added)
In distinguishing the leap, Heidegger continues the reflexivity that
characterizes his thought: we leap to where we already are.
In Being and Time, he says that Dasein “is existentially that
which, in its potentiality-for-Being, it is not yet. . . .  [O] nly because
it is what it becomes (or alternatively, does not become), can it say
to itself ‘Become what you are’ and say this with understanding”
(BT 185–186). Scholar Joan Stambaugh calls this movement of
thinking an “ongoing reaching that belongs to what it reaches”
(ID 14).
As we have noted elsewhere, such reflexivity is central to the
thinking of Zen, as Erhard has observed: “In Zen, one is working
toward enlightenment from and in a context of already being
enlightened” (Bartley 125). ■
Forum Day Three: Session Four
287
(applause)
At this point Jane raised her hand. When she stood, her appearance was strikingly diff erent, and the
participants applauded.
ERHARD (to Jane)
Do you know what they’re clapping about?
JANE
No.
(laughter)
ERHARD
People don’t clap for ugly worthless people, do they?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
So you know what they’re clapping about?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
They’re clapping in part due to your attractiveness, which comes from your being a big,
generous person.
JANE
Hmm hhmmm.
(laughter)
ERHARD
You got that didn’t you? You’ve been big and generous in our conversations, haven’t you?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Good. Nothing to be embarrassed about there. Nothing to be caught in. They’re also clapping for
another kind of generosity and that’s the generosity that they think they see and that I think I see in
your beginning to get off  it. Like getting off  your act about being worthless. All those other things.
288
SPEAKING BEING
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
You think you’re getting off  that? Being ugly and worthless?
JANE
In some ways, but it’ll probably still be with me.
ERHARD
You’re saying that you’re getting off  it but that in some ways it’ll probably still be with you?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Couple things. First off , there’s the diff erence between apes and you and me: you and me
have “probablys.” The ape doesn’t have any probablys, because the ape doesn’t have—listen
up here—don’t get sucked in by her attractiveness...
(laughter)
The ape doesn’t have any “probablys” because the ape doesn’t have any language. Only you
and I have probablys. And we invent those probablys with our mouths. We don’t know that. We
think we’re inventing probablys by extrapolating the past into the future. You understand the
word “extrapolate”?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
Extending the past into the future? You know you take a line that goes like this...
(drawing a line in the air)
And then it goes like that. You’re extending the line from the past into the future.
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
So, you and I think that we say probably based on this mental operation called extending the
past into the future. And that’s why you said “probably” to me, is it not?
Forum Day Three: Session Four
289
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Because given your past you’re probably not going to get off  it entirely, are you?
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
And that’s sensible and intelligent dealing with the future as an extension of the past. Did you
follow what I said?
JANE
A little.
ERHARD
When you said “I probably wouldn’t get off  it entirely,” I said that was an intelligent, sensible
extension of your past into the future.
JANE
Okay.
ERHARD
Good. Now there’s a particular discussion I want to have with you now. Our previous
discussions have been for your benefi t. This one I’m having for the benefi t of the group. I think
you have something to contribute here; that you will be an example that will illustrate what I
want people to be able to see as powerfully as anybody else in The Forum could illustrate it. I
want to be straight with you and tell you that so that I can fi nd out if you’re willing to have this
discussion with me. And you won’t know what that discussion is; you’ll have to take a chance.
I’m not saying you won’t get any value out of it, because you may. I suspect you will. Probably.
(Jane smiles)
Anybody see her smile like that before? Okay, so, you with me? Ready to do this?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Earlier we talked about when you were four, fi ve, or six, and what it looked like for someone
of that age for your mother to be taken away... you get that it would look that way for a child
that age, that “my mother left me, or abandoned me, or she was taken away”? By the way, it
doesn’t make any diff erence that she can’t remember that. Remember you told me you couldn’t
remember that very clearly? But we know it happened and that somebody either told you or you
fi gured it out. It’s not something you remember directly, right?
290
SPEAKING BEING
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Right. That’s there more powerfully than what she remembers. Is there anybody who doesn’t
understand what I just said? Stand up.
(a participant standing up)
I said, what’s there when it’s not recognized—I hate this word but I’m going to use it because
it’s getting late and I want people to understand—what’s there and unconscious is there more
powerfully in terms of its ability to shape your behavior and your feelings and thoughts than
what’s there and is conscious. You got that?
PARTICIPANT
Yeah, I got it.
ERHARD
Okay, so that’s there whether she remembers it or not. And then there was this woman who
came in and broke the bond, which was your haven, with your father.
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
Good. And I said that... I fi rst asked if you made any decisions. You remember that?
(many participants replying “yes”)
Whatever it was, she made some decision. And I said this was a critical point, this was
something that everybody’s got to get. I said: “we talk about it like ‘I decided,’ and maybe you
did, but what really happened is that you became huh huh huh huh huh... You became that
‘I’m worthless.’ It’s not merely ‘I decided.’ That’s not forceful enough. It’s: you became ‘I’m
worthless.’” You remember that, vaguely?
JANE
A little.
ERHARD
Okay, good.
ERHARD (to the group)
You remember that?
Forum Day Three: Session Four
291
(many responding “yes”)
Remember I said “you become something.” You are worthless. Or to say it with a little bit more
rigor: You now are that you are worthless. Everybody got that? Anybody didn’t get that? Okay
good. Now what we’re going to look at is where did all this mess get generated? Why would
anybody be stupid enough to generate the kind of mess you got? Anybody not clear there’s a
mess here? Do we need to get more mess up for you? Everybody’s got a mess. People in here
are in good shape to start with, and still we’ve got a mess. Can you imagine what it would be
like for somebody who is in bad shape? We screen out people who are in bad shape. We only
let people in here who are in good shape. Most people who have participated in our programs
are above average in their adjustment to life; they are able to handle life on average. What we’re
going to look at here is where did this mess come from?
(pausing)
Now you’ve got to get back to where Jane was. I said I want you to be standing in being a
four-, fi ve-, six-year-old and I want you to tell me—I want to know-what it looked like from
there. So you want to get there in order to get this. You’ve got to be a little girl whose mother
is gone. Either abandoned her or taken away from her, whose only place of belonging is in her
relationship with her father. And that bond that represents for her the only place of belonging,
which represents for her “home”—I don’t mean a building with a family in it—I mean a home,
like being home, home. Being home, home. And that bond, which represents being home: home
is broken. And so what do you suppose you decide when that happens? You got any idea what
you decided when things got to be that rotten?
JANE
I think I decided not to love her and ignore her.
ERHARD
Yeah. Very good. And you’ve been working over on top of that trying to be good about, trying to
love her and trying to respect her? Yes?
JANE
Yes. But I can’t do it.
ERHARD
Yeah. That’s what you decided about the situation. What did you decide about life? Can you
remember? Take a look.
JANE
I would try to outdo her so my dad would like me more than her.
ERHARD
Yeah. That’s great. So that’s looking into the situation. You decided that about the situation with
your stepmom. What I want to know and what I want you to look at Jane is if you can see what
you decided about life itself. Take a look and see what you decided about life itself.
292
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (to the group)
And what you want to be doing is being a four-, fi ve-, six-year-old girl whose mother was taken
away or abandoned her and whose only place of belonging, her only place to be, like be at
home, was her father and that just got smashed. What did you decide about life? You see, you
made all those decisions like she made about herself and about her stepmother, and about how
she was gonna deal with her stepmother, and all that stuff . What I want to know now is what
you decided about life.
(to a participant with raised hand)
I don’t want an answer; I want you to think.
(indicating Jane)
She’ll answer: you think.
(to Jane)
Remember what you decided about life? “I decided...”
JANE
Not to be worthless.
ERHARD
You mean, try to overcome being worthless.
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
That’s what you decided about yourself. What did you decide about life?
JANE
I don’t know.
ERHARD
Okay good.
(to the group)
So I’m going to tell you what you decided about life, because you’ve got one of those. You may
have been three when you made that decision, or ten, or eleven, or twelve, but everybody in the
room made the same decision in some circumstance similar to that which Jane just described.
The only obvious decision such a child could possibly make... And that decision is there is
something wrong here. Where? Where is there something wrong? Not you. That’s the part you
already told us about. There’s something wrong here: in life! There’s something wrong here.
Something is off . There’s something wrong! Can you see that would be an inevitable conclusion
for some eleven-on-down-year-old person? You think about it for a second. If I get you as a
A Violent Way
“The word ‘way,’” says Heidegger, “probably is an ancient primary
word that speaks to the reflective mind of man” (“NL” in OWL 92).
The central notion behind Heidegger’s use of “way” to designate
his process of thinking calls for action and vigilance to maintain
ground gained:
“
To clear a way, for instance across a snow-cov-
ered field, is in the Alemannic-Swabian dialect
still called wëgen even today. This verb, used
transitively, means: to form a way and, forming
it, to keep it ready. Way-making understood in
this sense no longer means to move something
up and down a path which is already there. It
means to bring the way. . . forth first of all, and
thus to be the way. (“WL” in OWL 129–30)
Forum Day Three: Session Four
293
big, tough, mature, intelligent adult, and I get you into a bad enough set of circumstances, you
ever remember saying to yourself, “life is fucked”? You see how easy that conclusion is for a
three-year-old, four-year-old, fi ve-year-old? What would it take to come to that conclusion for a
three-, four-, or fi ve-year-old? Nobody comes to your party. Your mother’s mean to you. Almost
anything, right? Real easy, right? Not only easy, it’s inevitable. And it’s not merely inevitable
circumstantially. I’m not going to demonstrate this part to you, I’m just going to tell you. So
I’m not asking you to accept it or believe it: It’s the already always being of human beings—
that there is something wrong. If you’re a human being, you are that there’s something wrong
waiting to happen. Now forget that, because I’m not going to give you enough evidence of
that to make it clear. But I just want you to hear it. What I want you to get is that it’s inevitable
circumstantially. When you were growing up you had a circumstance in which the inevitable
conclusion was, would have to be, “there is something wrong here!” There’s something wrong
innately, profoundly, deeply, at the foundation, there’s something wrong! Life is constituted—
you don’t think in these terms, but—life is constituted as something wrong. Something’s wrong!
And you don’t make that decision. You are that there’s something wrong. Now, you don’t get
that yet; you’re not supposed to get that yet. You’re supposed to follow what I’m saying.
(posturing as the voice in a participant’s “head”)
“Gee, I don’t know. I don’t think that I’m ‘that there’s something wrong.’ I see what you’re saying
Werner, I see that it’s logical that I would have to have come to that conclusion in my childhood,
like a way of being. But gee I don’t get that ‘there’s something wrong.’ I mean, I actually think
there’s a lot of right things. I mean, I don’t live my life out of ‘there’s something wrong.’”
(returning to his own voice)
That’s what you should be saying to yourself, unless it’s already obvious to you that who you are
is that there’s something wrong. For most of you that won’t be obvious yet. What I said will be
obvious: that there is in your childhood and in your early childhood the circumstances in which
you as a child would have to come to the inevitable conclusion that there is something wrong
in life. That part I know you can see. The part you can’t see yet is how to fi t that into today. So
we’re going to fi t that into today for you now. Jane, so, what I said made sense? Like you decided
there was something wrong?
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
You answered the question I asked: Did it make sense?
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
You got any recollection of having made that kind of decision?
One is the way oneself, since until one advances there is no way.
This perspective of his own work emerged early on in
Heidegger’s career as a professor of philosophy. Here he describes
his development of this perspective, as it occurred for him during a
course he taught early in his career:
“
. . . the course was most imperfect. Yet there
was quickening in it the attempt to walk a path
of which I did not know where it would lead.
I knew only the most immediate short-range
perspectives along that path, because they
beckoned to me unceasingly, while the horizon
shift ed and darkened more than once.

This is the first of three points that we want to stress here about
Heidegger’s way: that in entering upon the way to Being, one
is jumping off  into the unknown. This is necessary because the
thinking of Being cannot be understood in advance of its being
thought. Therefore its undertaking is necessarily an advance into
what is not known. But it is important to note that this advance
into the unknown is not simply thinking about some thought
content which we do not yet understand, something that we
know we don’t know. That would be equivalent to examining new
territory using a map; but Heidegger has no map. Werner Erhard
has made this point about his own work: in such thinking, we are
not merely traveling in uncharted waters, but in water that does
not always act like water (“Heart of the Matter”).
This is an important point for Heidegger: to be on the
way we must free ourselves from our subservience to the
“common comprehension,” which is “convinced it was born
comprehending everything” (WCT 77). We must give up judging
each new thought on the basis of whether it is consistent with
our old thoughts, a tendency which is pernicious in our current
mode of thinking.
