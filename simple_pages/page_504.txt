SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Do you remember how hard it was to steer the car when you fi rst started to learn to steer the 
car?
BECKY
Yeah.
ERHARD
You had to steer it.
BECKY
Yeah.
ERHARD
You don’t have to steer the car anymore, do you?
BECKY
No, right, I don’t.
ERHARD
The road steers the car. You don’t steer the car. The road steers the car. Because when you fi rst 
got into the car your actions were a correlate of what you were told to do. That’s all that was 
there for you. “Oh, let’s see, he said to do this! Oh, he said to do that! Don’t do this, do that!” 
Your actions were correlated to the telling because that was occurring. There wasn’t any road 
out there. The road was just frightening. Now there’s nothing between you and the road. The 
road does the steering. You don’t say “Curve. Turn slowly.” Your actions are perfectly correlated 
with the road as an occurring.
BECKY
Is it that the steering goes out of existence at some point?
ERHARD
Not quite and that’s a diff erent conversation that’ll get you into trouble. That’s the transparency 
conversation. That’s not a part of The Forum. That’s another course. You have to pay more 
money to get into that conversation.
(laughter)
Yeah, but nevertheless the steering becomes transparent and the instructions become 
transparent. Not that there’s no steering wheel. It’s still there. You know for a great typist, 
there’s no typewriter.
BECKY
Right.
