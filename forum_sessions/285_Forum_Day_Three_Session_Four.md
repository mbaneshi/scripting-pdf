Forum Day Three: Session Four

consistent with what your racket is up to. So you’re going to have emotions appropriate to what
your racket is up to. If what your racket is up to is avoiding domination, for you Fred, given the
way you’ve got it structured, it’s going to produce a bit of fear. The fear is not the source of it.
The source of it is avoiding the domination of the responsibility for being powerful and able.
FRED
Thank you...
ERHARD
See if you weren’t frightened, you couldn’t justify avoiding. If you weren’t sad you wouldn’t
have a reason.
(to Kipp)
We didn’t deal with reasons yet have we?
KIPP
No.
ERHARD (jokingly)
Why are we so far behind?
KIPP
That’s one of my issues.
(laughter)
ERHARD
Comes up particularly around me, right? Otherwise he’s fi ne. Around me he’s got this issue.
(returning to the topic)
Very important to get this. I want to cut out this crap of explaining your life on the basis of the
way you feel... Fred is giving you the insight that the way you feel is a product of your racket,
not the other way around. You are not molded by your fear. Your fears are there merely to be
consistent with what your racket is up to, so you have got this kind of justifi cation. You are
not run by your emotions. That’s the apparency. Underneath that, what’s driving things is the
racket.
FRED
Part of what I was looking at was also the inauthenticity/authenticity issue. I had it all wired
that I was absolutely authentic. All I had to do was be around and I was authentic. And when I
could accept the fact that I am inauthentic, not like guilt, or like mortal sin, or like confession...

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Hold on. You want to get that. That conversation’s come up in here a lot of times and it’s still
not fl at. Being able to be what you’re afraid you might be gives you power.
FRED
So when I fi nally looked at that I actually had a tremendous feeling of real freedom. I really got
that I’m absolutely inauthentic, it’s just how I am, it’s like telling the truth for the fi rst time,
it gave me a whole playground where I could just be or express or create who I am. I had this
thing tied up with the God issue the lady had brought up before, that I was here on earth to be
the guardian of the playground...
(laughter)
But I couldn’t play. My job was to be this superior, arrogant person who is going to guard and
protect the playground, but I wasn’t going to get to play. But I can’t play. When I fi nally saw that
I’m inauthentic, it was almost a celebration. It’s great! I’m inauthentic. Now there’s a place to
start from to fi nd out who I really am.
ERHARD
Don’t misinterpret what Fred is saying. He means what he says but don’t listen to it wrong. He’s
saying, “embracing what you’re afraid you might be gives you power.” He didn’t say, “make
being inauthentic right.” He said he was able to embrace it. That he was able to be in the face of
it. Whatever you can be with lets you be. Whatever you can’t be with won’t let you be.
FRED
So it’s like a...
ERHARD
It’s almost starting to get clear in here. It’s like “yeah, yeah, I know that, why are you saying it
again?”
FRED
And so it’s like this whole new sense of freedom. You know before The Forum my wife was
telling me, “Fred, you don’t know who you are.” That made me furious. And the truth is I don’t
know who I am. And to be able to get that I’m inauthentic, that’s the most freedom I think I’ve
ever had.
KIPP
It is the most freedom you’ve ever had.
FRED
I was looking at the issue of the empty and meaningless. I’m not sure that I have that like I have
“inauthentic.” And I want to interact for a moment to get it...

might be gives you power.
