Forum Day Three: Session Three 249
PATSY
Sometimes, but when you keep throwing those aces out to the same person for fi fteen years,
for instance...
KIPP
Okay, roll ’em. Bring out the props. Okay...
PATSY
Angel’s my roommate!
The room broke out into prolonged laughter as Kipp made a sweeping motion as if operating a
giant projector.
KIPP
Okay! Roll ’em and weep!
PATSY
I keep doing it and there comes a point where I want to make a choice that I don’t want that
anymore.
WES
It’s not a choice, by the way. If we ever get this across—which is not looking good at this
point—we’ll get to choice.
Wes imitated various possible internal dialogues participants might be having at this point in the
proceedings, including, “Well, what about that multiple orgasm I had that time? Was that empty
and meaningless?”
WES
That’s what you sound like... an internal dialogue machine. The way to blow the circuits on
that is actually getting for yourself that this is empty and meaningless, and this is it.
PATSY
It sounds real simple.
WES
Too simple for complicated minds. You want to see what the complication of your life is, and
the story, and the drama. And this concern you have for giving away your crummy aces. Like
you don’t get it. It’s the giving of yourself away in which life occurs. All the rest is a drama.
It’s all made up. It’s absurd. You’re absurd. But that’s okay, because they’re still going to throw
dirt in your face whether you’re absurd or not. Do you think in a hundred years people will be
discussing your relationships?
PATSY
No.

SPEAKING BEING
Erhard left the room at this point. Wes was on the platform, Kipp down among the group.
WES
You sure about that? Because you and your roommate discuss it a lot, right?
PATSY
Only at work.
(laughter)
WES
I see, so it keeps you from working. I can understand it.
PATSY
While I’m here being human, I want it to be good for me. I want to like what I’m doing.
Wes produced a clipping from a South Korean newspaper.
WES (referring to the newspaper clipping)
This is your life. This is how your life could be with a little more signifi cance. Here’s the title:
“Wife is late with the lunch, kills herself.”
He read aloud the account, which concerned a woman who had forgotten that daylight savings time
was being instituted for the fi rst time. As a result, she had prepared her husband’s lunch late. She
then killed herself.
WES
You think she was dealing with some kind of meaning there?
PATSY
No, not a meaning that I know or recognize, or acknowledge.
(laughter)
WES
That’s meaning. A person kills herself because she served lunch an hour late. That’s the
possibility of a human being’s commitment to having things be signifi cant. You have an analogy
to that in your life. Really. No kidding.
Erhard had re-entered the room.
ERHARD
Did you not get that your story, read by a person in a diff erent culture, would sound like that
story sounded to you?
