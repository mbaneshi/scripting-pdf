Forum Day Four: Session Three 497
(applause)
ERHARD (to another participant)
You got it before. And now some gas has been introduced and now you donâ€™t get it, is that it?
(laughter)
MELINDA
Iâ€™ll keep it short, okay? I have a friend, his son is brain-damaged. His brain works fi ne except
for the part that controls his muscles. He canâ€™t walk. If somebody throws him the ball, itâ€™s
uncatchable.
ERHARD
Sure. If I cut your arms off  and throw you the ball, itâ€™s uncatchable.
(laughter)
Donâ€™t bring up this stupidity: Itâ€™s going to make you look silly. Iâ€™m not talking about some kind
of magic that if you were a rock and the ball occurred as catchable that you would reach up and
catch the ball.
MELINDA
Iâ€™m trying to see where this occurrence is.
ERHARD
Itâ€™s not in your muscles. Stick around. Youâ€™re asking the next question. Look, do you think with your
brain? You know that if we opened up your head and stuck a pencil in your brain you wouldnâ€™t feel it?
MELINDA
Iâ€™ll accept that.
ERHARD
Thatâ€™s the case. You donâ€™t see with your brain. You see through your brain, maybe. It mediates
seeing. You donâ€™t see with your eyes either. You know those things you didnâ€™t see and now you
see? The eyes are a tube through which seeing comes, but not with what you see. And thatâ€™s the
case with the guy with brain damage.
MELINDA
You said itâ€™s an ontological event, but how could an ontological event occur...
ERHARD
Because the ontological event expresses itself through a physical tube. Thatâ€™s trivial.
MELINDA
Thatâ€™s what I donâ€™t get: That an ontological event could occur by cutting off  someoneâ€™s arms.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
No, it does not. I said it canâ€™t. If you canâ€™t get it down the tubeâ€”if the tubeâ€™s blockedâ€”your
brain, your nervous system, your muscles are just a tube to get it down. This is real simple.
Weâ€™re not talking about growing a third arm here. So itâ€™s a trivial conversation to get stuck in
this muscles and bones and nerves thing. Iâ€™m willing to do it if we need to because Iâ€™m someone
who can stay up all night. But thatâ€™s not the conversation that you and I ought to be having
when weâ€™re talking about your being able to behave eff ectively.
MELINDA
Okay.
ERHARD
Growing a third arm is a diff erent conversation. Itâ€™s true that your body is a tube down which
this gets expressed, but itâ€™s only the tube. You know, Iâ€™ve worked with brain-damaged children.
Thereâ€™s no less of a person there. Thereâ€™s less of a person expressed. No question about it. There
are ways to get around the limits of the tubes. Blind people function with the same equipment
Iâ€™ve got at a way higher level than I do. Your body is merely the tube down which this gets
expressed. The tube is trivial.
(Melinda sitting)
About the occurring, and about access to the occurring... We now know that access to action is
in the occurring. You donâ€™t gain access to action through decisions, and making up your mind,
and all that other nonsense. Thatâ€™s a very weak access to your actions. If you checked and
counted up how many times you made up your mind and then checked how many times you
did what you made up your mind to do: very infrequently. Itâ€™s a lousy access to action. Takes
you forever to produce any eff ective action that way. Takes years of practice and discipline to
produce any eff ective action that way. And it isnâ€™t the way to produce action, even taking years
to do it. Itâ€™s just a stupid way to behave and itâ€™s based on a stupid explanation; an ineff ective way
to behave based on a stupid explanation.
(pausing to take a sip from a silver mug)
Now hereâ€™s another hard part. Where does the photographic image occur? Not on the paper!
Because if the photographic image occurred on the paper, everybody who looked at the paper
would see a photographic image. There are people who look at the paper and donâ€™t see any
photographic image, that is to say, no photographic image occurs. Is that clear? Where does
the photographic image occur? This is the question you should be asking: Where does the
photographic image occur?
BARRY
When Iâ€™m shooting...
ERHARD
A photographic image is not shooting.
