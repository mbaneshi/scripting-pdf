Forum Day Four: Session Three 513
WALT
Okay. I’m just trying to handle the steps I’ve taken.
ERHARD
You’re doing the right thing. Go ahead.
WALT
In the previous days here, I’ve been able to get outside of myself. The meaninglessness, and
the meaninglessness of that, was a further push out of myself. And it’s an exciting place to be
for action. I have a concern that this will just remain potential. And I want to use it as soon as
possible so that it does not remain potential, or just a memory.
ERHARD
Your actions will be consistent with it remaining a potential, and consistent with your avoiding
that.
WALT
So I will not avoid that.
ERHARD
I don’t know. I just said your actions would be consistent with the occurring you created.
WALT
Okay. So I say...
ERHARD
Relax. See, relax. All you got to do is be here. Real simple. All you got to do is be here. This stuff
works. It actually works.
WALT
But it’s too great just to let it sit.
ERHARD
No, it’s so great you’ve got to let it sit. All you’ve got to do is take a stand for anything you want
to get out of The Forum.
WALT
Yeah but me... get out of The Forum, it’s puny compared to what you’ve put on the board.
ERHARD
I didn’t say “you,” like limiting it to you, like you, individually. “One can give...” Is that better?
sequence so that the original sending of Being as presence is more
and more obscured in diff erent ways” (OTB 9).
Therefore Heidegger makes his case in the strongest
possible terms: it is not just that our technological way of being is
distancing and impersonal. It is that once we lose ourselves in the
system, we may not be able to find our way out. As the Cartesian
subject, the self-certain lord of the earth, we encountered our
subjective truth in every objective being. But enframed as
resources for technology, “precisely nowhere does man today
any longer encounter himself, i.e., his essence” (“QCT” in BW 332).
We might begin to detect in Heidegger’s discourse the hint of a
persistent complaint reaching a fever pitch:
Enframing does not simply endanger man in
his relationship to himself and to everything
that is. As a destining, it banishes man into the
kind of revealing that is an ordering. Where this
ordering holds sway, it drives out every other
possibility of revealing. [. . .]
The rule of enframing threatens man with the
possibility that it could be denied to him to en-
ter into a more original revealing and hence to
experience the call of a more primal truth. Thus
where enframing reigns, there is danger in the
highest sense. (“QCT” in BW 332–333)
“
The culmination: what has been lost is forgotten.
Enframing disguises even this, its disguising, just
as the forgetting of something forgets itself and
is drawn away in the wake of forgetful oblivion.
The coming-to-pass of oblivion not only lets fall
from remembrance into concealment; but that
falling itself falls simultaneously from remem-
brance into concealment, which itself also falls
away in that falling. (“TT” in QCT 46)

SPEAKING BEING
WALT
It is... for me.
ERHARD
You have to free yourself, not limit yourself. You want to limit yourself: That’s what you want to
do—you want to limit yourself to be sure. You don’t want to take the risk of letting yourself be
free inside the possibilities you create. You want to limit your actions to make sure you realize
your goal. That is not this course. That’s a “Success” course.
WALT
So if I’m going to stay with it here, stay on board, really...
ERHARD
Give yourself some freedom. Create the possibility and then operate out of that possibility.
Operate on what? Whatever the hell’s in front of you, do whatever you do. Stop complicating
it. You’re back in the fi rst day now. You’re asking how to proceed. You’re asking for the
prescription. You go left and then you go right, that’s how you get there; but the real way to
get there is going wherever you’re going. Do whatever you’re doing. Don’t do what you’re not
doing. It’s real easy to follow that instruction.
WALT
And that’s enough?
ERHARD
That’s enough. Who would tell a guy like you that what you need to do is to box yourself in? The
degree to which you need to be boxed in is the degree to which you need to be narrowed. You’re
going to handle that without any help from anybody. Don’t you understand, Walt, I’m not going to
tell you: “Walt, what has to happen is that the sun’s gotta come up tomorrow morning!” That’s going
to happen anyhow. You don’t need to take my time, and I don’t need to take your time to have that
discussion. You don’t need to take our time to have the discussion you want to have, you’re going to
do that anyhow. You’ll get enough of that mixed into the stew. You’ll take care of that. You’re thrown
to that.
WALT
Yeah I am.
ERHARD
Yeah, you’re thrown to that. We don’t talk about what you’re thrown to. It’s not that we don’t
need what you’re thrown to. We do, but why talk about it? We’re going to get that anyhow.
WALT
I was trying to address something else. I was trying to address what you put out there.
At this point, for Heidegger, we let slip our own essential
role as the beings with meaning, the beings for whom Being is an
issue, the clearing in the world for beings to be the beings they
are. “Being’s coming to presence needs the coming to presence
of man, in order to remain kept safe as Being. . .” (“TT” in QCT 38).
But as enframing, we forfeit our role as safekeeper. Lost in the
machinations of the cybernetic system, we not only let the truth of
Being fall into oblivion, but we let fall into oblivion the knowledge
that we have done so, until finally, oblivion itself is forgotten,
and we forget that anything has been lost. “The most profound
oblivion,” says Heidegger, “is not-recollecting” (EP 63).
As evidence that this is already the condition in our world, we
cite the diff iculty that is inevitably encountered in any discussion
of Being, for example, the recurring sense in reading this book of
“What the hell are we talking about?” Being in our time, so goes
Heidegger’s persistent complaint, cannot be recollected, let alone
spoken. ■
