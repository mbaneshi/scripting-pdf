SPEAKING BEING
During the forty-minute break, statements had been written on two of the chalkboards. On one: 
“Promise of The Forum: You can have anything out of The Forum that you are willing to stand for 
having gotten.” On the second: “The commitment of the work is Transformation: bringing forth a 
breakthrough in the possibility of being for human beings.”
As The Forum resumed, Erhard began with a question.
ERHARD
What happened when you were considering the diff erence between your story and what hap-
pened?
PARTICIPANT
I found that I didn’t want to confront my stories.
ERHARD
It’s possible to live in a kind of unconsciousness that we don’t ordinarily call unconsciousness
because we’re not knocked out. It’s an unconsciousness which appears as not being there. What 
you can’t be with prevents you from being. If you mash up the what happens and the story, it
kind of keeps you a little unconscious, because you don’t have to be with it. But when you start
to distinguish the story from what happened, you begin to see the story as a story, and it’s not 
very attractive that way, is it? And it’s something one would mostly avoid being with. There
will be a lot that will come up in here that you don’t want to be with. It’s useful to be with what
you don’t want to be with. What you’ve already learned to be with and survive with--that’s not 
going to be very useful in here, it’s the part you’ve avoided being with here. Anything else?
Thanks very much.
As participants responded to this question, Erhard contextualized their contributions by expanding
the distinctions he had introduced earlier in the day. 
JOHN
I’ve never really liked my wife’s version of the story of how we got married.
ERHARD
When you can recognize a person’s story as their story, you begin to have access to their version 
of the story, so that you’re not stuck with, you don’t have to resign yourself to, their version of 
the story. You have access to diff erent possibilities within the story, but not when it’s mashed up 
with what happened.
JOHN
I got so upset, I left the room, and while I heard the story from another part of the house, my 
upset turned toward wanting to get out of my marriage.
ERHARD  (interrupting)
You didn’t invent thinking about getting out of your marriage. That’s already always in the cul-
ture of being for human beings. You think, “oh well, this happened and that made me think I 
FORUM DAY ONE: 
SESSION TWO
“ 
When you can recognize a person’s story as
their story, you begin to have access to their 
version of the story, so that you’re not stuck
with, you don’t have to resign yourself to,
their version of the story.
