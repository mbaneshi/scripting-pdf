Forum Day Four: Session Two

WES
They are close enough for now. People who sign are participating in languaging. Here‚Äôs what
I‚Äôm including in languaging: picturing, signing, speaking, music-ing: that whole range of
human activities in which communication takes place. The easiest thing for us to talk about is
speaking and listening.
PAULA
What about touching?
WES
What about touching?
PAULA
To me, touching can be communicating.
WES
It can be, and it may not be...
PAULA
Are you including it...?
WES
...if it‚Äôs an intentional communication.
PAULA
Okay.
(sits down)
WES
Okay, so problems occur in languaging. Is there anyone who cannot see that? Clear enough.
Close enough... for government work.
(laughter)r
DAVID
I‚Äôm not really clear that the problem is in languaging.
WES
Yeah. Where is it? Give me a problem you got?
DAVID
Fully participating in the projects that I do. Getting excited by the projects.

SPEAKING BEING
WES
There are two things there: fully participating and getting excited.
DAVID
Getting really excited about the projects I‚Äôm involved in.
WES
‚ÄúI do projects. I‚Äôm not excited. That‚Äôs a problem for me.‚Äù Is that how it goes?
DAVID
Yes.
WES
See the languaging there?
DAVID
Yes.
WES
That‚Äôs where the problem is.
DAVID
Thank you.
WES
You‚Äôre welcome.
(laughter; David sits)
So now that we‚Äôve put it into the domain of languaging, we have some access to them. If you can
locate problems where they are, that is to say, in languaging, you now have an access to dealing
with problems that will allow for a breakthrough in problems. We‚Äôre now going to deal with the
real breakthrough in problems. This is what you all need to get is the next thing I deal with. I
deal with a little bit more, but this is it. You want to fi nd the specifi c box... I want you to imagine:
Languaging has many boxes. Make believe: Many boxes in languaging; many possibilities for
things to occur in within languaging. We want to fi nd the specifi c box that problems occur in.
Problems occur in one box only for human beings. It doesn‚Äôt show up as a box, because people
think their problems are ‚Äúout there,‚Äù shows up like ‚Äúout there.‚Äù But now that you know that it
shows up in a box in languaging, we have to fi nd the box. Knowing the box will give us some
power with regard to our problems. It‚Äôll actually blow the whole thing open.
Wes moved to the chalkboard, drew a square, and wrote ‚Äúproblems‚Äù inside it.
