SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
If you were going to design a universe you would not design growing up like people do it. But
that’s the way it is. It’s messy. The single most important issue between parents and children is
that they love each other. And that’s almost never the discussion. It doesn’t make you a better
person to clean your room. The point is to have a little straightness in the conversation. It’s a
diffi  cult process at best. There are no experts on raising children. No one has the code. It’s very
powerful what Edna is talking about. You’ve got to keep getting off  it with your children too.
The interesting thing about kids: if you get off  it with them, they’ll get off  it with you. When
you’re being straight with them, it occurs to them they might be straight with you. Great, Edna.
Good stuff , really good stuff .

Where’s Jane?
The young woman who had spoken the previous day (Day Two, Session Four) about her father and
stepmother stood.
ERHARD
What happened to sad?
JANE
I don’t know.
ERHARD
Do you really not know, or do you not want to talk about it?
JANE
I think I was sad because... it was all up here. I was scared so much.
ERHARD
What do you mean “I think”?
JANE
I know.
ERHARD
What you’re saying is “I was feeling emotional because I was standing up in front of a group of
people.” What happened that you feel that way? Don’t say “I don’t know” ever again.
JANE
Something that happened that I don’t remember.
ERHARD
Can you remember a time when you stood up in front of a group of people?
book to provide further context concerning questionable political
judgments of Heidegger the “man,” which put at risk the substan-
tial innovations and contributions of Being and Time and of his
other writings.)
The contribution and innovation of Heidegger’s thinking that
is central to our study includes his particular path of thinking,
a path that reached beyond the academic context in which he
worked and thrived, and into the domain of ontology. Working
persistently in this domain for more than five decades, he strove to
honor the discipline of philosophy by committing his life to under-
mining its foundational concepts.
Embedded throughout his many published volumes is a per-
spective on philosophy, and its relation to language, that strongly
resonates with Werner Erhard’s approach to ontological inquiry.
In the lectures published as The Fundamental Concepts of Meta-
physics, for example, Heidegger is elusive regarding philosophy’s
nature. Philosophy is
“
not some mere gathering of knowledge that we
can easily obtain for ourselves any time from
books, but (we know this only obscurely) some-
thing to do with the whole, something extreme,
where an ultimate pronouncement and interlocu-
tion occurs on the part of human beings. (FCM 4,
M
emphasis added).
He is emphatic on one point: “Philosophy is philosophizing. . . .
It itself is only whenever we are philosophizing.” Philosophy
emerges in acts of languaging; and if it is authentic philosophy, it
emerges newly in each iteration, “however much we seem merely
to be repeating the same thing” (FCM 4). Frequently in The Forum,
Erhard calls out the participants whom he hears codifying their
experiences as beliefs. Authentic philosophy rips space open newly
in every articulation; it is philosophizing that never calcifies into
philosophy.
Further, Heidegger suggested the direction that philosophical
dialogue should move in the current epoch. The task concerns at-
tunements, which are ways of being open to the world. A human be-
ing is never just open; we are always open in some particular way.
Forum Day Three: Session One

JANE
Last summer at a camp.
ERHARD
What happened?
JANE
Everybody had to say their problem out in the open and I didn’t want to do it. They kept asking
over and over until I did.
ERHARD
Can you remember a time before that speaking in front of a group of people?
JANE
I didn’t.
ERHARD
What about in school?
JANE
I never talked in school. I sat in the back.
ERHARD
When were you frightened about standing up?
JANE
In the fourth grade.
ERHARD
What happened in the fourth grade?
JANE
Well my fi rst year of fourth grade I had to stay back. And most of the people—well this is my
story—made fun of me for staying back, and said I was stupid.
ERHARD
How do you do in school?
JANE
Fine. I get good grades.
ERHARD
Are you happy in school?
“
Our fundamental task now consists of awakening
a fundamental attunement in our philosophizing.
I deliberately say: in our philosophizing, not in
r
some arbitrary philosophizing nor even in phi-
losophy in itself, for there is no such thing. It is a
matter of awakening a fundamental attunement
which is to sustain our philosophizing, and not
the fundamental attunement. Accordingly, there
is not merely one single attunement, but several.
(FCM 59)
The task that Heidegger proposes is the distinguishing of the
fundamental attunements that, unrecognized, generate human
thinking. His purpose here is not to ascertain these attunements,
since that term implies objective knowing (i.e., the stance of a sub-
ject whose goal is to learn about something separate from itself),
but that I am never separate from my attunements:
“
Perhaps such a thing as the fundamental attune-
ment we are seeking is precisely something that
cannot be ascertained in this way by an inquiry. It
could be that it pertains to ascertaining an attune-
ment not merely that one has the attunement,
but that one is attuned in accord with it. (FCM 60,
M
emphasis added)
To know an attunement, then, requires
w
entering it.
Such inquiry makes a special demand of the inquirer, a
demand always present in ontological inquiry, and one that has
made scholarly or scientific studies of Werner Erhard’s work
problematic. Central to The Forum’s promise is the possibility of
choosing an authentic existence; but participants—even those
with scholarly credentials—cannot ascertain whether that result
has been produced by hearing about the experiences of others in
The Forum, or even by observing their behaviors. In this domain
of knowing, the evidence lies in one’s own lived experience; and to
further challenge scientific inquiry, it is in the nature of one’s lived
experience that what it means is up to you.

SPEAKING BEING
JANE
No.
ERHARD
Would you like to be happy in school?
JANE
Yeah. Well, I feel if I was happier about being in school I’d get better grades.
ERHARD
Okay. You’d also be happier in life.
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
What happened in the fourth grade?
JANE
The biggest thing I remember is I asked people to come to my birthday party, and no one
showed up for it.
ERHARD
What did you decide when nobody showed up?
JANE
That no one liked me.
ERHARD
I want you to be right there—back in the fourth grade. You didn’t merely decide “nobody likes
me.” You became “nobody likes me.” You’ve been living over top of “nobody likes me.” And
when nobody likes you, it’s threatening to stand up in front of a group. Do you get that?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Is it true that nobody likes you?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
How old are you when you’re in the fourth grade?
The scientific mind boggles; but these principles lie at the
heart of a phenomenological approach to knowing, such as those
of Heidegger and Erhard: you must yourself be fully available for
the outcome; and the insight of the transformational Augenblick is
that the meaning of my life is determined by the stand I take on it.
But I must first take a stand.
¥
Attunements are already always there. I am never not attuned
in some way to the world; there is never a naked “I” which sub-
sequently becomes attuned. We are attuned from inception, but
without being conscious of our attunement. This is tricky territory.
“
We speak, aft er all, of the unconscious. In one re-
spect it is at hand, and yet in another respect it is
not at hand, namely insofar as it is not conscious.
This strange ‘at hand and yet at the same time not
at hand’ arises from the possibility of being con-
scious of something unconscious. (FCM 61)
M
Attunements live in the realm that Werner Erhard calls what we
don’t know that we don’t know. The Forum functions to unconceal
the “blind spots” that constitute this realm.
“
The distinction between not being there [Nicht-
Dasein] in the sense of the unconscious and being
there [Dasein] in the sense of what is conscious
also seems to be equivalent to what we have in
mind by awakening, specifically by the awakening
of whatever is sleeping.
(FCM 61)
M
Therefore Heidegger begins with a proposal that attunements are
sleeping, and we want them awake so that they can be dealt with,
and their influence on our world can be perceived. “Awakening
means to make something wakeful. . . .  To awaken an attunement
means, aft er all, to let it become awake and as such precisely to let
it be” (FCM 60).
Forum Day Three: Session One

JANE
Seven or eight years old.
ERHARD
You’ve got an eight-year-old running a seventeen-year-old’s life. You know that?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Is it true that nobody likes you?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
You are “nobody likes you,” even though you know that’s irrational. But it wasn’t irrational for a
eight-year-old, was it?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
If I told you a story like yours to a seventeen-year-old, you’d understand that makes sense for an
eight-year-old to think that, right?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
But would you understand that in a seventeen-year-old woman?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
No, it’s not the thinking of a seventeen-year-old woman, is it?
JANE
Right.
ERHARD
You want to know about yourself that you put your identity together, you put your persona
together. You built yourself. Your life will be a compensation for not being liked. And the way
But Heidegger quickly pulls us up short here: on second
thought (and it is in the pattern of Heidegger’s thinking that there
are many second thoughts for any proposal), are we really, in
awakening an attunement, letting it be? On the contrary, Heideg-
ger suggests that attunements function best as themselves when
they are not recognized as themselves. If, he asks,
t
“
we make an attunement conscious, come to know
of it and explicitly make the attunement itself into
an object of knowledge, we achieve the contrary
of an awakening. The attunement is thereby pre-
cisely destroyed, or at least not intensified, but
weakened and altered. (FCM 61)
M
Therefore, considering attunements as being asleep, and therefore
to be awakened—since it may destroy the very phenomenon to
which we wish to attend—may not be the best path for inquiry; so
Heidegger proposes another direction for our thinking:
“
How oft en it happens, in a conversation among
a group of people, that we are ‘not there,’ how
oft en we find that we were absent, albeit without
having fallen asleep. This not-being-there, this be-
ing-away [Weg-sein], has nothing at all to do with
consciousness in the usual sense. On the contrary,
this not-being-there can be highly conscious. In
such being absent we are precisely concerned
with ourselves, or with something else. Yet this
not-being-there is nonetheless a being-away.
(FCM 63)
M
A human being can only be away because its being has the charac-
y
ter of being-there. As being-there, “a human being—insofar as he
or she exists—is, in his or her being there, also always already and
necessarily away in some manner” (FCM 63):

SPEAKING BEING
to get to the possibility beyond that is to really see what happened when you were a seven- or
eight-year-old little girl, and you got held back. Look out there.
(indicating the group)
What do you see?
JANE
A lot of people staring at me.
ERHARD
You can’t see that. You can’t see “people.” You can see that person and that person and that
person. You can’t see people. “People” is a story. Look out there and see if you can see persons.
JANE
Yeah I see persons.
ERHARD
What are those persons doing?
JANE (looking)
Some are nodding. Mouths open.
ERHARD
Is there anybody out there not liking you?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
Just persons, right? Some of them may not like you. Because there are people “not liking
people” waiting to happen. And there are seven- and eight- year-olds like that, aren’t they? The
other thing: I want to know if you’re going to hide the rest of your life. You know you’re hiding?
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
You know you’re not expressing yourself?
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
That’s your racket, isn’t it?
“
. Being
away does not mean: not being at all. It is rather
a way of Da-sein’s being-there. The stone, in its
being away, is precisely not there. . . .  Only as long
as we are-there [da-sind] can we be away at all,
and vice-versa. Hence being away, or this ‘there
and not there,’ is something peculiar, and attune-
ment is connected in some as yet obscure way
with this peculiar manner of being. (FCM 64, 65)
M
An attunement, then, is not being asleep; nor is it being unconscious.
It is more akin to being away while there. But it is never not there,
which is the traditional perspective of moods and attunements,
as “feelings”—emotional events that come and go as a result of
circumstances (FCM 64).
M
We have so far discovered some things that an attunement is
not. “Therefore,” says Heidegger, “we must now ask: How are we
to grasp attunement positively as belonging to the essence of man,
and how are we to relate toward man himself if we wish to awaken
an attunement?” (FCM 65).
He beckons us to follow him by suggesting this example:
“
A human being we are with is overcome by grief. Is
it simply that this person has some state of lived
experience that we do not have, while everything
else remains as before? If not, what is happening
here? The person overcome by grief closes himself
off , becomes inaccessible, yet without showing any
animosity toward us; it is simply that he becomes
inaccessible. . . . Everything remains as before, and
yet everything is diff erent, not only in this or that
respect, but—irrespective of what we do and
t
what
we engage in—the way in which we are together is
y
diff erent. (FCM 66)
M
Heidegger is asking us to look closely at the situation. It is not that
I myself feel grief; but that the attunement of our being with one
another has shift ed.
Or consider someone who is always in a good humor and
“brings a lively atmosphere with them” (FCM 68); or “someone who
ERHARD (continuing)

JANE
Yes.
Erhard stood very close to Jane at this point, his tone intimate.
ERHARD
Because it’s something you do and something you are that you wish wasn’t so.
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
What’s the payoff  for hiding? Does hiding make you right that people don’t like you? It makes
you right about the fact that you’re not something to be liked.
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
Who does it make wrong?
JANE
Them.
ERHARD
Yeah. Because they don’t like you. And you don’t have to be responsible for relating; don’t have
to be dominated by relationship. Who you are is, “I’m not in the game.” Right?
JANE
Right.
ERHARD
How does it have you dominate? It keeps people trying to get in, doesn’t it? People around you
are puppets trying to get in. They’re puppets dangling on the hand of your racket. Right?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Are you physically attractive?
JANE
No. I’m ugly inside.
through their manner of being makes everything depressing and
puts a damper on everything” (FCM 67). These attunements are
“not at all inside in some sort of soul of the Other,” nor are they out
there at hand in the world in some way (FCM 66).
Where and in what way are they, then?
“
In positive terms, attunement is a fundamental
manner, the fundamental way in which Dasein is
as Dasein. . . .  And precisely those attunements to
which we pay no heed at all, the attunements we
least observe, those attunements that attune us
in such a way that we feel as though there is no
attunement there at all, as though we were not
attuned in any way at all—these attunements are
the most powerful. (FCM 67–68)
M
In attunements, “we first meet ourselves—as being-there” (FCM
68). They shape our world, give us our ways of being, and provide
the context for our philosophizing. Heidegger says that the task
of philosophy is to “awaken” them in some sense, and then . . .
well, we correct the situation, of course. This is the usual human
impulse: fix the problem by altering or replacing the attunement.
Heidegger and Erhard, on the other hand, are proposing a
diff erent response, one distinguished throughout their thinking
and most importantly referred to by Heidegger as appropriation;
appropriation lets the situation be, distinguished as itself.
“
[A]wakening attunements is a manner and means
of grasping Da-sein with respect to the specific
‘way’ [Weise] in which it is, of grasping Da-sein as
Da-Sein, or better: of letting Da-sein be as it is, or
can be, as Da-sein. Such awakening may perhaps
be a strange undertaking, diff icult and scarcely
transparent. If we have understood our task, then
we must now see to it that we do not suddenly
start to deliberate about attunements again or
t
even about awakening, but inasmuch as this
t
awakening is an acting, we must act in accordance
t
with it. (FCM 68)

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
What’s the “ugly inside”?
JANE
My feelings.
ERHARD
Like worthless. Like being nobody.
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Do you know you made yourself “nobody”? At some point in your life something happened and you
became “I am worthless.” It’s not that you think it. It’s that you are it. It’s not that you are worthless
because you think you’re worthless. It’s the other way around. You are that you are “worthless” and
therefore you think it, and you see it, and you listen it, and you smell it, taste it and touch it. You’re
already always worthless. You’re worthless waiting to happen. Did you hear what I said?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Now, sometime today, or at the worst, tomorrow morning, you’re going to fi nd out about this
worthlessness business. But all I want you to get right now is that at some point in your life, something
happened, and you made yourself worthless. It’s not that you are naturally worthless. At some point
today you’re going to fi nd out what you are at the bottom, and it ain’t worthless. It’s something else.
You made “being worthless.” And you’re clear there’s a payoff  to being worthless, right?
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
What does it cost you to be worthless?
JANE
Love, happiness, self-expression.
ERHARD
Mostly self-expression. Look out there. Does it look diff erent?
JANE
Yes. Just people.
Therefore, early in The Forum, Erhard exhorted participants not
to try to fix anything they think is wrong with them, or to lose any
“moods” they think may get in their way. Attunements are us; they
are the raw material of The Forum.
Letting them be is diff icult and not as transparent as it
sounds.  ■
Forum Day Three: Session One
193
ERHARD
Stick around. It’s not over yet.
The Forum leader, Wes, now came onto the platform.  Erhard remained in the room.
WES
Good morning. We’re going to do the letters now. What do you think the purpose of this
assignment was? The results of The Forum are not something deep inside yourself. Here’s
what’s deep inside yourself: gunk, blood, undigested food. There’s no place deep inside yourself
where life’s really happening. It’s important to get this because you’ve got to know where The
Forum takes place to have The Forum be eff ective for you. You need to know where The Forum
occurs so you can have it occur powerfully. Okay, here’s the hard part: where does The
Forum occur?
(pointing to his mouth)
The Forum occurs right here. The Forum occurs in languaging. That’s where The Forum
occurs. It doesn’t occur where you thought it occurred. The Forum occurs in a conversation,
which becomes you, or it doesn’t. How do people keep getting results one to two years after The
Forum? Generating the conversation is how you make The Forum eff ective ongoingly. What
you want to master is what occurs in being able to say and listen what The Forum is. Ultimately,
The Forum occurs in your ability to say it—to say the possibility which it is. To those who didn’t
do the assignment, who didn’t write the letter: You blew it. Listen to what people share: You
could’ve gotten that.
A Japanese woman, Ayako, rose to share her letter addressed to one of her parents: she had come to
The Forum to make a career decision, but found herself discovering that her racket is “being nice,”
and that this was what was in the way. She stopped reading to explain to Wes the circumstances
behind her letter.
WES
You want your letter to be so clear it doesn’t need to be explained. You should’ve put that in
your letter.
AYAKO
I’m confused. I’m in the gap between living in the US and having a Japanese background.
WES
You don’t sound confused to me. You may be disempowering yourself to call it confusion. Not
knowing like a possibility may be a very powerful place to be in life. One of the most powerful
places to be in life is to let be “not knowing.”
(to the group)
I invite you to stop being confused.
