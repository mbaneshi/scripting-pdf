Forum Day One: Session Four

it does is add a dimension. So there’s an exponential leap in the possibility of Being. And that’s
maybe why there are these outrageous claims people make about what they got from participat-
ing in The Forum.
PARTICIPANT
Couldn’t you add a fourth slice to the pie? Intuition? What you know but don’t know that you
know.
ERHARD
Yes, that’s very legitimate. You didn’t get the point about dimensionality?
(adding it to the model on the board)
In a point, you have no degrees of freedom. In a line, one dimension, you get one degree of free-
dom, and so on, and we simply expand on that one degree of freedom. The Forum adds a new
dimension. You get an exponential leap of possibility.
PARTICIPANT
It’s what you don’t know that you don’t know.
ERHARD
Exactly.
PARTICIPANT
How do you get there?
ERHARD
You’re in here four days and one evening. You’ll see how it’s done by the end of the third day.
Anybody else here not get this dimensionality?
PARTICIPANT
Could you say that what The Forum does is to “unconceal” a new dimension?
ERHARD
Yes, that’s a technical term for it. It’s called unconcealing. What begins to get you into this
domain of “don’t know that you don’t know” is to dwell in the power of the question. We’re
hungry for answers, addicted to answers. People hate being in the question; they want the
answer. You don’t get answers. Light gets shed on what you are concerned with. That’s not the
way you and I are usually. The way you and I are is hungry for answers. What do I do about it?
The beginning of gaining access to what you don’t know that you don’t know, the beginning of
establishing a new dimension for being, a new dimension for living, is to start to dwell in the
question, develop the courage and the stamina and the wherewithal to orient yourself around
“
Can you formulate a question, the asking
of which is empowering? So that you’d be
willing to stay in the question?

SPEAKING BEING
questions the asking of which makes a difference. There are certain questions, just the asking of
which impacts people’s ability in life. See, you and I don’t look for those questions, we look for
answers, which you can only find in what you know that you don’t know. This is about devel-
oping questions the asking of which gives access to what you don’t know that you don’t know
about your life, about other people, and about living. The Forum is about developing a certain
muscle for asking questions the mere asking of which makes a difference.
Here Erhard read a passage from Heidegger’s On the Way to Language (page 13), in which Heidegger
recounts his dialogue with a Japanese scholar:
ERHARD (reading)
“Japanese: We Japanese do not think it strange if a dialogue leaves undefined what is really
intended...”
(to the group)
That’s not very familiar to most of us, is it? In our dialogues we want to get definition very
quickly. We want it explained.
(continuing to read)
“...or even restores it back to the keeping of the undefinable.
Inquirer: That is part, I believe, of every dialogue that has turned out well between thinking be-
ings. As if of its own accord, it can take care that that undefinable something not only does not
slip away, but displays its gathering force ever more luminously in the course of the dialogue.”
(to the group)
That means putting it back into “don’t know that you don’t know.” It’s a harmonic with what
I read you earlier about the unspoken. See, what you’re looking for here is light, not answers.
Insight you can’t create by the numbers. What you want if you’re going to create is light, not
answers. Listen up, goddammit!
(continuing to read)
“Our dialogues with Count Kuki probably failed to turn out so well. We younger men chal-
lenged him much too directly to satisfy our thirst for handy information.”
(to the group)
You’re here listening for answers. You’re listening for what we call “tips.” Nothing worthwhile in life
can be gotten there by ten steps. Or twenty steps. You can’t dance knowing where to put your feet.
(continuing to read)
“Inquirer: Thirst for knowledge and greed for explanations never lead to a thinking inquiry.
Curiosity is always the concealed arrogance of a self-consciousness that banks on a self-invent-
ed ratio and its rationality.”
(to the group)
What that all means is that this greed, this thirst, the question, “How am I going to use this?”—
that’s a product, according to this guy, of a concealed arrogance, an arrogance that everything
