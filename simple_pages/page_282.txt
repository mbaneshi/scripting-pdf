SPEAKING BEING
The Forum resumed at 10 pm, following the dinner break. The four TV monitors located at 
various points in the room have been turned on, so that the participants now have the option of 
watching the action on the monitors rather than directly. Erhard and Kipp began by interacting 
with participants’ sharing. 
KIPP
Who would like to share what’s happening?
ANDY
I had a terrifi c time at dinner. And anything beyond “I’m here and I speak” is a joke. Well yeah 
because, nothing. It’s great.
KIPP
When it is.
ANDY
Yeah.
KIPP
When it’s great it’s great, when it’s not it’s not. Thank you very much.
DON
I basically got tired of listening to people’s shit. A lot of the observation I made was people fell 
back into story telling. And I stopped listening. I didn’t enjoy it.
KIPP
Okay.
DON
I didn’t enjoy that at all.
KIPP
So what?
DON
Well, yeah, right. I just like the meat and potatoes. That good stuff .
KIPP
But so what? You’ve got it that it should be some way.
DON
Right.
