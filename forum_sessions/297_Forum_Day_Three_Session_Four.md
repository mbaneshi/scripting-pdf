Forum Day Three: Session Four

WES
Okay.
KEVIN
I always have to back it up, in every way I can, so that if they screw up I’ll have a way to get
myself out of the situation.
WES (shifting back and forth)
Yeah. So you’re like this. One foot kinda in, one foot kinda out? In coaching, right?
KEVIN
Professionally I’ve been very eff ective. Been very successful. So why am I here, well because this
doesn’t work in other aspects of my life.
WES
It may not even work in the area you think it does work.
KEVIN
Well I think there’s certain objective evidence there that...
WES
Oh, I know you’re successful and all that stuff , but you have no idea of what could have been
possible.
KEVIN
Oh yeah, I agree, now, looking back, I can see what I could have done better, if I...
WES
Yeah, not even taking into account who you could be in life.
KEVIN
Right.
WES
Rather than just successful, but who you could be.
(to the group)
Kevin’s sharing something powerful in telling one on himself. Remember: people resist being
coached, so we’re not really open to other people’s contribution. And to the degree you do that
you miss the contribution that’s available. Now you can start to see that. You’ll always come up
with a story that justifi es it; there’s always a story that justifi es it: “I didn’t like this”; “they’re
selling me this”; “they said that”; etc. That’s human being.
KEVIN
Oh, I’ve got a lot of those stories.

SPEAKING BEING
WES
And there’s another possibility outside the story. And what you got to do to step into it is like
you’re saying, “surrender into something.” I don’t like the word... give something up to get in
there. To be a willingness to be contributed to, to be generous, to be big, to forward the action...
KEVIN
I feel like I need to risk something.
WES
Yes.
KEVIN
And a... I’m going to have to risk something that is really, really important to me, and I’m not
even sure what that’s going to be at this point. That’s going to be really tough. That’s going to be
real tough because I don’t risk anything.
KIPP
Keeping yourself that closed up, that’s what’s been tough. Couldn’t be any tougher than you are
doing now.
KEVIN
Well, I don’t think I have a story beyond that.
WES
Here’s what I’m asking. Look at this conversation about being generous, about being big, about
being coachable, look at this thing about what you’re willing to risk. Tonight. And come back
and share it tomorrow.
KEVIN
Okay.
KIPP
What is this thing you have about being video- taped?
KEVIN
Well, I’m really surprised that more people don’t want to be videotaped. I don’t trust you. I’m
not willing to be videotaped because I don’t trust the organization, WE & A. Because I think
you’ll fuck it up, one way or the other. And once it’s on tape, there it is, there’s a lot that you can
do with it. A lot can happen to it. I lose control of it. So I don’t want to lose control again. So I
don’t see why I should be videotaped, that’s for your benefi t. It’s not helping me. I came here to
help me.
KIPP
And to be clear I am not advocating that you should be videotaped. Just between you and me I
couldn’t quite get what it was all about. So I needn’t fi nd out.
Waiting for the Leap
Central to a dialogue for the presencing of Being, says Heidegger,
is the abandonment of a “thirst for knowledge and greed for
explanations”; we must, instead, be willing to wait, and to “abide
in hope before what is worthy of thought” (“DL” in OWL 13).
Therefore it is of interest that, at one point in his dialogue with the
Japanese scholar, even Heidegger expresses impatience with his
partner’s enigmatic hesitation: “I shall not hide from you that you
are throwing me into a state of great agitation,” says Heidegger,
“especially because all my eff orts to get an answer to my question
from language experts and linguistic scholars of language have so
far been in vain” (“DL” in OWL 28).
Heidegger’s agitation may give comfort to those of us who,
thrown to the eff icient formulation of definitions and concepts,
nevertheless aspire to true philosophic dialogue—conversations
that in the vernacular allow for “deep thinking.” Such dialogue,
which thinks its way into the unknown and trusts the dialogue
itself to find a way out, is a challenging undertaking, especially as a
form of pedagogical inquiry.
The balance of mutuality and directedness in ontological
dialogue is one of the distinctions developed in the unspoken
background of The Forum, and of this book.
The intention that generates ontological dialogue is the
thinking of the unthought, and ultimately the unthinkable.
Paradoxically, such thinking occurs both slowly and suddenly. As
Werner Erhard has put it, you don’t get it and you don’t get it and
