SPEAKING BEING
There’s no such thing as action, there’s only action-in-the-world; “world” as an occurring and
“action” are correlates of one another. That ball looked uncatchable to you. That’s how the ball
looks to somebody called “clumsy.” It looks uncatchable, and their actions are those of anybody
else, athletic or not, their actions are the same, because the actions are not a product of a
property inside one’s self called “athletic.” People’s actions are a correlate of the way the world
occurs for them. Anybody didn’t get that?
JERRY
I didn’t get it.
ERHARD
What didn’t you get? Did you get that we are talking about the source of action?
JERRY
I heard it.
ERHARD
There’s a diff erence between hearing and getting. Did you get that we’re talking about the
source of action? Is that clear to you?
JERRY
Yes.
ERHARD
So what didn’t you get? “I didn’t get...”
JERRY
I didn’t get that it’s the same thing when you throw the ball over there to him as when you
throw it to her and she doesn’t catch it.
ERHARD
That’s good. That’s clear. Now we can have a forwarding discussion. So, his actions down here
are correlated to an uncatchable ball, yes?
JERRY
Correlated to me means “goes along with.”
ERHARD
That’s close enough for the moment, yes. His actions are consistent with—go along
with—an uncatchable ball, yes?
JERRY
Yes.
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day Four: Session Three 479
ERHARD
Now, you think that the ball is uncatchable or isn’t uncatchable. I’m telling you that his
actions are not correlated to an “is uncatchable.” His actions are correlated with an “occurs as
uncatchable.” Occurs. You get the diff erence?
JERRY
I get the second, what was the fi rst...?
ERHARD (throwing the ball to a participant in another part of the room from Jerry)
Let me ask you something: Was that ball uncatchable for you?
JERRY
Yes.
ERHARD
No, because there’s a possibility of your catching the ball.
(throwing the ball the same way again)
Catch that ball. What happened?
JERRY
I didn’t catch it.
ERHARD
Because it occurred as uncatchable for you.
JERRY
Right.
ERHARD
Is that clear for you?
JERRY
Yes.
ERHARD
And if I’m a certain way, and the ball goes like  that,
(throwing the ball again)
the ball occurs as uncatchable for me. If I threw the ball and it occurred as uncatchable for you,
you wouldn’t have put your hand up like that, you would have acted “clumsy.” So your actions,
and her actions, and my actions, and his actions are all a correlate of the ball as an occurring,
not the ball as an is. That ball is going a certain rate of speed and it is within a certain number
of inches from your body.
Event Ontology
To begin, try this: imagine that the phenomena in the world
around you—people, trees, dogs, the sky—do not merely exist, but
are at every moment coming into existence. Imagine that when you
look at a tree, you aren’t observing a thing that is just there, but
an event. The tree is occurring. Instead of just a tree, like a thing,
you are in the presence of a happening: treeing. The happening is
ongoing, as the tree withdraws from the world and emerges—its
emergence and withdrawal so correlated in time that they are
perceived only as a quality of aliveness. You sense the withdrawal,

SPEAKING BEING
JERRY
I hear you. I’m worried that I’m missing what “is” means.
ERHARD.
Good. Listen up. You told me what you didn’t get. We would say, you and I, because of the way
you and I are, that the ball is going at a certain speed, and it is arriving at a certain proximity to
your body at a certain place. So we would say it is catchable depending on how fast it’s going
and on how far it was when it started coming at you...
JERRY
I have a problem concentrating on what you’re saying. I’m sorry. It’s like you’re talking too fast
or I’m thinking too slow.
ERHARD
I understand: We’re talking in a place where you have your foot nailed to the fl oor. It’s all right.
You’re doing great. Just tell me to slow down.
JERRY
Thank you. Please slow down.
ERHARD
We’re contrasting an “is” ball and an “occurring” ball.
JERRY
I understand an occurring ball, I don’t understand an “is” ball.
ERHARD
The ball is going at a certain speed, yes? And the ball is in your range of vision for a certain
amount of time.
JERRY
Okay.
ERHARD
That’s what is, you and I would say. It is going at a certain speed. And it is in your range of
vision for a certain amount of time. And you and I would say if it is going in this envelope of
speed—not faster than this, but in this envelope of speed—and if you have that much time to
watch the ball going at that speed, the ball is catchable.
JERRY
Right. I got it.
ERHARD
So that’s an is catchable ball. But you and I do not act on “is ball”; you and I act on “occur ball.” It
doesn’t make any diff erence how fast the ball is going. Your actions are correlated to how fast the ball
and the absence, as a persisting background that contextualizes
your experience of the presence. In the presence of something,
you sense the possibility of nothing.
Heidegger scholar Susan Schoenbaum has proposed an
interesting analogy as a clue to this world of emergence and
withdrawal: the way the diff erentiation between foreground and
background occurs for us in our visual consciousness:
In this diff erentiation, the background is deter-
mined as receding into indetermination as the
foreground becomes more or less determinate.
The phenomenal movement of foregrounding
and backgrounding, the coming to be back-
ground and the coming to be determinate fore-
ground, all occur simultaneously. This complex
movement of determination is originary in the
sense that it makes simultaneously possible
(a) the determination of background (however
indeterminate) as background and foreground
as foreground, (b) the consequent appearing
of determinate beings that appear (in the
foreground), and (c) the coming into being of
the entire constellation as context or world,
including background, foreground, and the
determinate movements of diff erentiation. All
these aspects belong to an originary event of
diff erentiation of background and foreground.
(A Companion to Heidegger’s Introduction to
Metaphysics, 149–150, emphasis added)
“
In other words, there is much going on in our perception of the
world that happens below the level of awareness even as it shapes
that awareness.
Imagine now that this is the nature of reality: that we live
in a world of be-ings, rather than merely beings, a world that is
renewing itself in each instant. And imagine further that you, as a
being in that world, are likewise emerging newly in every moment.
Imagine that “you” are not a fixed phenomenon, but that, like
the tree, you occur, for yourself and for others, and withdraw, and
occur, a new being in each occurrence. Imagine that a human

occurs as going. See you and I think that the guy who hits the ball over the net in tennis all the time
has skill. No. That’s a guy for whom the ball comes over the net very slowly and very big. That’s the
diff erence between him and me. He does not have some property inside himself that I don’t have.
JERRY
So you’re using “occurs” as the way the ball is perceived? The way the ball is seen or perceived?
ERHARD
Yeah, I don’t like that and it’ll get you into trouble if you push it too far, but yes, that’s a correct
understanding. It’s not mere perception. It’s not mere seeing. It’s an ontological phenomenon,
not a physiological phenomenon. It’s the way the ball occurs. So here’s what I’ve said so far.
Your actions are not a correlate of “is.” Your actions and her actions and my actions and his
actions are all perfectly correlated to the occurring ball. And why some people look clumsy to
us is because we don’t realize their actions are correlated to the occurring ball; we think their
actions are correlated with the is ball. It is going a certain speed. It is in their sights for a certain
amount of time.
JERRY (laughing)
This sounds pretty simple to me now.
ERHARD
Yeah, it is.
JERRY
Everybody else have that?
ERHARD
Yeah, they got it listening to you.
JERRY
I guess my problem was I didn’t know what you meant by occurring and what you meant by is.
ERHARD
You and I don’t dwell in the distinction called “occurring.” You and I dwell in the distinction
called “is.”
JERRY
Why not?
ERHARD
A thing called stupidity.
JERRY
Kids dwell in occurring, don’t they?
being is an event—an event with language, and therefore very
diff erent from trees, but nevertheless a happening, like all of the
other beings in the world, where absence is always the background
accompaniment to presence. Nonexistence is the background for
your existence.
According to Heidegger scholar Charles Guignon, such a
world is what Heidegger was aiming to retrieve for human beings.
Guignon calls it an event ontology, an alternative to the substance
ontology that has dominated Western thinking, in which the world
is just a collection of things. Such a world of events may sound
tenuous and risky; but consider: might you, reborn anew in every
moment of now, be more alive to existence? Might such a world be
more vivid, more challenging, more engaging? Might living in that
world keep you on your toes, or on the edge of your seat?
Heidegger proposes that the reality we have imagined here
was what the world was like for the early Greeks. This is also the
nature of the transformation that occurs in The Forum, where
participants get Nothing as a liberating context for their lives. ■

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
They dwell in “is” too. Nobody coaches occurring. They coach is. They tell you how to hold the
racket.
JERRY
How about the guy who wrote the book Inner Tennis. He coaches occurring, right?
ERHARD (walking toward Jerry and then standing right in front of him)
He doesn’t talk about it that way, but he does “occurring.” What makes Tim Gallwey’s coaching
eff ective—Tim coaches a shift in the occurring; he’s not trying to change the behavior. No
matter how much I know how to behave, I’m going to behave as a correlate of the occurring.
I’m not going to behave like I know how to behave. That’s true about you because you didn’t
always behave the way your mother told you to behave. By the time I was fi ve years old, my
mother told me everything I needed to know about how to be a decent human being. I had all
the knowledge I needed. Didn’t make a damn bit of diff erence. I was a rat. You too. You tell
yourself what to do, but you don’t do it, do you?
JERRY
Sometimes.
ERHARD
Yeah. Sometimes. But you always, your actions are always correlated with the occurring of
the world. That dictionary fl ies through the air, your hands will move in a dance with that
dictionary, because your hands are correlated with the occurring of the world.
JERRY
Yeah, I believe that, but it sounds like I missed something.
ERHARD
Don’t believe. I want you to get it.
JERRY
Well it feels like I’m missing something, because you’re saying it like it’s a big deal.
ERHARD
Yeah, it is a big deal. I’ll tell you what the big deal about it is: Stop trying to change
yourself. Stop trying to put properties inside of yourself. Stop trying to get yourself to do
the right thing. Alter the way the world occurs for you, and your actions will naturally
alter. You get that?
JERRY
Yeah, I believe I get it.
Forum Day Four: Session Three 483
ERHARD
Good. It’s simple. I understand. Took you a long time to get that simplicity, yes? Anything is
simple. It just takes a long time because we’ve got to get all the garbage out of the way. You
didn’t get what I said even when you felt that you got what I said.
JERRY
I felt I wasn’t listening. I had the problem that I didn’t hear what you said. I wasn’t listening.
ERHARD
I understand. You didn’t hear me because you were listening to your barriers to hearing what I
was saying. And the barriers to hearing what I was saying were provoked by what I was saying.
We’ve been doing that for four days here. We say stuff  that we don’t expect you to get. We say
stuff  designed to drive the barriers up in front of your face. Then we keep dealing with the
barriers. Then you start to drop the barriers. Then all of a sudden it’s empty and meaningless,
and then it’s like “well, obviously it’s empty and meaningless. Why didn’t you just say that in
the beginning?”
(laughter)
Clear? Give me my ball back. Thanks.
(applause)
Let me say it all over again. Here’s what I want you to get out of this. Your actions are not the
actions you want, or the actions you decide. They’re not a product of your past; your actions
are a correlate of the world as an occurring, not the world as an is world, but the world as an
occurring world. Your actions are perfectly correlated to the way the world occurs for you. If
the world occurred for you like it occurs for the person you most despise, you would act like
the person you most despise. No shit. Really. I know you think you’ve got goodness and all
that bullshit inside you. Go to the doctor and have him open you up so you can see. Cut that
noise out. Your actions are a correlate of the world as an occurring. You want me to throw the
dictionary a couple more times so you can see? Now the question is, “Well, what generates this
occurring?” We’re going to get to that, but not until you get... see you’re almost as stupid as you
were when you came in here, because you’re sitting out there trying to decide whether you
agree with this or not.
(laughter)
“Is that right? Do I agree with that? I practiced tennis for ten years, and that practice really
made me a good player. And I remember learning buh buh buh, and that made me better at
that.” Wrong! The practice and the learning alters the occurring. Staying in the conversation
Jerry and I were having: you know, you train an athlete. Most people train athletes like they’re
grooving in behavior, so you do it repetitively, that’s what training is, right? Repetition. So you
do it over and over and over again so you can do it automatically. Horseshit. Anything you do
automatically lacks skill, lacks power. You wouldn’t want an athlete who acted automatically.
You want an athlete free to act with the world he or she has to act within. What happens is,
Your actions are not the actions you want, or
the actions you decide. They’re not a product
of your past; your actions are a correlate of the
world as an occurring, not the world as an is
world, but the world as an occurring world.
“
484
SPEAKING BEING
you take behavior out when you train an athlete with repetition. You take behavior out, not add
behavior. He has to do this. You don’t want him to do that. Let him keep doing that and he’ll
stop doing that if the training’s any good, and he’ll be free to do anything. When he’s free to do
anything, he’ll deal with the ball eff ectively. You don’t need to tell people “step back when the
ball bounces in front of you.” Because you’re never going to be eff ective when you’re trying to
remember what to do when the ball bounces in front of you. When the ball bounces in front
of you as catchable, you step back, because stepping back is perfectly correlated with the ball
that bounces in front of you and is catchable. Stepping forward is what you do when the ball
bounces in front of you and it’s not catchable.
(pausing)
Is it starting to get through? Not “do you agree with it?”: Are you able to stand in the possibility
that my actions in life are not a product of internal properties? My actions in life aren’t a product
of anything. My actions in life are a correlate of something. What they are a correlate of is the
world as an occurring. For example, if the world occurs as threatening, your actions will be
perfectly correlated with a threatening world. The question is not: “Is the world threatening?”
The question is: “Does the world occur as threatening?” It’s not that one person is strong and
the other person weak. You think you’re strong, let me put you in a set of circumstances that
occur suffi  ciently threatening and you will cower. People who cower are not weaklings. The
world occurs for them as overwhelmingly threatening. People who are musical: Music occurs
for them in a way that it doesn’t for those of us who are not very musical. The keyboard does
not look like it does to you and me to a pianist. Totally diff erent. I did an experiment driving a
racecar for a year. Didn’t know anything about racing cars when I started. Didn’t even drive for
the most part when I started. I had a license. I hadn’t been in a gas station for something like ten
years. When I started out, the car went very fast. Really fast! I mean overwhelmingly fast. Except
for the guy on the sidelines who had the stopwatch. For him it was going very slow. But the
slower the car went for me, the faster my times were. I could see divots in the roadway a quarter
of an inch deep and put the edge of my tire in that divot. The car got real slow. Real easy to
drive a car slowly. You get into a race car and drive it slowly, it’s easy. Takes no talent, no ability,
which was very good in my case. The slower the car goes the faster the times are, because action
is a correlate of the occurring. How many people in here manage other people?
(several participants raising their hands)
How many other people in the room raise children? That’s managing people, by the way.
(more raising their hands)
Good. Put your hands down. You want to know why your kids act like they do? Because
the world occurs for them in such a way that their actions are a perfect correlate. They do
not do what you tell them to do. No shit. And if you think they’re doing what you tell them
to do, you’re wrong. Their actions are a correlate of the way the world occurs for them.
People murder not because they are bad people. Nobody has ever found bad inside anybody.
People murder because murder is a perfect correlate to a certain kind of occurring. The
law recognizes that by recognizing self-defense. Never mind how they explain it. Ellen is
not clumsy. Her actions are perfectly correlated with the way objects occur for her. She’s
