KIPP 
“I’m not smart enough to sweep” never happened.
Erhard joined Kipp on the platform.
ERHARD
Mike, it’s something you became. Did “I’m not smart enough to sweep” ever happen?
The tone here was very quiet and still—the interaction was delicate, Mike somehow fragile.
MIKE
I don’t understand; I need more clarifi cation. I know that I missed places.
ERHARD
Did it happen that you missed places?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
Did it happen that your father pointed out where you missed?
MIKE
Yes. 
ERHARD
Did “I’m not smart enough to sweep” ever happen?
MIKE
I guess not. 
ERHARD

”
just have that thought. You became “I’m not smart enough to sweep.” You made yourself into
“I’m not smart enough to sweep.”
Erhard sat on the edge of the platform facing Mike. The room was very still. Kipp sat nearby on the
platform edge.
MIKE
I became “I’m not smart enough to sweep.”
