SPEAKING BEING
JACOB
When you say “it,” I get that you mean life, but something is going to work out.
ERHARD
Really?
JACOB
Yeah.
ERHARD
Are you the Pope?
JACOB
I anticipate that something’s going to happen.
ERHARD
Yeah and evil spirits are going to come down and invade people’s bodies and make them sick.
JACOB
And I’ll go home and not get enough sleep to come back here tomorrow. 
ERHARD
And you know what? You will if you do and you won’t if you don’t. And your anticipation is 
meaningless because it’s going to be just the way it is.
JACOB
Yeah, anticipation means that there’s going to be a stupid story attached to what happened. 
ERHARD
Sure. And you’re going to anticipate anyhow. See, it’s a perfect trap, Jacob. That’s the thing 
Californians don’t understand. The attempt to get out of the trap constricts the bars of the 
prison. The attempt to get beyond the “this-is-all-there-is” keeps you in the trap. Trying to get 
out of the prison keeps you in the prison. And not trying to get out of the prison keeps you in 
the prison. Everybody’s got a form of making it. Even not making it for some people is a form of 
making it. Either way is an attempt to get out of the trap and that keeps you in the trap. There is 
no outside the prison. Outside the prison is inside the prison.
JACOB
It’s the spot you are in.
ERHARD
Yes. You’re only going to be in the spot you’re in.
The attempt to get beyond the “this-is-all-
there-is” keeps you in the trap. Trying to get
out of the prison keeps you in the prison. And
not trying to get out of the prison keeps you in
the prison.
