Forum Day Four: Session One

ERHARD
You understand it with the understanding you have, I get that. You understand it. Period. Now
what is it that’s missing?
GLORIA
It makes me feel like shit.
ERHARD
Yeah, you don’t like it. The man did not say you would like the truth. As a matter of fact, the
fi rst thing the truth will do is piss you off . Didn’t you notice people in here?
GLORIA (laughing)
I almost got into a fi ght last night because of that.
ERHARD
Because of the truth?
GLORIA
Because of it was empty and meaningless. She was a Forum staff  person so it made me really
want to punch her.
ERHARD
This is turning the truth into shit. How could empty and meaningless generate anything?
GLORIA (referring to Sally)
What she said about “fuck it.”
ERHARD
But that’s not the empty and meaningless that you got in here. That’s the empty and meaning-
less you got in the seminar on the other side of the wall. The one you paid $625 for, you didn’t
get that one. You got the cheap one, you got the one that doesn’t cost anything. The $625 one
does not give you any prescriptions, it does not justify anything. See, you want to use it to justi-
fy something. Right?
GLORIA
Yeah.
ERHARD
You think it justifi es doing nothing, but that’s not the empty and meaningless we’re talking
about in here. The empty and meaningless we’re talking about in here justifi es nothing. And
what bothers you is it’s going to invalidate your whole life because you’re a “rice Christian.”
You didn’t work to work.

SPEAKING BEING
GLORIA
I don’t go to church.
ERHARD
Yeah, you’re a “rice Christian.” I don’t care whether you go to church or not, you’re a “rice
Christian.” You don’t work to work. You work in-order-to. That makes you a slave.
GLORIA
That’s human. We’re all human.
ERHARD
Horseshit, human. It’s crap. See, you just used the truth to justify something. You took all of the
truth out of it. Yes, it is quite human and it justifi es nothing, it explains nothing, and if it does
justify or explain something it is no longer the truth. It’s just some stupid justifi cation.
GLORIA
I can’t get any possibility out of it.
ERHARD
No, because you haven’t gotten it yet.
GLORIA
Okay.
ERHARD
You’ve got to go through that feeling bad, Gloria. You get to feeling bad and stop. You’ve got to
go all the way through the feeling bad. Did you get that? You’ve got to go all the way through
it. You still have got something there. You haven’t gotten to empty and meaningless yet. You’ve
gotten to “empty and meaningless and that’s bad.” That’s not all the way through it. Clear?
GLORIA
Yeah.
ERHARD
Good for you.
(applause)
Jake?
On the fi rst day of The Forum, Jake, an architect, was the participant who was “hustle waiting to
happen,” and who also had his “foot nailed to the fl oor” in regard to sincerity and inauthenticity.
