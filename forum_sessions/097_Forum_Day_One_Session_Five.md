Forum Day One: Session Five
83
PATRICIA
Three.
ERHARD
Good. We’re going to leave you at three.
(returning to her seat as the group applauded)
For how many people in the room is something starting to move?
(many hands raising)
For how many people in the room is nothing starting to move?
(more hands)
How many people are at maybe, can’t tell?
(still more hands)
You know where you should be? Where you are?
(pausing)
I’m going to give you an assignment which will determine how much you get
out of The Forum. I got your money. I can’t lose. You can lose. The point is:
you have a chance to enhance what you get out of here. Bring your life in here
tomorrow. Don’t bring the face you brought today—the “I’ve got it all togeth-
er” face. Bring in the face that’s authentic about your own inauthenticity.
What has it cost you in life to collapse those domains? What you’re bringing in
tomorrow is your inauthenticity.
(pausing)
We didn’t talk about looking good today, did we? We’re going to do it in
thirty seconds. You have a major concern for looking good. For some people
looking bad is looking good. So when you come in tomorrow, be able to
talk about where in your life are you used by looking good. Looking good
owns your life.
(pausing)
The four-day format of this Forum is both an asset and a liability. The
liability is that there aren’t five days between the weekends for you to be
back in your lives and talk about your experience. You have got to commu-
nicate what’s happening for you here. You have got to be articulate in this
conversation. Tonight you’ve got to talk about this to other people. You’ve
got to begin to be able to generate the conversation. You’ve got to be able to
speak this. You don’t have to explain it. You want to be in communication
about this like an experience, like a presence. I know a lot of people who
understand this and don’t live it.
PARTICIPANT
It is very late and I am tired.
PATRICIA
A four.
ERHARD
Do you know why you are tired? Notice I didn’t ask you “do you think you
k
know why?” I asked if you know why you’re tired.
PATRICIA
No.
ERHARD
What’s the relationship between the reasons you have for being tired and
being tired? There isn’t any. The reasons are valid. In other words, in the world
of reasons every reason you have is a valid reason. You don’t have any nutty
reasons.
(turning to the group and speaking in a loud voice)
There’s no such thing as tired! That’s a concept!
(back to Patricia)
Where in your body are you experiencing what you used to call being tired?
PATRICIA
My arms.
ERHARD
And where else in your body?
As Erhard repeated the question, she responded each time by identifying a tired
area of her body.
ERHARD
Nothing much conceptual about this, is there? It’s all presence.
PATRICIA
My arms are still tired.
ERHARD
For a while there you were really looking. But then you got to thinking
about it. Whenever you say “still” or “also”... See how easy it is to collapse
the domains?
(continuing to question her)
You were at a four when you started this. Where are you now?

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Do you think I give a shit that you’re tired? We’re talking about the rest of your
life and you’re sitting there complaining about being tired. That’s disgusting.
You are disgusting.
(pausing: to the group)
Now that I’ve got your attention. . .
(repeating the assignments)
Let me leave you with a reminder. I have already gotten everything I need out
of this Forum. You have not. You need to be twice as powerful tomorrow. The
way to be twice as powerful is to do these assignments. You gave your word
to be here on time tomorrow. Is that clear? You gave your word to be on time
tomorrow regardless of the circumstances, is that clear?
(to a participant who was standing at the back of the room preparing to leave)
What are you doing at the door with your hat and coat on? You need to be
back in The Forum so we can end The Forum.
The participant returned to her seat in palpable silence.
ERHARD
Thank you.
The fi rst day of The Forum ended.

SPEAKING BEING
the circumstances. There are also moments when we experience freedom from
self-awareness. The diff erence between these two states is relevant to our inquiry
here. Where does the self live when it is not alive in our awareness?
This leads to the second point made here by Heidegger, one which is generally less
apparent than the first: self-reflection is at the same time self-production: “The essential
thing is ‘I will myself’” (EP 64). The human self is not like the human elbow: it is not a
P
ready-made part of the package that accompanies an infant’s arrival in the world. What
is included in the package, although not immediately functional, is language, which pro-
vides the material with which we are eventually able to produce a self. But in a world of
beings with selves, questions about the nature and stability of the self arise persistently,
and recent advances in the study of the human brain, as well as child development, have
informed the inquiry but have not answered the questions. Therefore we note the point
here as a question to be kept open as The Forum proceeds.
Regarding the phenomenon of reflexion, Heidegger says further that it is “Man’s
settling down in one of his essential places,” and he notes with emphasis that it is
characterized by “certainty, certainty” (EP 60). That is, for the most part, human
P
beings are made both secure and comfortable by the condition that their self-knowl-
edge provides. While many of us spend considerable time tinkering with the details
of our identities in the interest of self-improvement, on the whole those identities
give us security. On the whole, we are at home in ourselves.
This, at least, is the way of things in the current paradigm. This interpretation
of the self, however, while self-evident to most of us, is an artifact of a particular way
t
of understanding human being. Indeed, it has been the dominant understanding for
several centuries; and while it is increasingly questioned among people who think
actively about these matters, such as philosophers and other scholars, it remains
the operative understanding for most people in the world—not as something they
bring to mind, or could articulate, but as a way of functioning in their everyday lives.
This particular way of understanding the world, and our place in it, is generally
known as the Cartesian paradigm. It is so called in recognition of the man in whose
thinking the model was crystallized, the seventeenth-century French philosopher
and mathematician Rene Descartes. As a philosopher, Descartes’ job was to engage
in thought experiments; and in one of those experiments—which turned out to be
significant for all of us—he decided that he would place everything in the world in
doubt. His purpose in doing this was to discover what, if anything, was indubitable:
what in the world, in the face of committed skepticism, could retain a quality of
absolute certainty?
