SPEAKING BEING
you right. That’s the only thing that’s worth anything. Something that makes you right; that’s 
worth something. Something that makes somebody or something else wrong; that’s worth 
something. Something with which you can dominate; that’s worth something. Something with 
which you can avoid domination; that’s worth something. Something you can justify yourself 
with or invalidate others; that’s worth something.
(loudly)
The truth isn’t worth anything. It’s worthless because you can’t use it. And the instant you try to 
draw a conclusion from it, you make a “therefore”; you put a “therefore” behind the truth and 
it sucks all the truth out of it. It’s no longer true; it is now more bullshit. You stumble across the 
truth, you happen to bump into it, leave it alone. By leave it alone I don’t mean walk away from 
it, or ignore it, I mean: let it be. Is that clear? You want to take that page out of Jacob’s book, 
and it will move things forward here more rapidly. And we won’t still be here Monday morn-
ing. 
(Jacob sits as Erhard addresses another standing participant)
You did not get that it’s empty and meaningless?
DENNIS
I want to believe that I’m getting it, but I’m not getting it. 
ERHARD
What is it that you’re not getting?
DENNIS
That life is empty and meaningless.
ERHARD
Okay. What is the meaning of life? 
DENNIS
I don’t know. That’s what I’m here for. 
WES
I’m now going to tell you. You want to know the meaning of life? Let me tell you the meaning 
of life, and then you’ll know the meaning of life and you’ll see the diff erence it makes in your 
life. 
Wes got a dictionary from the table and read from it the defi nition of “life”: “The property or quality 
that distinguishes living organisms from dead organisms...etc.”
ERHARD (continuing)
