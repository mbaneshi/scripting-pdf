Forum Day One: Session One
31
After Erhard left the room, Julie requested that due to the size of the group all participants should
be respectful of the hotel. She pointed out the assistants who could direct participants to pay phones
and bathrooms. “We request that you don’t eat on this break,” she said. “If you must eat for medical
reasons, please see Wes,” one of the two Forum leaders who were assisting Erhard. Finally she in-
troduced the other four Forum supervisors who were working with her, and who were available to
answer their questions. Finally, as she would before every break, she read the names of participants
who had received telephone messages during the session.
The Forum adjourned for a break at 12:40 pm.

SPEAKING BEING
Hints: Ontological Distinctions
The Forum achieves its result through the development in dialogue of what Werner
Erhard calls distinctions. In traditional education, based in an epistemological model
in which the goal is to increase or enhance what is known, information—concepts,
ideas, processes—are communicated through definition and explanation. The Fo-
rum, however, develops an ontological model of education, in which the goal is not
an increase in knowledge but an experience of Being. In this model, the elements of
the course content are distinguished.
The nature of distinctions will be addressed at length by Erhard later in The
Forum. But here, early on the first morning, the development of distinctions is al-
ready under way. Erhard is beginning to employ an aspect of his methodology that,
according to Martin Heidegger, is central to ontological communication: the use of
hints to communicate what cannot directly be spoken, thereby providing access to
the content as lived rather than as merely understood.
Heidegger introduced the idea of hinting as a way of communicating Being in
his 1959 essay, “A Dialogue on Language” (in OWL), which provides an account of
his conversation with a Japanese scholar who shared his interest in ontological
inquiry. The interaction, presented in the form of a transcript, occurs as a stately
conversational dance, a linguistic minuet. Each move is made with great care, so the
interaction proceeds at times with excruciating deliberateness. At one point Heide-
gger (referred to in the account as the Inquirer) poses a question—“Do you have in
your language a word for what we call language?”—to which the scholar arrives at
a tentative answer only after twenty-three pages of thoughtful circumnavigation in
and around the topic.
In response to a remark by the Japanese about language’s “essential being,”
Heidegger refers to his often-quoted characterization of language as “the house of
Being.” The phrase, he says, “gives a hint of the nature of language” (“DL” in OWL
26). As the two men’s dialogue continues, the extraordinary attentiveness given
to each word reveals a respect for the nature of hints. Hints, Heidegger observes,
“belong to an entirely different realm of reality. . . . They are enigmatic. They beckon
to us. They beckon away. They beckon us toward that from which they unexpectedly
bear themselves toward us” (“DL” in OWL 26).
In his conversation with the Japanese scholar, Heidegger is distinguishing
hinting, which is to say that he is hinting at the nature of hints. The Forum’s develop-
ment of distinctions is likewise a process of hinting.
SESSION ONE INTERVAL
In hinting, words are spoken in such a way that “each word in each case is
given its full—most often hidden—weight” (“DL” in OWL 31). What is not spoken, but
communicated in the background, is allowed to reverberate. In this way a space is
allowed to develop around each utterance:
[Inquirer]: Hints need the widest sphere in which to swing. . .
[Japanese]: . . . where mortals go to and fro only slowly.
[Inquirer]: This is what our language calls “hesitate.” It is done
truly when slowness rests on shy reverence. And so I do not wish to
disturb your hesitation by urging you on too rashly.
[Japanese]: You are more helpful to me in my attempt to say the
word than you can know. (“DL” in OWL 27–28)
Further, although each distinction has a rubric for its topic—in this dialogue, the
topic is the nature of language—in developing distinctions the aim is not to arrive at
a correct verbal articulation of the rubric. On the contrary, the goal is to avoid such a
resolution:
[Japanese]: We Japanese do not think it strange if a dialogue
leaves undefined what is really intended, or even restores it
back to the keeping of the undefinable.
[Inquirer]: That is part, I believe, of every dialogue that
has turned out well between thinking beings. As if of its own
accord, it can take care that that undefinable something not
only does not slip away, but displays its gathering force ever
more luminously in the course of the dialogue. (“DL” in OWL 13)
In this conversation, Heidegger and the Japanese scholar may be seen as
enacting the methodology of The Forum: the dialogic development of distinctions
through a process of hinting. Being cannot be verbalized. Being is in language, but
it is not in the words that are spoken. It lives in the unspoken background, and in
a conversation for Being, that background must be made present. Hints are an
appropriate form for bringing a background to presence because they direct our
attention toward something we had not noticed, something which they at the same
time bring forward to meet us.
Ontological hinting is not an easy form of communication to master, and by
characterizing it here as an element of The Forum’s “methodology,” we have fallen
prey to one of its pitfalls. When Heidegger says to the Japanese scholar that calling
