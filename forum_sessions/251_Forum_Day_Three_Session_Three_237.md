Forum Day Three: Session Three 237
JACOB
No, no, no, I’m attracted to... I like the idea...
KIPP
So what if you like the idea? Why do you like it?
JACOB
Because it’s light-hearted. Taking the drama out of it...
KIPP
It’s like morning TV instead of afternoon TV. Doesn’t matter.
JACOB
Yeah, I know, what I’m saying is because I like your philosophy, I’m going to have to try to
make it meaningful...
KIPP
I don’t have a philosophy.
JACOB
Then what were you talking about?
KIPP
What I was saying. You think this is a philosophy. No philosophy here. Or if it is, it’s not The
Forum. See, this is fi reside chats with Jacob. This is your little place where you hang out. This
is your meaning you’re holding onto with your fi ngernails and your toes and everything else.
It’s all in a nice neat box, the same as Angel. And for everyone else here in the room, what you
should get is that this is what yours sounds like too, just your version of it.
ERHARD
This is not a philosophy. This is not a view of life. This is not one of the many views. This
is not another religion. That’s not what this is. It doesn’t replace or negate anything. It’s
more like dog shit than it is like philosophy—something to step in. If you treat it like
philosophy, you’ll fuck it up. If you’re going to treat it like something, treat it like dog shit.
Step in it.
KIPP
As you were saying, Jacob...
JACOB
I was just thinking that I should sit down because as long as I’m standing I’m going to want an
answer to all this.
The Same
In suggesting that the experiences evoked in The Forum and in
the est Training are at some level the same, we are venturing into
important and precarious Heideggerian territory. Werner Erhard
suggested the nature of this territory in a 1983 interview, when
challenged to compare the est Training with other enlightenment
systems, such as Zen:
I think that discussions about enlightenment
are useless, and I think making enlightenment
sacred is even more futile. My question is, what’s
this conversation all about? . . . We’re not really
talking about anything. I don’t know how else to
respond to you. You can’t ask, “Is this enlighten-
ment like that enlightenment?” That’s counting
enlightenments. That’s nuts! (Network Review,
1:4, September 1983, emphasis added)

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
Then when you sit down you’ll do whatever you do when you sit down. And that’s all there is.
JACOB
What’s the motivation then?
KIPP
Whatever it is. You are the kind of being that thinks there has to be a motivation. There is
no motivation, because there’s no place to get to. People who are addicted to motivation are
addicted to trying to get somewhere. Can you see that that’s the source of motivation? But there
is no place to get to. You know why?
JACOB
Why?
KIPP
There’s no place to get to because it’s already turned out. This is the way it turned out. How do
you like it?
JACOB
No.
KIPP
It doesn’t matter. You turned out this way, right?
JACOB
Yeah, but, it’s imperfect. I can live with it, but...
KIPP
What’s imperfect?
JACOB
The world’s imperfect.
KIPP
Where?
JACOB
Ethiopia.
KIPP
Ethiopia is Ethiopia.
One cannot compare enlightenment experiences, because one
cannot compare nothing with nothing, since there is only one
nothing. Or, as an alternative interpretation, there is no nothing;
nothing is a nullity, its existence is self-nullified. There is nothing to
be compared. And yet, I can say these sentences, so nothing can be
talked about.
In Heidegger’s words, “‘there is given’ [es gibt] the Nothing.”
He adds: “but we cannot, at present, determine more closely who
or what gives the Nothing” (BC 45). That question must remain
open to call forth thinking. So Heidegger moves on to another
possible interpretation of the situation: “We can also say that the
Nothing presences [west], in order to indicate that the Nothing is
not merely the absence and lack of beings” (BC 45).
The Nothing does not first need beings and a
being in order to presence, as if it would pres-
ence only if beings were eliminated in advance.
The Nothing is not the result of such an elimina-
tion. There is given the Nothing in spite of the
fact that beings are. (BC 45)
“
We referred to this territory as precarious, not because the topic
is subversive, but because the conversation can easily begin to
sound silly. Sophomoric. Heidegger is not surprised that we may
be thinking this:
Here we easily fall into the danger of playing
with words. People make use of the justifiable
indication of this danger in order to banish all
thought “about” the Nothing as fatal. But the
danger is no less that, because we seem to be
merely playing around with words, we take the
Nothing too lightly and fail to recognize that
there is given the Nothing. (BC 45–46)
