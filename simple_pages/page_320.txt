SPEAKING BEING
LUCY
Well, I disagree. I really do. Because I think everything is a state of mind. 
ERHARD
Oh absolutely. You go out and tell the bus that. Lucy, you’ve been in too many success seminars. 
Everything is not a state of mind. Buses are not a state of mind. I don’t care what anybody has 
told you. And the evidence is all on my side. 
(responding to a participant not on camera)
Excuse me?
(repeating thoughtfully what the participant said)
A new suit of clothes for the king. Yes. My tongue’s way more tied than yours is; you can’t out 
tongue tie me. Yeah, I understand what you said. I was just trying to get it. Yeah, what about it?
(repeating what the participant said—who does not have a microphone)
Is that all in the mind?
(addressing himself out loud)
Let’s see, am I going to give him the truth or just shut him up?
(laughter)
It’s all in the mind.
(laughter. Then seriously)
To stop being a smart-ass about this, I will respond to you. Yes, it is what you and I ordinarily 
call “in the mind,” but if we look a little closer, it is not in the mind, it was in the mouth. A suit 
of clothes is a conversation, not a mental image. But that is a fi ne point and your point is valid. 
Buses are not a suit of clothes, right? It’s not all in the mind.  A lot of people think buses are in 
the mind. And they look like they’ve been hit by buses.
(to Lucy)
You all done?
LUCY
Yes, I’m done.
ERHARD
Okay great!
(applause as Lucy sits )
