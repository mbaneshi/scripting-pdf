SPEAKING BEING
There’s no such thing as action, there’s only action-in-the-world; “world” as an occurring and 
“action” are correlates of one another. That ball looked uncatchable to you. That’s how the ball 
looks to somebody called “clumsy.” It looks uncatchable, and their actions are those of anybody 
else, athletic or not, their actions are the same, because the actions are not a product of a 
property inside one’s self called “athletic.” People’s actions are a correlate of the way the world 
occurs for them. Anybody didn’t get that?
JERRY
I didn’t get it.
ERHARD
What didn’t you get? Did you get that we are talking about the source of action?
JERRY
I heard it.
ERHARD
There’s a diff erence between hearing and getting. Did you get that we’re talking about the 
source of action? Is that clear to you?
JERRY
Yes.
ERHARD
So what didn’t you get? “I didn’t get...”
JERRY
I didn’t get that it’s the same thing when you throw the ball over there to him as when you 
throw it to her and she doesn’t catch it. 
ERHARD
That’s good. That’s clear. Now we can have a forwarding discussion. So, his actions down here 
are correlated to an uncatchable ball, yes?
JERRY
Correlated to me means “goes along with.”
ERHARD
That’s close enough for the moment, yes. His actions are consistent with—go along 
with—an uncatchable ball, yes?
JERRY
Yes.
ERHARD (continuing)
