Forum Day Four: Session Two

WES
That tells them the occurrence. That gives them the occurrence.
PAUL
Them?
WES
Whatever problems you’ve got.
PAUL
I don’t know.
WES
That’s a good place to be right now. We’ll call on someone else.
NICOLE
Through defi nition...
WES
No, no, no, this is all too descriptive. There is a statement...
NICOLE
This is a problem.
WES
Okay. That’s not how problems occur. You got a problem? Give me a problem: a good one.
NICOLE
My thesis.
WES
Is a problem? There’s no movement on it?
NICOLE
Correct.
WES
You’re dealing with all the “hunnahunnahunna.” “What am I gonna do?”
NICOLE
Right. Nine years.
396
SPEAKING BEING
WES
Nine years, yes.
(laughter)r
So Nicole. “My thesis not getting done” does not occur like: “It’s a problem, my thesis isn’t
getting done.” Right?
NICOLE
Right.
WES
Yeah. It occurs some way. How does it occur?
NICOLE
Through being stuck.
WES
No, you just explained it. Not bad. But explained it. I want the occurrence. What’s your relation-
ship to the thesis not getting done? Talk to me about it. Tell me... what goes on with you about
it?
NICOLE
Oh I use a lot of reasons.
WES
Right. You’ve got reasons. And lying. What else?
NICOLE
And disbelief.
WES
And why is that going on with you? Why do you have to give all those reasons for it and lies
about it and disbeliefs about it?
NICOLE
So it won’t get done.
WES
No.
NICOLE
Ask the question again?
Forum Day Four: Session Two
397
WES
Yeah. You give reasons for not doing it.
NICOLE
Yes.
WES
And lies about it. Right?
(Nicole nods)
And there’s other things that you’re not doing that you don’t feel the need to give reasons for
and lies about.
NICOLE
Yes.
WES
How come you feel the need to do it in this thing, which is a problem and not in the other thing?
NICOLE
Because it has to get done.
WES
Close. Close. “It has to get done” has got some quality in it. It’s like that. Now, see, there’s some
things that have to get done and they’re getting done. This other thing has to get done, and it’s
not getting done. And what’s your relationship to that?
NICOLE
I make myself wrong.
WES
Yeah. Now it’s closer. Someone or something is being made wrong. You see that?
NICOLE
Yeah.
WES
That’s at the source of a problem. The box that problems come in is called shouldn’t be.
(writing “shouldn’t be” above the square on the chalkboard)
“I’m not getting my thesis done”: that shouldn’t be. “There’s something wrong here.” “I should be thin;
I keep eating. That shouldn’t be.” It’s not like, “hey, I’m fat, dig it.” It’s not like “Hey stupid-ass thesis.
Primordial Metaphor: Clearing
Earth—the planet—existed prior to the emergence of human be-
ings. The world as clearing did not “exist,” however, since “world”
d
is a meaningful phenomenon, and meaning emerged on the planet
concurrently with human beings.
One interesting view of the way the world came into being
was proposed by the eighteenth-century Italian philosopher
398
SPEAKING BEING
I’ll just keep lying to people so that they keep giving me grant money. I don’t care.” But no, that’s not
your relationship to your thesis, but it could be. You wouldn’t have a problem: You’d have a scam.
(laughter)r
What turns it into a problem is “it shouldn’t be.” “I should be doing this thing and I’m not
getting it done.” “Not getting it done” shouldn’t be. The box that problems occur in is “shouldn’t
be.” It’s kind of obvious, right?
NICOLE
Yeah.
WES
You’re waiting for the heavens to part. They’re not going to part; you just may get a powerful
and profound insight that may let you get your damn thesis done.
NICOLE
True.
WES
Can you see that the occurrence “not getting thesis done” occurs “shouldn’t be”? That whole
thing?
NICOLE
Yeah.
WES
Great. And where does “shouldn’t be” occur? Does “shouldn’t be” occur in the thesis?
NICOLE
No.
WES
Does “shouldn’t be” occur in the ceiling?
NICOLE
No.
WES
No. “Shouldn’t be” occurs where?
(Nicole points to her mouth)
Very good Nicole. Thanks.
Giambattista Vico. Like Martin Heidegger, Vico perceived a lost power
in the thinking of the ancients. His interest in the thinking of the
“first men,” those who shaped the early use of language, anticipated
Heidegger’s persistent attempt to reconstruct the understanding of
the pre-Socratic Greek thinkers. Like Heidegger, Vico understood that
he was entering shadowy territory: it is beyond our power, he said,
“to enter into the vast imagination of those first men, whose minds
were not in the least abstract, refined, or spiritualized, because they
were entirely immersed in the senses, buff eted by the passions,
buried in the body” (The New Science 118).
But his exploration of this realm led him to develop a theory
of primordial metaphor that resonates with Heidegger’s distinc-
r
tion of originary naming. Metaphor, for Vico, was based in identity
rather than similarity (James M. Edie, Speaking and Meaning: The
Phenomenology of Language 166). It was a theory of first thought;
according to the scholar Donald Phillip Verene, Vico proposed that
the mind’s cardinal act was “a transference or bearing of meaning
from sensation as placeless, momentary flux to the fixation of sen-
sation as a god.” Thus, through metaphor, the beings were brought
into Being. Says Verene: “Metaphor can be understood as likeness
or similarity only if we ignore its role in relation to the is. To regard
the constructive power of metaphor as based on its analogical
capacity is also to presuppose its primordial power to construct
the is” (Vico’s Science of Imagination 174).
There was, then, a moment at the dawn of time when hu-
mans brought forth beings through the creation of metaphors. On
this view, whether we recognize it or not, we are already always
thinking and speaking from within the metaphors that have
been constructed and then passed down in our tradition, meta-
phors that generate assumptions about what is possible in being
human. The philosopher Richard Rorty has proposed that what
we should be doing as thinking beings is using up the metaphors
that we have inherited, and creating new ones. Not to do so, says
Rorty, is to worship the dead metaphors of our ancestors (Contin-
gency, Irony, and Solidarity 20). The work of Martin Heidegger and
Werner Erhard may be seen as the creation of new metaphors.
An important Heideggerian metaphor that Erhard has adapted
for use in his own work is the term clearing. “Clearing” is a metaphor

(applause)
“Shouldn’t be” is the box that problems come in for human beings. The already always existing
box you’re given when you’re born—you’re born and they slap you on the ass and they hand you
a box “this shouldn’t be.” Yeah, that’s the party. Someone’s good idea. I don’t know. And now
you’ve got this box and you put some of your junk in it, and the question is, “how come you love
that box?” Yeah, you were given the box, but you really love it. Like you have some fascination
and addiction to “shouldn’t be.” Do you have any sense that it may relate to your racket?
(laughter)r
Think about it. Rackets love problems and problems love rackets. They’re natural. They’re a fi t.
They’re a couple. Rackets and problems fi t together: a marriage made in heaven. Do you think
a racket would be any good without some juicy problems in which to make somebody wrong?
You think a racket would stay around without any problems? She has a racket with her thesis.
Her racket loves the thesis. You’re fat and you want to lose weight and you don’t have a racket
about it, you lose weight. Or you say “the hell with it” and just accept being overweight. There’s
no problem having no money, unless it “shouldn’t be.” Some people give away all their money
so that they can be free. They make money “shouldn’t be.” Your problems are a function of
“shouldn’t be,” and you get to say what “shouldn’t be.” The availability “shouldn’t be” comes
with languaging, but the specifi c use of it: That’s you. It nails your foot to the fl oor, and then
you don’t have to be responsible for going anywhere, so that’s kind of good.
(walking in a circle as if his foot is “nailed to the fl oor”)”
“Oh God! My car won’t start. I can’t get to work. I’ll never get promoted. I’m a failure. My moth-
er was right. She’s always right, the bitch. I was right to make her wrong. She didn’t lend me
the money for the car I really need. Don’t you understand?” People love their problems. When
people get attached to their problems they carry them around forever, like this:
(Wes holds onto one of the director’s chairs and drags it as he walks slowly across the stage)
They bring them to parties. “How’s it going?”
(laughter)r
People never know what to talk about when they’re confronted by being, so they talk about
their problems. “Hey, did I tell you about my problem?”
(laughter)r
Some people become PhDs in their problem. “Oh, I’ve fi nally understood it.” Some people fi nd a
therapist they pay to listen. Therapists love people who love their problems. Then they analyze it.
(examining an imaginary object)
“Well, this particular one I’ve got is gray.”
for human being, a constitutive designation for the Being-in-the-world
of Dasein. Such metaphors, introduced into a tradition, shape the way
we understand ourselves and our world. In the Cartesian model that
has dominated our Western tradition for several centuries, Dasein is
the self-certain thinking subject—the cogito of “Cogito, ergo sum”—and
the opening for the world (and for Being) is as an “object,” or cogi-
tatum. If Dasein is that specific development of subjective self-con-
sciousness referred to as an identity, the opening for Being is whatever
y
is allowed by that particular identity’s value and truth structure.
In these perspectives, what is determinative is that Dasein
itself—as cogito, or subject, or identity—“‘gets into the picture’ in
precedence over whatever is.” Whatever is, is forced “back into
this relationship to oneself as the normative realm” (“AWP” in QCT
129). The world becomes my “picture” of it, and Being is cut to fit
that picture. The world, in other words, is all about me.
In contrast to these perspectives, Heidegger proposes the
metaphor clearing, a metaphor which, as Michael E. Zimmerman
points out, has been implicit in the Cartesian model all along:
“Modern philosophy posits a gap between subject and object
because it has failed to notice that a temporal clearing (transcen-
dence) is needed for subject and object to present themselves in
the first place” (Eclipse of the Self 25, emphasis added). In Heide-
gger’s model, absent the normative self-referring subject, there is
simply the clearing itself, and the lighting of whatever is:
In the midst of beings as a whole an open
place occurs. There is a clearing, a lighting.
Thought of in reference to what is, to beings,
this clearing is in a greater degree than are
beings. This open center is therefore not
surrounded by what is; rather, the lighting
center itself encircles all that is, like the
Nothing which we scarcely know. That which
is can only be, as a being, if it stands within
and stands out within what is lighted in this
clearing. [. . .] The nature of truth is, in itself,
the primal conflict in which that open center is
won. . . . (“OWA” in PLT 53, 55)
“

SPEAKING BEING
And they never get that this “understanding it,” and “analyzing it,” and this “studying it,” has only
one problem to it: They’ve still got “it.” So, how to let the problem go? Have it disappear? How to
let the problem disappear? That’s where the discussion is headed. Wake up! We’re coming to a good
part. I promise. Well, if problems occur in languaging, and the specifi c languaging that problems
occur in is “shouldn’t be,” how about trying out a new languaging? How about creating? You know
this is already given, so you’ll have to confront it ongoingly. Your racket will continue on after The
Forum, I promise. And its love for problems will continue on after The Forum, I promise. And your
fascination with problems stuck to your racket will continue on after The Forum, I promise. But
here’s the possibility in what I am saying. You can confront it: In the presence of it, you can take
your problem, and transform it by confronting the box it already comes in, and allowing a new
box—putting it into a new box—intentionally putting it into a new box. So I’m going to give you a
name of a new box you could put your problem in. This is not the truth. Problems “shouldn’t be”?
Here’s the question you have to confront: Who made you the judge? God’s happy, what’s your prob-
lem? Who made you the judge, the ultimate decider of what shouldn’t be in life? Not a lot of power
in that. So try this one on. Put a new conversation around the actual problems that you’ve got, like a
possibility. And the conversation I’m inviting you to put around them is: In life there are problems.
Wes erased “shouldn’t be” and wrote “in life there are problems” over the top of the box with the word
“problems” inside it.
WES (continuing)
Simple enough. In life there are problems. Not: Life’s about no problems. When problems
shouldn’t be, the conclusion is that a great life is a life without problems. That’s nonsense! A life
without problems is a lousy life. It’s a stinky life. You want a life without problems? We have a
little operation we can perform on you; you would have to do it in Mexico, though. We’ll remove
all your internal organs and suspend you in tepid water. That’s a life without problems. Power-
ful people are judged by their problems. The problem with you is, your problems are small and
crappy—and the same ones over and over. You’re boring. She’s been dealing with this crummy
thesis for nine years. Imagine listening to her for nine years about it?
(laughter)r
She should get some big problems and she’ll fi nish the darn thing. And then take on a job that’s
a real problem for her, and do great with that until she takes on more responsibility, runs a uni-
versity and has a lot of problems. Then you’d be interesting to talk to. That’s the problem. You’re
resisting the very thing that gives life its whole excitement—problems—because they “shouldn’t
be.” So the way to transform that is to confront each of your problems and the whole distinction
“problem” and put them in a box called “in life there are problems.” Okay. Any questions? Any
“yeah but”s and “how about”s?
DONALD
So I take a problem, in my case, say, my weight. And in life there are problems. I’ve got a prob-
lem that I’m sixty pounds more than I want to be, or sixty pounds more than healthy.
As we have shown elsewhere, this is the clearing that Heidegger
saw manifested in the thinking of the pre-Socratics, the site of the
primal struggle by which they brought Being to stand, thereby
brought forth the world, and won the clearing for the emergence
of truth. A human being is a clearing in the world for things to be
the things they are.
For both Heidegger and Erhard, this is a central point: gener-
ative thinking, thinking that wants to unconceal the truth of Being
and thereby light beings, can do so only if there is first created a
clearing for the lighting: “Light can stream into the clearing,” says
Heidegger; but light itself never creates the clearing. “Rather, light
presupposes it” (“EP&TT” in BW 442). According to the scholar
W
William Lovitt, Heidegger has expressed a preference that the da
in Da-sein, be translated as openness, rather than the traditional
there (Intro to QCT, xxxv). A human being is fundamentally
T
Being-openness.
“The lumen naturale,” says Heidegger, “the light of reason,
throws light only on the open” (“EP&TT” in BW 443). But it is im-
W
portant to note that while Dasein is the clearing for the light, Dasein
is the light, as well. In Being and Time, Heidegger pointed out that
the figurative expression, lumen naturale, denotes the existen-
tial-ontological structure of Dasein itself. The light is a constituent
of Dasein, and begins to shine when Dasein “is in such a way as to
be its ‘there’” (BT 171). In becoming the opening of the clearing, we
T
become simultaneously the light which illuminates the clearing.
The dialogue of The Forum may be seen as a process for clear-
ing the opening that The Forum participants are, thereby enabling
them to know themselves as a “there” for the lighting of Being.
The first step in the process is the deconstruction of participants’
normative subjectivities, the primal struggle that responds to the
first question of The Forum: What is the Being of human beings?
This clears the opening for the second question: What is the possi-
bility of Being for human beings? It is through this second question
that the clearing is lighted. ■
WES (continuing; laughter)
Forum Day Four: Session Two
401
WES
But there’s no problem yet. See “I’m sixty pounds more that I want to be” is not a problem.
That’s “sixty pounds more than I want to be.”
DONALD
That’s right. I spoke that. I languaged that. So if I wanted to weigh 235 pounds, and I weighed
235 pounds, I’d be happy, because that’s how much I wanted to weigh.
WES
No. I don’t know that you’d be happy.
DONALD
Because I said so.
WES
No. That’s just how much you would weigh.
DONALD
There wouldn’t be a problem there.
WES
Not yet. If you weighed what you weighed, there’s no problem.
DONALD
It’s a problem...
WES
If you weigh what you weigh and you shouldn’t weigh that, then there’s a problem. Or you’re
on a diet and it’s not working fast enough and that shouldn’t be. Or you try and it doesn’t work
and it should have worked.
DONALD
But if I wanted to weigh 235 pounds and I weigh 235 pounds...
WES
The fi rst step is to say to your problem called “your weight” that “in life there are problems,” not
“the problem about my weight shouldn’t be. I shouldn’t have a problem with my weight.”
DONALD
That’s what I’m saying: “I shouldn’t have a problem about my weight.”
402
SPEAKING BEING
WES
No it’s more like “I shouldn’t have the problem ‘weight.’”
DONALD
I shouldn’t have the problem “weight,” I should be more like Ron.
(indicating person sitting next to him who looks more fi t than Donald)
WES
No.
(laughter)r
That you have problems, is wrong. You’d be better off  without your problems, right Donald?
DONALD
Yeah.
WES
That’s what we’re dealing with.
DONALD
Oh, I’ve got it.
WES
You wouldn’t be better off  without your problems, because if have life, you’ll have problems.
DONALD
I got it.
WES
The whole group “problems” has opened up. We haven’t dealt with the specifi c problem called
weight.
DONALD
I got it.
WES
You can stand with your problems like “acceptance,” or even more than acceptance.
DONALD
Recognition.
Forum Day Four: Session Two
403
WES
Recognition that that is part of the deal.
DONALD
Right and that’s part of the deal of being human, not part of my deal, not part of Ron’s deal. The
gorilla doesn’t have the problem “weight.” The gorilla is just the gorilla. Because we’re human
and we show up in this culture of human, and we’ve got languaging then we’ve got a weight
problem.
WES
No, we’ve got problems that shouldn’t be problems.
DONALD
We’ve got problems that shouldn’t be problems. Yeah. To me, when you put up there that in
life there are problems, that seemed very fl ippant. Like “Huh, in life there are problems.” Like
there’s no weight to them, there’s no...
WES
No, you should have the problems that you have. Sorry. The problems that you have are appro-
priate. And they are part of your being alive.
DONALD
Not just my being alive.
WES
Right, being alive. So there’s an appropriateness to problems. There’s not a “shouldn’t be” to
problems. It’s part of living.
DONALD
Oh, in life there are problems.
WES
Exactly. Yeah. So you have started to shift your relationship to problems.
DONALD
So it’s not a problem that I have a problem. It’s in life that I have a problem.
WES
Yeah. It’s not a problem that you have a problem.
DONALD
Right. Like everybody else doesn’t.

نیکول بسیار خوب ممنون Giambattista Vico. مانند مارتین هایدگر ، ویکو قدرت از دست رفته را درک کرد
در تفکر پیشینیان. علاقه او به فکر کردن
"مردان اول" ، کسانی که استفاده زودهنگام از زبان را شکل داده اند ، پیش بینی می کردند
تلاش مداوم هایدگر برای بازسازی درک درک
متفکران یونانی قبل از سوکراتیک. مانند هایدگر ، ویکو این را فهمید
او گفت: او در حال ورود به قلمرو سایه دار بود: این فراتر از قدرت ماست.
"برای ورود به تصور گسترده آن مردان اول ، که ذهن آنها
در کمترین انتزاعی ، تصفیه شده یا معنوی نبودند ، زیرا آنها
کاملاً در حواس غوطه ور بودند ، که در اثر احساسات قرار می گرفتند ،
در بدن دفن شده است "(علوم جدید 118).
از استعاره اولیه که با Distinc- هایدگر طنین انداز است
حرف
نامگذاری اولیه. استعاره ، برای ویکو ، در هویت مستقر بود
به جای شباهت (جیمز م. ادی ، صحبت کردن و معنی:
پدیدارشناسی زبان 166). این یک تئوری فکر اول بود ؛
به گفته دانشمند دونالد فیلیپ وین ، ویکو این پیشنهاد را پیشنهاد کرد
عمل کاردینال ذهن "انتقال یا تحمل معنی بود
از احساس به عنوان شار بی پروا ، لحظه ای تا تثبیت سن-
به عنوان یک خدا. " بنابراین ، از طریق استعاره ، موجودات آورده شدند
به وجود Verene می گوید: "استعاره را می توان به عنوان شباهت درک کرد
یا شباهت فقط در صورتی که نقش آن را در رابطه با IS نادیده بگیریم. در نظر گرفتن
قدرت سازنده استعاره بر اساس قیاس آن
ظرفیت همچنین برای پیش فرض قدرت ابتدایی آن برای ساخت است
IS "(علم تخیل ویکو 174)
مانس موجودات را از طریق ایجاد استعاره ها به وجود آورد. در
این دیدگاه ، خواه آن را بشناسیم یا نه ، ما همیشه همیشه هستیم
فکر کردن و صحبت از درون استعاره هایی که دارند
ساخته شده و سپس در سنت ما گذشت ،
Phors که فرضیه هایی را در مورد آنچه در بودن ممکن است ایجاد می کنند
انسان فیلسوف ریچارد رورتی پیشنهاد کرده است که چه چیزی
ما باید این کار را انجام دهیم که فکر کردن موجودات از استعاره ها استفاده می کنند
که ما به ارث برده ایم و موارد جدیدی را ایجاد کرده ایم. نه انجام این کار ، می گوید
رورتی ، پرستش استعاره های مرده اجداد ما است (ادامه-
GENCY ، طنز و همبستگی 20). کار مارتین هایدگر و
ورنر ارهارد ممکن است به عنوان ایجاد استعاره های جدید دیده شود. استعاره مهم هایدگریایی که Erhard اقتباس کرده است
برای استفاده در کار خودش اصطلاح پاکسازی است. "پاکسازی" استعاره است

شما این جعبه را دارید و برخی از آشغال های خود را در آن قرار داده اید ، و سؤال این است: "چگونه شما عشق می کنید
آن جعبه؟ " بله ، به شما جعبه داده شد ، اما شما واقعاً آن را دوست دارید.
و اعتیاد به "نباید باشد". آیا این حس را دارید که ممکن است به راکت شما مربوط شود؟ (خنده) r
به آن فکر کنید راکت ها عاشق مشکلات و مشکلات عاشق راکت ها هستند. آنها طبیعی هستند آنها یک fi t هستند. آنها یک زن و شوهر هستند راکت ها و مشکلات در کنار هم: ازدواج در بهشت. فکر می کنی
یک راکت بدون برخی از مشکلات آبدار خوب خواهد بود که در آن کسی اشتباه کند؟ شما فکر می کنید یک راکت بدون هیچ مشکلی در اطراف خواهد ماند؟ او با پایان نامه خود راکت دارد. راکت او عاشق پایان نامه است. شما چاق هستید و می خواهید وزن کم کنید و راکت ندارید
در مورد آن ، شما وزن کم می کنید. یا شما می گویید "جهنم با آن" و فقط اضافه وزن را می پذیرید. وجود دارد
مشکلی ندارید که پول نداشته باشید ، مگر اینکه "نباید باشد". بعضی از افراد تمام پول خود را می دهند
تا بتوانند آزاد باشند. آنها پول می گیرند "نباید باشد." مشکلات شما تابعی است
"نباید باشد" ، و شما باید بگویید که "نباید باشد". در دسترس بودن "نباید باشد" می آید
با زبان ، اما استفاده از آن از آن: این شما هستید. پای شما را به سمت فلت می کشد ، و سپس
لازم نیست مسئولیت رفتن به هر مکانی را بر عهده داشته باشید ، بنابراین این نوع خوبی است. (قدم زدن در یک دایره به طوری
"اوه خدا! ماشین من شروع نمی شود. من نمی توانم کار کنم. من هرگز تبلیغ نمی شوم. من یک شکست هستم.
er درست بود او همیشه درست است ، عوضی. من حق داشتم که او را اشتباه کنم. او به من قرض نداد
پول برای ماشین که واقعاً به آن احتیاج دارم. نمی فهمید؟ " مردم عاشق مشکلات خود هستند.
مردم به مشکلات خود متصل می شوند ، مانند این ، آنها را برای همیشه دور می کنند:
(وس روی یکی از صندلی های کارگردان قرار می گیرد و وقتی که به آرامی در طول صحنه قدم می زند ، آن را می کشد)
آنها آنها را به مهمانی ها می آورند. "چطور پیش می رود؟"
(خنده) r
مردم هرگز نمی دانند که وقتی با بودن روبرو می شوند در مورد چه چیزی صحبت کنند ، بنابراین آنها در مورد آنها صحبت می کنند
مشکلات آنها "سلام ، آیا من در مورد مشکل خود به شما گفتم؟"
(خنده) r
برخی از افراد در مشکل خود دکترا می شوند. "اوه ، من آن را درک کرده ام." برخی از افراد
آنها برای گوش دادن به آنها می پردازند. درمانگران عاشق افرادی هستند که عاشق مشکلات خود هستند. سپس آنها آن را تجزیه و تحلیل می کنند. (بررسی یک شی خیالی)
"خوب ، این مورد خاص که من دارم خاکستری است."
برای انسان ، یک نام سازنده برای موجود در جهان است
از Dasein چنین استعاره هایی که به یک سنت معرفی می شوند ، راه را شکل می دهند
ما خود و دنیای خود را درک می کنیم. در مدل دکارتی که
چند قرن بر سنت غربی ما حاکم است ، داسین است
موضوع تفکر خودآموز-Cogito "Cogito ، Ergo Sum" و
افتتاح جهان (و برای وجود) به عنوان "شی" یا cogi-
تاتوم اگر Dasein توسعه خاص خود ذهنی باشد-
Sciousness که از آن به عنوان یک هویت یاد می شود ، باز شدن برای وجود هر چیزی است
حرف
با ارزش و ساختار حقیقت آن هویت خاص مجاز است. در این دیدگاه ها ، آنچه تعیین کننده است این است که Dasein
خود - به عنوان cogito ، یا موضوع یا هویت - "" وارد تصویر می شود "
برتری بیش از هر آنچه هست. " هرچه هست ، مجبور می شود "دوباره به
این رابطه با خود به عنوان قلمرو هنجاری "(" AWP "در QCT
129) جهان به "تصویر" من از آن تبدیل می شود و قرار می گیرد که متناسب باشد
آن تصویر جهان ، به عبارت دیگر ، همه چیز در مورد من است. برخلاف این دیدگاه ها ، هایدگر پیشنهاد می کند
استعاره ، استعاره ای که به عنوان مایکل ای. زیمرمن
خاطرنشان می کند ، در مدل دکارتی در تمام مدت ضمنی بوده است:
"فلسفه مدرن شکاف بین موضوع و موضوع ایجاد می کند
زیرا نتوانسته است متوجه شود که یک پاکسازی زمانی (transcen-
dence) برای موضوع و شیء لازم است تا خود را در آن ارائه دهند
مقام اول "(Eclipse of Self 25 ، تأکید افزود). در هاید-
مدل Gger ، موضوع ارجاع خود هنجاری وجود ندارد ، وجود دارد
به سادگی خود پاکسازی و روشنایی هر آنچه هست:
در میان موجودات به طور کلی باز است
مکان رخ می دهد یک پاکسازی ، یک روشنایی وجود دارد. فکر در مورد آنچه است ، به موجودات ،
این پاکسازی در درجه ای بیشتر از آنچه هست
موجودات بنابراین این مرکز باز نیست
احاطه شده توسط آنچه هست ؛ در عوض ، روشنایی
مرکز خود همه آنچه را که هست ، مانند
چیزی که به سختی نمی شناسیم. که
فقط در صورت وجود در آن می تواند باشد.
و در آنچه در این روش روشن است ایستادگی می کند

وجود
و آنها هرگز دریافتند که این "درک آن" و "تجزیه و تحلیل آن" و این "مطالعه آن" فقط دارد
یک مشکل برای آن: آنها هنوز "آن" را دریافت کرده اند. بنابراین ، چگونه می توان مشکل را رها کرد؟ آیا ناپدید شده است؟ چگونه
بگذارید مشکل ناپدید شود؟ این جایی است که بحث انجام می شود. بیدار شدن ما به یک چیز خوب می آییم
قسمت قول می دهم خوب ، اگر مشکلات در زبان زدن رخ می دهد ، و مشخصه های خاص آن مشکلات است
اتفاق می افتد "نباید باشد" ، چگونه می توانید یک زبان جدید را امتحان کنید؟ در مورد ایجاد؟ شما می دانید
این در حال حاضر داده شده است ، بنابراین شما باید به طور مداوم با آن مقابله کنید. راکت شما پس از ادامه کار ادامه خواهد یافت
انجمن ، من قول می دهم. و عشق آن به مشکلات پس از تالار گفتگو ادامه خواهد یافت ، من قول می دهم. و شما
من قول می دهم که شیفتگی با مشکلاتی که در راکت شما به وجود آمده است ، پس از انجمن ادامه خواهد یافت. اما
این امکان در آنچه من می گویم وجود دارد. می توانید با آن مقابله کنید: در حضور آن می توانید مصرف کنید
مشکل شما ، و با مقابله با جعبه ای که از قبل وارد می شود ، آن را تغییر دهید و اجازه دهید
جعبه - که آن را در یک جعبه جدید قرار می دهد - عمدتاً آن را در جعبه جدید قرار می دهد. بنابراین من قصد دارم به شما بدهم
نام یک جعبه جدید که می توانید مشکل خود را وارد کنید. این حقیقت نیست. مشکلات "نباید باشد"؟ این سوالی است که شما باید با آن روبرو شوید: چه کسی شما را قاضی کرده است؟ خدا خوشحال است ، احتمال شما چیست
لیم؟ چه کسی شما را قاضی کرد ، تصمیم نهایی آنچه در زندگی نباید باشد؟ قدرت زیادی نیست
در آن بنابراین این یکی را امتحان کنید. مکالمه جدیدی را در مورد مشکلات واقعی که به دست آورده اید ، مانند یک
امکان و مکالمه ای که من از شما دعوت می کنم تا آنها را در اطراف خود قرار دهید این است: در زندگی مشکلاتی وجود دارد. وس "نباید باشد" و "در زندگی مشکلات وجود دارد" در بالای جعبه با کلمه نوشت
"مشکلات" در داخل آن. وس (ادامه)
به اندازه کافی ساده در زندگی مشکلاتی وجود دارد. نه: زندگی در مورد هیچ مشکلی نیست. وقتی مشکلات
نتیجه گیری این است که زندگی بزرگ زندگی بدون مشکل است. این مزخرف است! یک زندگی
بدون مشکل یک زندگی شیطنت آمیز است. این یک زندگی بد بو است شما زندگی بدون مشکل می خواهید؟ ما یک
عملکرد کمی که می توانیم روی شما انجام دهیم. شما باید این کار را در مکزیک انجام دهید. ما حذف خواهیم کرد
تمام اندامهای داخلی خود را در آب ریز و درشت به حالت تعلیق در می آورید. این یک زندگی بدون مشکل است. قدرت
افراد کامل از مشکلات خود قضاوت می شوند. مشکل شما این است ، مشکلات شما کوچک است و
خجالت آور - و همان موارد بارها و بارها. شما خسته کننده هستید او با این بدخلقی سر و کار داشت
پایان نامه به مدت نه سال. تصور می کنید نه سال در مورد آن به او گوش می دهید؟ (خنده) r
او باید مشکلات بزرگی را به وجود آورد و او را از بین می برد. و سپس شغلی را انجام دهید
یک مشکل واقعی برای او ، و با این کار عالی عمل کنید تا زمانی که او مسئولیت بیشتری را به عهده بگیرد ، یک دانشگاه را اجرا می کند
Versity و مشکلات زیادی دارد. سپس جالب است که با او صحبت کنید. این مشکل است شما
مقاومت در برابر چیزی که تمام هیجان خود را به زندگی می بخشد - مشکلات - زیرا آنها "نباید"
باشد. " بنابراین راه تحول که مقابله با هر یک از مشکلات و کل تمایز شما است
"مشکل" و آنها را در جعبه ای به نام "در زندگی مشکلات وجود دارد" قرار دهید. خوب سوالی دارید؟ هیچ
"بله اما" و "در مورد" چطور؟ دونال
بنابراین ، من در مورد من ، وزنم را می گویم. و در زندگی مشکلاتی وجود دارد. من یک احتمال دارم
لیم که من شصت پوند بیشتر از آنچه می خواهم باشم ، یا شصت پوند بیشتر از سالم است. همانطور که در جای دیگر نشان داده ایم ، این پاکسازی هایدگر است
اره ای که در تفکر پیش از سوکراتیک ها آشکار می شود ، سایت
مبارزات اولیه که آنها به آنها ایستاده اند ، از این طریق
جهان را به وجود آورد و برای ظهور پاکسازی شد
حقیقت یک انسان پاکسازی در جهان است که همه چیز وجود دارد
چیزهایی که هستند برای هایدگر و ارهارد ، این یک نکته اصلی است: ژنرال
فکر کردن ، فکر کردن که می خواهد حقیقت بودن را غیرقانونی کند
و از این طریق موجودات سبک ، فقط در صورت وجود ایجاد شده می توانند این کار را انجام دهند
پاکسازی برای نورپردازی: "نور می تواند به سمت پاکسازی جریان یابد".
هایدگر ؛ اما نور خود هرگز پاکسازی را ایجاد نمی کند. "در عوض ، نور
پیش فرض آن "(" EP & TT "در BW 442). به گفته محقق
حرف
ویلیام لویت ، هایدگر ترجیح داده است که DA
در Da-Sein ، به عنوان صراحت ترجمه می شود تا سنتی
در آنجا (معرفی به QCT ، xxxv). یک انسان اساساً است
حرف
باز بودن هایدگر می گوید: "The Lumen Naturale ،" نور عقل ،
نور را فقط در باز "(" EP & TT "در BW 443) پرتاب می کند.
حرف
توجه داشته باشید که در حالی که داسین پاکسازی نور است ، داسین
نور نیز هست در زمان و زمان ، هایدگر به این موضوع اشاره کرد
بیان فیگوراتیو ، لومن naturale ، نشانگر وجود است-
ساختار tial-entological خود Dasein. نور یک تشکیل دهنده است
از Dasein ، و هنگامی که Dasein "به گونه ای است که می درخشد
"آنجا" باشد "(Bt 171). برای تبدیل شدن به باز شدن ، ما
حرف
همزمان به نوری تبدیل شوید که پاکسازی را روشن می کند. گفتگوی انجمن ممکن است به عنوان فرایندی برای روشن دیده شود-
از این طریق که شرکت کنندگان در انجمن هستند ، از این طریق امکان پذیر است
آنها خود را به عنوان "آنجا" برای روشنایی هستی می دانند. اولین قدم در این فرآیند ساختارشکنی شرکت کنندگان است "
ذهنیت های هنجاری ، مبارزات اولیه که به آن پاسخ می دهد
اولین سؤال از انجمن: وجود انسان چیست؟ این باز کردن سوال دوم را پاک می کند: این امکان وجود دارد
توانایی بودن برای انسان؟ از طریق این سوال دوم است
که پاکسازی روشن می شود. ■

اما هنوز مشکلی وجود ندارد ببینید "من شصت پوند بیشتر هستم که می خواهم باشم" مشکلی نیست. این "شصت پوند بیشتر از آنچه می خواهم باشم."
دونال
درست است من این را صحبت کردم من آن را زبان زدم بنابراین اگر می خواستم 235 پوند وزن کنم و وزن می کردم
235 پوند ، من خوشحال می شوم ، زیرا این مقدار می خواستم وزن کنم. وهمی
نه. من نمی دانم که شما خوشحال خواهید شد. دونال
چون این را گفتم وهمی
نه. این فقط وزن شما است. دونال
در آنجا مشکلی وجود نخواهد داشت. وهمی
هنوز نیست اگر وزن خود را وزن کرده اید ، مشکلی نیست. دونال
این یک مشکل است ... وس
اگر وزن خود را وزن کنید و نباید آن را وزن کنید ، مشکلی پیش می آید. یا شما هستید
در رژیم غذایی و به اندازه کافی سریع کار نمی کند و نباید باشد. یا سعی می کنید و کار نمی کند
و باید کار می کرد. دونال
اما اگر می خواستم 235 پوند وزن کنم و 235 پوند وزن داشته باشم ... وس
اولین قدم این است که به مشکل شما بنام "وزن شما" بگوییم که "در زندگی مشکلات وجود دارد" ، نه
"مشکل در مورد وزن من نباید باشد. من نباید با وزن خود مشکلی داشته باشم."
دونال
این همان چیزی است که من می گویم: "من نباید در مورد وزن خود مشکلی داشته باشم."

وهمی
نه بیشتر شبیه این است که "من نباید این مشکل را داشته باشم."
دونال
من نباید مشکل "وزن" را داشته باشم ، باید بیشتر شبیه رون باشم. (نشان دهنده شخصی که در کنار او نشسته است که بیشتر از دونالد به نظر می رسد)
وهمی
شماره (خنده) r
اینکه شما مشکل دارید ، اشتباه است. بدون مشکلات خود بهتر خواهید بود ، درست دونالد؟ دونال
بله وهمی
این همان چیزی است که ما با آن سر و کار داریم. دونال
اوه ، من آن را کردم. وهمی
شما بدون مشکلات خود بهتر نخواهید بود ، زیرا اگر زندگی داشته باشید ، مشکل خواهید داشت. دونال
من آن را دریافت کردم وهمی
کل "مشکلات" گروه باز شده است. ما با مشکل مشخصی که نامیده می شود برخورد نکرده ایم

من آن را دریافت کردم وهمی
شما می توانید با مشکلات خود مانند "پذیرش" یا حتی بیشتر از پذیرش بایستید. دونال

تشخیص اینکه بخشی از معامله است. دونال
درست است و این بخشی از معامله انسانی بودن است ، نه بخشی از معامله من ، نه بخشی از معامله رون. در
گوریل مشکل "وزن" ندارد. گوریل فقط گوریل است. چون ما انسان هستیم
و ما در این فرهنگ انسان ظاهر می شویم ، و ما به زبان می توانیم وزنه برداری کنیم
مشکل وهمی
نه ، ما مشکلاتی داریم که نباید مشکل داشته باشد. دونال
ما مشکلاتی داریم که نباید مشکل داشته باشد. بله به من ، وقتی آنجا را در آنجا قرار دادید
زندگی مشکلاتی وجود دارد ، که به نظر می رسید بسیار خوب است. مانند "هو ، در زندگی مشکلاتی وجود دارد." مانند
هیچ وزنی برای آنها وجود ندارد ، هیچ ... وس
نه ، شما باید مشکلاتی را که دارید داشته باشید. ببخشید مشکلاتی که شما دارید مناسب است
گران قیمت و آنها بخشی از زنده بودن شما هستند. دونال
نه فقط زنده بودن من. وهمی
درست ، زنده بودن بنابراین مناسب بودن مشکلات وجود دارد. "نباید باشد" وجود ندارد
مشکلات این بخشی از زندگی است. دونال
اوه ، در زندگی مشکلاتی وجود دارد. وهمی
دقیقاً بله بنابراین شما شروع به تغییر رابطه خود به مشکلات کرده اید. دونال
بنابراین مشکلی نیست که من مشکلی داشته باشم. این در زندگی است که من یک مشکل دارم. وهمی
بله مشکلی نیست که شما مشکلی داشته باشید. دونال
درست مثل همه افراد دیگر.
