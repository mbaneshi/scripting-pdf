Forum Day Four: Session Two 
437
don’t comprehend versus being willing to think. In order to create that distinction, Bill, and 
if you were sitting in your chair doing the demonstration, you had to think. It wasn’t given by 
thoughts; you had to really think. So I’m asking you to start thinking that thinking and distin-
guishing are synonymous—not perfectly, not neatly. But you have to think to get a distinction,
to bring forth distinction.
(to Bill)
And that’s what you were willing to do. And you were big about it. And we appreciate it.
Bill returned to his seat as the group applauded. Another participant, Joan, raised her hand and
stood.
JOAN
I feel really stupid. I didn’t get it.
KIPP
Okay. What didn’t you get?
JOAN (in tears)
I don’t understand how to make a choice without a reason. 
KIPP
The reasons are still there, aren’t they? They don’t go away.
JOAN
No they don’t. I have a zillion of them.
KIPP
What’s a current choice you need to make?
JOAN
Figuring out what I want to do with my life. It sounds really stupid. What I want to do for a job.
KIPP
Okay. “What I want to do for a job.” You have a couple diff erent ideas?
JOAN
Yes.
KIPP
Okay good. What are the ideas?
