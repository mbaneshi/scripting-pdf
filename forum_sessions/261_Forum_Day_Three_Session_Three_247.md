Forum Day Three: Session Three 247
JACOB
So is that the perfect spot?
ERHARD
No. That’s adding meaning to it. That’s a Jacobism, that last one. That’s the best one you did
because you can see it in that one. See, you’re trying to make it all right! That’s what it means to
turn it into a philosophy. You’re doing a “fi reside talk.” It’s a trap. But it’s all right that it’s a trap.
JACOB
That’s what I’m saying.
ERHARD
But that’s what ruins it. It’s not all right. It’s not not all right either. It’s just like this.
JACOB
Okay.
ERHARD
You got it. Well done, thank you.
(applause)
KIPP
Patsy, you win the prize, and a large bicep. Holding your hand up for forty minutes straight.
PATSY
Aerobics!
KIPP
Exactly.
PATSY
It’s taken me three days to get up and talk, and I love to talk...
KIPP
When should you have gotten up to talk?
PATSY
I said something the fi rst day...
KIPP
You said it took you three days to get up.

SPEAKING BEING
PATSY
Now it’s perfect that I’m up talking.
ERHARD
Certainly, if you’d gotten up earlier it would have been bad, right?
PATSY
No it would have been perfect at the time.
ERHARD
Because whatever happens is perfect, right?
PATSY
Absolutely.
ERHARD (speaking with dramatic forcefulness)
Wrong! Whatever happens is not perfect! That’s fucking California crap! Whatever happens is
whatever happens! You fucking Californians: you’re disgusting! Goddamned platitudes.
(calmly)
At any rate: you’re up.
PATSY
I really got what you said about the aces, I really got it, and as I listened to it and watched the
demonstration, all of a sudden a confl ict appeared. And that is: how many times do you throw
your aces out and you get stepped on, kicked, shit on, and you say okay, and then do it again,
and again, and the result that you wanted doesn’t happen.
KIPP
What knocked you over is the last thing you said. “The result that you wanted doesn’t happen.”
Because what always happens?
PATSY
What happens.
KIPP
So when you throw your aces out, you throw your aces out. And you don’t when you don’t.
PATSY
Right, but given that you are human...
KIPP
If you are...
