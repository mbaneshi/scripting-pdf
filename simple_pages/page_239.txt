Forum Day Three: Session Three 225
ANGEL
Nothing.
ERHARD
Oh bullshit.
KIPP
Try again. Stand up.
ERHARD
You’re a long way from nothing. When he’s done...
ANGEL (angrily)
So what? 
ERHARD
When he’s done with you, you may get to nothing. Right now you’re something.
ANGEL
Why is it important for me to be nothing?
KIPP
Well, how is something treating you right now?
ANGEL
I don’t know how to be nothing.
ERHARD (interrupting Kipp to address the group)
What you’re watching, what this is designed to do, is to let you look down to the very 
foundation of what the already always being of human beings is. You’re going to get to see 
whence you came. In this conversation—it’s gonna take hours, and given how stupid you are, 
it’s gonna take a lot of hours—and what you’re going to see if you’re watching, is whence you 
came. I mean you. What a “you” is, what an “I” is, what a “me” is. This is whence it comes. 
Remember what I said earlier about working backwards? We’re going to get all the way 
down to the bottom, to the source of you. And this is the conversation in which we’re going to 
do it. And if you watch here, and map this on to your own life, you’ll get to see where you 
came from. 
(pausing)
This is where you came from. You didn’t come from your mother. You got your body from your 
mother. This is where you came from. Remember I told you the fi rst half of The Forum was 
the already always being of human being? This is you “already always.” She sat down yesterday 
beautifully unstuck. Now she’s as stuck as she was yesterday. By the time we fi nish this 
conversation most of you will be unstuck. And by tomorrow you will be stuck again. Because 
What you’re watching, what this is designed to 
do, is to let you look down to the very founda-
tion of what the already always being of human 
beings is.
