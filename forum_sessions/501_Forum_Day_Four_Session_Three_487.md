Forum Day Four: Session Three 487
ERHARD
You can’t apply this in your life. It applies you; you don’t apply it. Weren’t you here earlier to
hear about the truth?
ART
Yes.
ERHARD
All you’ve got to do is get it. It will use you.
ART
And once I try to do it that’s when I screw it up.
ERHARD
Exactly. But that’s a little off  too because that’s another answer.
ART
Right.
ERHARD
Don’t turn it into an answer. All there is to do is to get it. Here’s what there is to get: My actions,
my way of being, my feeling, my thoughts, my self, are a correlate of the world as occurring.
You get that?
ART
Yes.
ERHARD
Good. Sit down. Very well done.
BOBBY
What I got is that you’re talking about “muscle memory.”
ERHARD
What is muscle memory? What’s the diff erence between muscle memory and muscle spirits?
(laughter)
One is in vogue and the other one is not in vogue. “The catching God moved my hands.” What’s
the diff erence between that and muscle memory? They are both explanatory principles. They
both explain what happened. And the only other diff erence is that one is in vogue and the other
is not in vogue. Neither one of them has anything to do with having any access to your behavior.
What does muscle memory have to do with having access to your behavior?
Free Relationship to Technology”). But Heidegger’s focus is a less
apparent threat, namely, the threat posed by “the technological
understanding of Being” (ibid). Technology, for Heidegger, is a
manifestation of a particular way of Being; and it is that way of
Being, rather than technology itself, that poses the real danger. ■

SPEAKING BEING
BOBBY
Well then I don’t get it. I thought that’s what you were talking about.
ERHARD
That’s not what we’re talking about. You heard me say muscle memory?
BOBBY
That’s how I translated it.
ERHARD
Yeah: Don’t translate me. I speak perfectly what I mean. If you translate it, you don’t get it.
What I said was, your actions are a correlate of the world as an occurring. Your actions are not a
product of properties inside you including something called muscle memory. You get that?
BOBBY
I heard you.
ERHARD
Did you get it?
BOBBY
Well, I’d have to translate it to get it.
ERHARD
Don’t translate it. Just get it. My actions—the way I act—are a correlate of the world as an
occurring. That’s what there is to get. I don’t act like I act because I’m stupid, or because I’m
smart, or because I’m ambitious, or because I got drive, or because I think positively. They’re
all explanatory principles. They have nothing to do with the source of action. They explain
action beautifully. You could say that you’re possessed by a certain kind of spirit. That explains
it perfectly, doesn’t it? Some people are possessed by good spirits, some are possessed by bad
spirits. Doesn’t that explain action? You don’t like that explanation. But doesn’t it explain
action? Does it not? What’s the diff erence between that explanation and the explanation that I
act because of properties inside me? The only diff erence is that one is in vogue and the other is
now out of vogue. This is a conversation for gaining access to action, not for explaining action.
Remember I told you the fi rst day? Remember that X thing? This side you get explanation, this
side you get access to the source of the action. We’re talking about the source of action, not the
explanation for action. Somebody asks you why you act the way you do, you tell them properties
because what they’re looking for is understanding. You want something to say about your
actions, start dwelling in the possibility, the distinctions, that your actions are a correlate of the
world as an occurring. Is that clear?
BOBBY
It sounds like reaction, but I know that’s not what you mean.
