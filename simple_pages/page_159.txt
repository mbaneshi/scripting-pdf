Forum Day Two: Session Three 
145
MIKE
Yeah.
ERHARD
I want to acknowledge you for not pulling one bit of shit during the two conversations you’ve 
had with me. You are an extraordinarily straight guy, who just had one racket: stupid, which 
you now know is a racket. My business is that when you run the racket you’ll know it’s a racket.
Anything else to complete for you?
MIKE
No.
ERHARD
Thanks.
(applause as Mike sits)
(to the group)
All you’ve got to do is get it straight: my racket is, the cost is, the payoff  is. That’s all you got to
get. Just that.
(looking around)
Where is Angel? Stand up and tell me what you’ve made of this so far.
Angel, who had earlier interacted with Erhard about her divorce, rose.
ERHARD
What’s your racket? My racket is...
ANGEL
I’ve had a long time to think about this so I’m supposed to know, right?
ERHARD
You’re not supposed to know anything. What do you know? My racket is...
ANGEL
That I’m a victim.
ERHARD
Very good. Yeah. You’ve got this big stupid soap opera, this stuff . The truth is you’re a racke-
teer. The truth is you’ve got this racket about being a victim. That’s the truth. Not all this soap
opera... That’s a smoke screen for being a racketeer. Your racket is that you’re a victim. Yes?
