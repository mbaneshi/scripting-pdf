SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
What’s the “ugly inside”?
JANE
My feelings.
ERHARD
Like worthless. Like being nobody.
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Do you know you made yourself “nobody”? At some point in your life something happened and you 
became “I am worthless.” It’s not that you think it. It’s that you are it. It’s not that you are worthless 
because you think you’re worthless. It’s the other way around. You are that you are “worthless” and 
therefore you think it, and you see it, and you listen it, and you smell it, taste it and touch it. You’re 
already always worthless. You’re worthless waiting to happen. Did you hear what I said?
JANE
Yeah. 
ERHARD
Now, sometime today, or at the worst, tomorrow morning, you’re going to fi nd out about this 
worthlessness business. But all I want you to get right now is that at some point in your life, something 
happened, and you made yourself worthless. It’s not that you are naturally worthless. At some point 
today you’re going to fi nd out what you are at the bottom, and it ain’t worthless. It’s something else. 
You made “being worthless.” And you’re clear there’s a payoff  to being worthless, right? 
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
What does it cost you to be worthless?
JANE
Love, happiness, self-expression.
ERHARD
Mostly self-expression. Look out there. Does it look diff erent?
JANE
Yes. Just people.
Therefore, early in The Forum, Erhard exhorted participants not 
to try to fix anything they think is wrong with them, or to lose any
“moods” they think may get in their way. Attunements are us; they
are the raw material of The Forum.
Letting them be is diff icult and not as transparent as it 
sounds.  ■
