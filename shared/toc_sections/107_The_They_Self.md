Forum Day Two: Session One

(referring to Sienna)
What she said, I felt I could identify with and so I felt that I had nothing to contribute. But for
me to really get something out of being here, I really need to say it out loud. I seem to have the
answer for myself and everyone, and I’m so busy looking good that I’m not getting my..., that
having all the answers has killed off  the possibility in my life.
WES
Like maybe you’ve killed your life.
PHOEBE
Yeah, that I’m so smart and that I’ve got it so fi gured out, that I have the answer and no possi-
bility. And I noticed when we did our homework, last night and this morning, that all that kept
coming up was lots of answers and no new stuff , which is what I think I got out of yesterday,
the possibilities of what my life could be about. That’s what I don’t have is possibility in my life.
WES
Got it. Great. Thanks.
(another participant stands)
ROSS
I’ve been waiting for the right time to get up here and say something profound and so this is the
right time, but it isn’t anything profound.
WES
The wrong time is when it is profound, so you don’t have to worry about it. How many are wait-
ing for something signifi cant, profound, before you’re going to get up to share?
(many raising their hands)
We don’t want your crummy shares! If you really listen you’ll fi nd that the most powerful shares
are some of the simplest and dealing with the most ordinary aspects of our life. From the power
and insight of The Forum to shed light on the ordinary aspects of our life, you’ll fi nd some of
the most powerful things you’ve listened to. Thanks for acknowledging that.
ROSS
What happened for me yesterday and last night and I’m convinced, also while I was sleeping,
was just the continuous looking again at all the beliefs, a lot of the things that I’ve been work-
ing on in this area, and opening up diff erent possibilities for it, and starting really, one of the
reasons why I came to The Forum was that I wanted to take a look at what the barriers were for
my success. I’ve been successful in the past, I’ve been able to create the things that I’ve wanted,
and then they slipped away, for whatever reason, and I really want to take a look at what those
barriers were and what’s been happening. All yesterday and last night, and this morning is, let’s
take a look at the distinctions. They’re really starting to separate. I fi nd that I spend a lot of time
and energy in the story, and very little time dealing with what’s happening.
as well as the Interval “Dasein: Meaning and Mineness” at the end
of Session Two, Day One). A dog can be a dog only for a human
being; only for a human can a sunset be beautiful. But also among
the entities freed by Dasein to be in the world are other human
beings—entities which are “like the very Dasein which frees them,
in that they are there too, and there with it” (BT 154).
T
These terms—with and too—are to be understood existential-
ly. That is, Being-there-too does not mean merely that the Others
are present-at-hand in the world, available to be encountered.
Heidegger is not describing a situation in which beings are located
alongside each other in world space; rather he is distinguishing
integral elements of the beings themselves. Withness is a part of
Dasein’s Being—my own Dasein, and the Dasein of Others. The
“too,” says Heidegger, means a “sameness of Being” (BT 154).
T
Heidegger makes precise use of hyphenation in languaging
the ontological world-structure he is proposing. Early on in Being
and Time, he specifies that Things—substances, equipment,
objects of nature—are within the world, a location-relationship
that he indicates by the absence of hyphenation (BT 91). Here, he
T
posits a further specification:
“
Thus Dasein’s world frees entities which are
not only quite distinct from equipment and
Things, but which also—in accordance with
their kind of being as Dasein themselves—are
‘in’ the world in which they are at the same
time encountered within-the-world, and are
‘in’ it by way of Being-in-the-world. . . . So if
one would want to identify the world in gen-
eral with entities within-the-world, one would
have to say that Dasein too is ‘world.’ (BT 154)
T
So because Dasein—mine and the Others’—are in-the-world exis-
tentially, we can be encountered “in” the world environmentally.
Once again, we call attention to the deeply reflexive nature
of Heidegger’s ontological distinctions. His languaging repeatedly
turns thinking back upon itself, since his goal is to have us bend
back to see ourselves from a new perspective.

SPEAKING BEING
WES
Yeah.
ROSS
And in the short time that I’ve been doing this, I’ve already noticed some openness come into
the picture.
WES
Yeah, what if you lived your life totally in a story? Just consider that as a possibility. Now I
know you can always fi nd exceptions, but you know the exception only shows the rule. So don’t
look at the exceptions. Stand in the possibility that your whole life is a story. And as you get
the distinction “story versus what happened,” you might notice that life is passing by, and that
you’re in a story about life. You’re not in life.
ROSS
There were lots of things that I took a look at last night and the major thing that I’d like to share
with you is integrity... is probably one of my major inauthenticities, at least there’s a possibility
for that. And I’m real quick to pick it up in somebody else. Actually as a result of yesterday I’ve
been able to look at some of the possibilities where I am not in integrity. I did an exercise with
my daytimer, and I realized that all the things that are really important to me just didn’t get
done. And so there’s one major commitment not kept, which I really felt to be important to me
having accomplished.
WES
Great. Thank you.
MARSHA
Last night when I went home, I guess things were starting to get uncovered because I was so
angry. My normal thing is to be the cheerleader and get up in the morning and get things done
and extend myself so far wide that there’s nothing left for me. It is starting to wear on me physi-
cally, and what I got last night was that I am so angry, so angry: at me. It came across at fi rst last
night, being so angry at Werner. I did the training 15 years ago, but if I saw Werner out in the
parking lot last night I would have run him over. I was so angry. I chewed off  my sister-in-law’s
head last night. It has never been expressed like this before, because it has been so important
to me to express, to get across, “you don’t like me and I’m going to make you like me,” and that
has taken a tremendous amount of energy, and what is underneath that is just a lot of anger.
WES
And anything underneath that?
MARSHA
I don’t know yet. I’m just really into the anger now.
In Heidegger’s account of Being-with, we find “world” per-
vaded by relatedness. The presence of Others is embedded in all
of our everyday activities. When we are at work on a project, the
Others for whom the project is being performed are encountered
in the work. If we walk along the edge of a field, the field “shows
itself as belonging to such and such a person.” If I am at leisure,
the book I am reading “was bought at So-and-so’s shop and given
by such-and-such a person, and so forth” (BT 154).
T
Heidegger is not making the obvious point that the book
belongs to someone, but is emphasizing the degree to which the
presence of my relatedness to Others imbues my existence. Others
whom I encounter in these objects and activities are a part of my
world and in the same way I am a part of theirs.
“
By reason of this with-like Being-in-the-world,
the world is always the one that I share with
Others. The world of Dasein is a with-world.
Being-in is Being-with Others. Their Being-
in-themselves within-the-world is Dasein-with.
(BT 155)
clearing for me. Others make it possible for me to Be, a situation
that persists even when no Other is present.
“
Even Dasein’s Being-alone is Being-with in the
world. The Other can be missing only in and for
a Being-with. Being-alone is a deficient mode of
Being-with; its very possibility is the proof of
this. (BT 156–157)
T
Thus Heidegger has distinguished in withness an extraordi-
nary existential possibility for human relatedness, a possibility
which we see as an essential element of The Forum transforma-
tion. Here he specifies another aspect of this connection:
“
Being-with is such that the disclosedness of
the Dasein-with of Others belongs to it; this
means that because Dasein’s Being is Being-
with, its understanding of Being already

WES
You’re present to your anger.
MARSHA
I’m very present to my anger. And I am not a nice person. I’m really getting that I’m, a couple peo-
ple looked around here and “oh boy, what a bitch she is.” And I’m saying, I am the biggest fl aming
bitch. And I’ve covered that up for a long time.
WES (to the group)
Consider the possibility that you are a “covering-up.” I did not say you have a covering-up. I said
consider the possibility that you are a covering-up. See, when she deals with herself, deals with
the covering up; cheerleader on top of angry woman, but that’s who she is.
At this point (10:30 am) Erhard appeared at the back of the room, and spoke in response to the
conversation about covering up. His attire remained the same throughout The Forum: today the
sweater-vest was olive-green, the slacks brown.
ERHARD
The way it works operationally is—it’s something you’re afraid you might be—is angry. There’s
always a something happened—always, always. However it is that you are, there’s always a
“something happened” that caused that. And almost nobody knows that because they come at
the way they are from the conceptual side, from the descriptive side, from the explanatory side.
When you get to the source of the way you are, there’s always a “something happened.” You put
yourself together, fashioned yourself as you were growing up. We pay attention, particular atten-
tion to various aspects of what we call our selves, or what we might call, more accurately, your
identity at various eras of our growing up. In a certain era of your growing up, you were building
a certain part of your identity. And at another era you built another part of your identity. And
then sometimes you go back and put the fi nishing touches on something you built earlier. But I
want you to begin to be able to think that people are manufactured. You and I are constructed.
Whatever it is that you’re referring to when you say “I think,” whatever the “I” refers to, you call
that your self, or your identity—sometimes you’ll call it your personality. But whatever is being
referred to when you say “I think,” “I feel,” “I believe”; and it gets put together out of “what hap-
peneds”; and there’s a “what happened” for every piece of you. A lot of who you are, of how you
got to be the way you are, and a lot of what maintains your identity is a product of what you’re
afraid you might be. Something happened in Marsha’s life, and she decided it was wrong to be
angry, or she shouldn’t be angry, or only bad people are angry, or something like that.
(Marsha is weeping; Erhard addresses another participant)
Don’t help her. Thanks.
(continuing)
And she decided that was wrong or bad or something she shouldn’t be, and then she got to be
afraid that she might be that, and so she had to keep that down in the swamp, at the bottom of
the Valley of the Shadow of Death, and it’s been there for years, and it runs her life: what she’s
afraid she might be. See I don’t even know that she is angry. I don’t know that the truth about
implies the understanding of Others. This un-
derstanding, like any understanding, is not an
acquaintance derived from knowledge about
them, but a primordially existential kind of
Being, which, more than anything else, makes
such knowledge and acquaintance possible.
(BT 160–161)
Of course, says Heidegger, the factical development of my
relatedness with another human being will always depend upon
how well I have come to know myself. And here he makes a point
that is significant for our understanding of The Forum dynamic:
self-knowledge, he says, arises from relatedness to Others:
“
Of course it is indisputable that a lively mutual
acquaintanceship on the basis of Being-with,
oft en depends upon how far one’s own Dasein
has understood itself at the time; but this
means that it depends only upon how far one’s
essential Being with Others has made itself
transparent and has not disguised itself. And
that is possible only if Dasein, as Being-in-the-
world, already is with Others. (BT 162)
We propose that the transformation that occurs for participants
in The Forum is not an individual experience, but that the
self-knowledge it makes available arises mutually with an under-
standing of others.
This is the function of The Forum’s dialogic structure, in which
even participants who do not participate overtly in the conversa-
tion are able to find themselves in the sharing of others. Forum par-
ticipants are repeatedly exhorted to listen to others’ sharing “like
that’s you in some way speaking.” As the sharing continues, The
Forum leader persistently deconstructs each participant’s story
about his or her experience, and frames the experience instead in
the language of the distinctions being developed. The distinctions
gradually reveal the ontological structures underlying the expe-
riences, structures common to all of the experiences despite the
diff erences in their details.
96
SPEAKING BEING
Marsha is that she’s an angry person. I know that’s what’s running her life. Once she’s able to be
with being angry, once she’s able to give being to being angry, she might fi nd out she’s not angry
g
at all. But “not being angry” is going to run her life until she’s able to be angry. I know you don’t
get all that yet. You’re starting to get it. As you go along today you will get it. Before you get out
of here, you will get at the source of your identity. What happens if you get at the source of your
identity, somebody with a yellow name tag?
Participant (who is wearing a yellow name tag, i.e. someone doing The Forum for the fi rst time)
It doesn’t own you anymore.
ERHARD
Yeah. It’s that simple. This is something almost nobody knows. You’re now one of the few people in
the world that knows this. What everybody else in the world knows is that you’ve got to fi x what’s
wrong with you, you’ve got to avoid what’s bad, in you or in life. What you now know is any time
you get at the source of something, you are no longer limited to it. Most people would be afraid to do
what Marsha has done. They fi nd anger so abhorrent, that they are afraid they might fi nd out that
they are angry. And they can’t tolerate that, they can’t be with that, and so they never get to the being
angry like that’s a possible way of being; they fi ght against being angry, they reject it. In the 70s you
were supposed to let it all hang out. That’s indulging anger, that doesn’t work either. When you felt
angry you were supposed to spray it all over the place on people. That’s indulging the anger. That’s as
much bullshit as suppressing the anger. There’s a thing called responsibility. As I told you yesterday
you don’t know what that means yet, but we’ll get to it before we’re done here. Something close to
owning something, being able to be with it. So you want to take a look down in the swamp down
there at what you’re afraid you might be or hoped you weren’t, or don’t want to be. That’s where the
monsters are. The green slimy monsters of what you’re afraid to be are running your life. Most of us
would be afraid to get at it, because we’re afraid we might be
t
it. When you own that, at its source, it
e
no longer owns you. We’re afraid to get at it for fear that we might be it. What you’re afraid of owns
you. Marsha, what did you notice in there?
MARSHA
I notice that I’m angry at everybody and everything in this world.
Erhard (to the group)
You want to get the courage in that. She’s angry waiting to happen: already always angry. It’s all
over the place. It colors the clearing in which the world occurs for her. And only to the degree
she is willing to be with that, standing in front of 800 people and starting to communicate it,
you’re starting to be with it. That’s a lot diff erent than hoping you’re not that. You were saying?
MARSHA
There isn’t one person in this world that I’m not angry with.
ERHARD
And that’s sad for you.
Through this process, as people in the room hear their own
concerns repeatedly expressed in the speaking of others, not only
do they gain a new way of understanding their own situation, but
at the same time, through the mutuality implicit in the Forum’s
dialogic structure, the withness of Being-with-Others is gradually
brought to presence. The dialogue of The Forum thus unconceals
the possibility of a profound relationship of Being among human
beings. This relatedness, we propose, is at a deeper and more fun-
damental level than the diff erences—of race, ethnicity, religion, or
politics—that occur for us as persistent barriers to cooperation in
all aspects of our lives. Erhard’s work, and its expanding manifes-
tation in the current programs of Landmark Worldwide, create the
possibility for transcending those barriers. ■
ERHARD (continuing)
“
So you want to take a look down in the swamp
down there at what you’re afraid you might
be or hoped you weren’t, or don’t want to
be. That’s where the monsters are. The green
slimy monsters of what you’re afraid to be are
running your life. Most of us would be afraid to
get at it, because we’re afraid we might be it.
When you own that, at its source, it no longer
owns you.
Forum Day Two: Session One
97
MARSHA
Yeah, because I want relationships with people, and I can’t get close.
ERHARD
Listen up here, because most of you are not going to have the courage for this. So you need
to get it from those who do have the courage. That there’s something sad for her about being
angry—that’s why she’s afraid she might be angry, then it’s all mashed in with being close.
Convoluted in a knot.
MARSHA
My whole life has been an act about being happy and cheerful, giving and caring, getting every-
body to like me, and they do. The truth is that I don’t have an enemy in the world.
ERHARD
Hold on for a second. So if you’re a person who has the skills that Marsha has, the skills of be-
ing related to people well, and somehow that’s not nurturing her deeply and profoundly; that’s
not leaving her full of joy, because it’s there in order for her not to be angry! Do you hear the
in-order-to? In order not to be angry?
Marsha remained standing while Erhard worked with several other participants.
ERHARD
So if I’m nice in order not to be angry, what persists? You’ve got to get clear on this. Who’s not
clear on this?
A participant named Mike stood.
ERHARD
So Mike, if I relate well, in order not to be angry, when I relate well, what’s always there is being
angry. It’s being there as something I’m resisting.
Erhard approached another participant, and did a demonstration in which each man grasped the
other’s hands and attempted to push the other away.
ERHARD
So if I’m resisting something, I’m attached to what I’m resisting. All this relating-well dances
around anger, is attached to anger. I never have any profound sense of being related, because
what persists under being related is being angry all the time. I don’t have a deep sense of fulfi ll-
ment out of relating well, because what persists is being angry all the time. See, I’m not related
well in order to be related, I’m related well in order not to be angry. You ever notice that real
nice people, when you crack their shell a little bit, there’s a lot of dissatisfaction and sadness?
You know, there’s a lot of real nice people in here; all you got to do is crack the surface and then
there’s dissatisfaction. Is it starting to be clear?
98
SPEAKING BEING
MIKE
Just a bit. I see you pushing against this gentleman over here, and I’m understanding something
about anger. You’re saying, pushing it away, it’s still there. Kind of fuzzy.
ERHARD
When I push him away, am I not attached to him?
MIKE
You’re touching him yes.
ERHARD
No, attached to him. I can’t get away from him as I’m pushing him away, can I?
MIKE
No you can’t.
ERHARD
So in a sense I’m attached to him, am I not?
MIKE
And you’re doing the attaching.
ERHARD
Never mind who is doing the attaching.
Erhard returned to the other participant and had him hold Erhard’s shoulders.
ERHARD
So, he’s got me now, right? And I can’t get away. He’s holding on to me, right?
MIKE
Right.
ERHARD
What’s the diff erence between that and this?
Erhard pushed the participant as he did in the previous instance.
ERHARD
In terms of being attached? Whether John is holding on to me, or I’m pushing him away, we are
r
equally attached.
MIKE
Okay.
Forum Day Two: Session One
99
ERHARD
So, whatever it is you’re resisting, it’s exactly the same in its end result as what it is you’re
indulging. If I’m addicted to anger, I’m no more or less attached to anger than if I was resisting
anger. Clear about that part?
MIKE
I am clear about that part.
ERHARD
Good. Let’s go to the next part. By virtue of not being angry... You see, what being eff ective at re-
lating is about for Marsha, it’s about not being angry. So what’s the result of relating eff ectively?
MIKE
I’m lost.
ERHARD
You’re not lost. You’re intelligent. You’re clear that you don’t understand what I’m saying. Say-
ing you understand when you don’t is “lost.” Clear?
t
MIKE
I want to say yes, but... go ahead.
ERHARD
Is it clear that you aren’t lost?
MIKE
It’s clear that I don’t know what you are talking about right now.
ERHARD
Yeah. That’s pretty clear isn’t it? So you’re not lost. You’re clear.
MIKE
I got that.
ERHARD
Good. Now we’re going back to this business about “if I relate well in order to avoid anger,”
what is the result of my relating well?
MIKE
I’m avoiding the anger.
ERHARD
Perfect. Is there any satisfaction in that? Is that going to leave you whole?
100
SPEAKING BEING
MIKE
It’ll delay confronting the anger.
ERHARD
It might do that but that’s not my point. My point is that being well related with somebody
ought to be a source of fulfi llment and satisfaction, yes?
MIKE
That’s a presupposition.
ERHARD
Yeah: A fairly safe one. If you and I are well related, there ought to be a sense of being fulfi lled
by that.
MIKE
Okay.
ERHARD
But if you and I are well related in order to avoid being angry, the result of being well related
is not satisfaction and fulfi llment: it is avoiding being angry. So you can be well related all over
the place and it’s not going to leave you full of joy or profoundly satisfi ed. It’s going to leave you
having avoided anger. You won and they gave you the booby prize. Is that clearer?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
There are accomplished people who are not nurtured by their accomplishments, because they
are accomplished in order to not be something they’re avoiding being.
(to Mike)
Do you get that?
MIKE
Partially.
ERHARD
Okay, let’s get it completely clear.
MIKE
Okay.
“
But if you and I are well related in order to
avoid being angry, the result of being well
related is not satisfaction and fulfillment: it is
avoiding being angry.
Forum Day Two: Session One
101
ERHARD
This is a room full of highly accomplished people. And you know accomplished people?
MIKE
Sure.
ERHARD
And they are not necessarily profoundly satisfi ed, are they?
MIKE
No they’re not.
ERHARD
And they’re not full of joy.
MIKE
No they’re not.
ERHARD
There’s something wrong there. When people see that, like you and me, we start to come up
with these stupid conclusions. “Well, life isn’t worth it after all. You get all this stuff  done and
so what?” “Is that all there is? I got to be the president of the company,” or “I raised a wonderful
family. Success is shit. Do what you want.” People give up accomplishment: all these weird solu-
tions. Accomplishment doesn’t work for people because they do it in order not to be something.
Clear?
MIKE
I get the theory.
ERHARD
Once you get what you call the theory, you want to stand in that theory and look at life. People
who get married in order to not be lonely, even when they are successful in the marriage, sim-
ply end up being not lonely, while still being attached to “lonely.” This whole big possibility of
being married or being related, they’re not there. They’re in “lonely.” Clear?
MIKE
That part is clear.
ERHARD
Which part isn’t clear?
MIKE
I’m just trying to digest everything.
NOTE: This is a “hint” toward the conversation near the end
of Day Three called “There’s something wrong here.”
