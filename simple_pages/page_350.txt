SPEAKING BEING
you’ve been withholding from life is your self. And you put the two together and you look at life 
from the possibility that you’re going to die: What’s the point? I mean really, what is the point? 
Why not just give it up? Where’s Kevin? I wasn’t in the room earlier. I hear you turned in your 
video release today. Congratulations. That’s giving something up. I invited you last night to 
confront what it costs, the risk... you want to share about that?
KEVIN
Kind of funny, because after I got my standing ovation from everyone, I sat here thinking, “I 
don’t want to put my hand up, because I’ve already received too much attention. So I’ll just sit 
here.” And it took me about, I don’t know, a half an hour before I fi nally realized “I could put 
my hand up and they could choose me whenever they wanted. I wasn’t in control...”
(laughter)
WES
That’s very good. 
KEVIN
Yeah, I got a lot...
WES
Wait, let me just use that, because a number of people have been coming up to me demanding 
I call on them to share. You ought to get what Kevin is saying. You either will or you won’t and 
you’ll know it at the end of The Forum if you’ve been called on. Don’t worry about it because it 
doesn’t mean anything anyway. 
KEVIN
And you’re not going to get any more out of it if you’re called on.
WES
You want to listen. That’s when you get something out of The Forum. The Forum takes place in 
your listening.
KEVIN
And I know that because as I was sitting here, I was thinking about that, “well, it doesn’t mat-
ter if I get called on, if I get called on, that’s fi ne, I get called on.” 
ERHARD
It’s not even fi ne. You get called on, you get called on.
KEVIN
You’re right.
WES (continuing)
