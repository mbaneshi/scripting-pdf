SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Really? Are you a linguist?
PAUL
Yeah, I speak three languages.
ERHARD
I didn’t ask if you speak three languages, I asked if you understood language. Is that your busi-
ness? Is language your business?
PAUL
No, but I speak several languages.
ERHARD
How many people in this room speak several languages?
(many hands raised)
I have a lot of respect for people who speak several languages. I don’t mean any disrespect, but
it doesn’t mean you know shit about language. 
PAUL
Well, language encompasses a pattern of thought, a process of thought. It’s contained within
the language you think within. Like I was referring to with Spanish, you have within the lan-
guage incorporated a structure for dealing with the fact that some things are hypothetical, some 
things are real...
ERHARD  (to the group)
You want to listen to this very carefully, because otherwise you’re going to stand up and do this. 
And I’m going to let him do this long enough that you can see what it looks like. Go on Paul.
PAUL
The point is, I agree, that to be inauthentic is to, you’re saying that it is to, to do something, to 
say you’re going to do something and, nobody knows, I could say I’m going to walk over here,
and the world may end before I get there.
ERHARD
That’s not my point. That’s not what I said.
PAUL
Well, what is the point?
