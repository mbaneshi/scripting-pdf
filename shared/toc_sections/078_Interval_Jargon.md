Areas of Greatest Impact
Before attending the workshop, we asked participants to indicate areas where they felt they needed improvement. Very
few people felt they needed a great deal of improvement in many of the 68 areas we questioned. Yet after the workshop,
many participants realized that they could improve themselves and their job performance dramatically in ways they hadn‚Äôt
considered before the workshop. The ranking below shows the areas where the workshop had the greatest impact.
Being able to acknowledge mistakes fully and do what is necessary
to correct them.
Being fully committed to my company‚Äôs success.
Having high standards of quality for myself and the people who
work with me and for me.
Confronting difficult situations head-on instead of avoiding them.
Always listening carefully and attentively to other people at work.
Being as concerned with the performance of my department/division
and the company overall as I am with my own performance.
Always being responsive to the concerns of those who work for me.
Being quick to give recognition to others for the work they do.
Welcoming constructive criticism from others.
Being very effective in communicating work related issues with
my co-workers.

SPEAKING BEING
7:50 pm: Erhard‚Äôs manner was light and casual as he opened this session, interrupted by a number
of people who were returning late from the meal break. The first participant to stand shared that in
looking for issues to put at stake, he found that his issues were already big enough and did not feel
he needed to invent new ones. Erhard noticed an empty seat and began to manage people missing.
ERHARD
I made up my mind not to call you assholes any more, but I want you to know it‚Äôs very hard.
Speaking about issues and what you can have at stake...
(drawing a large circle on the chalkboard)
Let that circle represent everything there is to know. Everyone in The Forum is successful. We
know from independent studies of The Forum that participants are above average in their abil-
ity to succeed. So a certain amount of what is in this circle you know, and you know that you
know.
(drawing a small wedge in the circle)
What we do to be successful and able is we put what we know to use. That‚Äôs what common
sense tells us to do with what we know that we know. But there is also some stuff that we don‚Äôt
know, and know that we don‚Äôt know.
(adding a larger wedge)
The older I‚Äôve gotten, the more I know I don‚Äôt know. Common sense tells us that to find out
what we know that we don‚Äôt know, we need to go to school, read a book, take a seminar. I‚Äôd
like you to see that you really fit that. The rest of the pie is what you don‚Äôt know that you don‚Äôt
know. What does common sense tell you to do about that? Nothing. Common sense is silent on
that subject. What The Forum is about is what you don‚Äôt know that you don‚Äôt know‚Äîwhat‚Äôs
behind you that you can‚Äôt see. The purpose of The Forum is to provide access to what you didn‚Äôt
know that you didn‚Äôt know. In independent surveys, people have reported that The Forum is the
single most dramatic learning experience in their life.
(drawing a point on the second chalkboard)
When you take a point, which has zero dimensions, and extend it into the first dimension, you
get a line.
(drawing a line extending from the point)
You don‚Äôt get a bigger and better point. Then, when you extend the line into the second dimen-
sion, you don‚Äôt get a bigger and better line: you get a plane.
(drawing out from the line to form a square)
And when you extend a two-dimensional plane into the third dimension, you don‚Äôt get a bigger
and better plane, you get a three dimensional figure, in this case, a cube.
(building from the square, Erhard drew a cube)
Almost invariably, the results of our life are results from extending ourselves on the same
dimension. But adding a new dimension is an exponential leap. You want to listen up here and
get this! The Forum doesn‚Äôt push out on the dimensions of living already available to you. What
FORUM DAY ONE:
SESSION FOUR
Forum Day One: Session Four
69
it does is add a dimension. So there‚Äôs an exponential leap in the possibility of Being. And that‚Äôs
maybe why there are these outrageous claims people make about what they got from participat-
ing in The Forum.
PARTICIPANT
Couldn‚Äôt you add a fourth slice to the pie? Intuition? What you know but don‚Äôt know that you
know.
ERHARD
Yes, that‚Äôs very legitimate. You didn‚Äôt get the point about dimensionality?
(adding it to the model on the board)
In a point, you have no degrees of freedom. In a line, one dimension, you get one degree of free-
dom, and so on, and we simply expand on that one degree of freedom. The Forum adds a new
dimension. You get an exponential leap of possibility.
PARTICIPANT
It‚Äôs what you don‚Äôt know that you don‚Äôt know.
ERHARD
Exactly.
PARTICIPANT
How do you get there?
ERHARD
You‚Äôre in here four days and one evening. You‚Äôll see how it‚Äôs done by the end of the third day.
Anybody else here not get this dimensionality?
PARTICIPANT
Could you say that what The Forum does is to ‚Äúunconceal‚Äù a new dimension?
ERHARD
Yes, that‚Äôs a technical term for it. It‚Äôs called unconcealing. What begins to get you into this
domain of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know that you don‚Äôt know‚Äù is to dwell in the power of the question. We‚Äôre
hungry for answers, addicted to answers. People hate being in the question; they want the
answer. You don‚Äôt get answers. Light gets shed on what you are concerned with. That‚Äôs not the
way you and I are usually. The way you and I are is hungry for answers. What do I do about it?
The beginning of gaining access to what you don‚Äôt know that you don‚Äôt know, the beginning of
establishing a new dimension for being, a new dimension for living, is to start to dwell in the
question, develop the courage and the stamina and the wherewithal to orient yourself around
‚Äú
Can you formulate a question, the asking
of which is empowering? So that you‚Äôd be
willing to stay in the question?
70
SPEAKING BEING
questions the asking of which makes a difference. There are certain questions, just the asking of
which impacts people‚Äôs ability in life. See, you and I don‚Äôt look for those questions, we look for
answers, which you can only find in what you know that you don‚Äôt know. This is about devel-
oping questions the asking of which gives access to what you don‚Äôt know that you don‚Äôt know
about your life, about other people, and about living. The Forum is about developing a certain
muscle for asking questions the mere asking of which makes a difference.
Here Erhard read a passage from Heidegger‚Äôs On the Way to Language (page 13), in which Heidegger
recounts his dialogue with a Japanese scholar:
ERHARD (reading)
‚ÄúJapanese: We Japanese do not think it strange if a dialogue leaves undefined what is really
intended...‚Äù
(to the group)
That‚Äôs not very familiar to most of us, is it? In our dialogues we want to get definition very
quickly. We want it explained.
(continuing to read)
‚Äú...or even restores it back to the keeping of the undefinable.
Inquirer: That is part, I believe, of every dialogue that has turned out well between thinking be-
ings. As if of its own accord, it can take care that that undefinable something not only does not
slip away, but displays its gathering force ever more luminously in the course of the dialogue.‚Äù
(to the group)
That means putting it back into ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know that you don‚Äôt know.‚Äù It‚Äôs a harmonic with what
I read you earlier about the unspoken. See, what you‚Äôre looking for here is light, not answers.
Insight you can‚Äôt create by the numbers. What you want if you‚Äôre going to create is light, not
answers. Listen up, goddammit!
(continuing to read)
‚ÄúOur dialogues with Count Kuki probably failed to turn out so well. We younger men chal-
lenged him much too directly to satisfy our thirst for handy information.‚Äù
(to the group)
You‚Äôre here listening for answers. You‚Äôre listening for what we call ‚Äútips.‚Äù Nothing worthwhile in life
can be gotten there by ten steps. Or twenty steps. You can‚Äôt dance knowing where to put your feet.
(continuing to read)
‚ÄúInquirer: Thirst for knowledge and greed for explanations never lead to a thinking inquiry.
Curiosity is always the concealed arrogance of a self-consciousness that banks on a self-invent-
ed ratio and its rationality.‚Äù
(to the group)
What that all means is that this greed, this thirst, the question, ‚ÄúHow am I going to use this?‚Äù‚Äî
that‚Äôs a product, according to this guy, of a concealed arrogance, an arrogance that everything
‚Äú
There are certain questions, just the asking of
which impacts people‚Äôs ability in life.
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day One: Session Four
71
in life that‚Äôs worth knowing is merely an extension of what I already know. But the truth is that
everything worth knowing is going to violate what you know.
(continuing to read)
‚ÄúThe will to know does not will to abide in hope before what is worthy of thought.‚Äù
(to the group)
I think all there is, is having thoughts. But there are certain things that if you stand in front of
them in a certain way, give you thinking. If you stand in front of things worthy of thought you
get thinking. Thinking is a dance with that about which you are thinking. When you stand in
front of questions worthy of thought, you get thinking. Now that‚Äôs tough, because we‚Äôre in the
rainstorm called ‚ÄúI think.‚Äù We‚Äôre all Cartesians. No one‚Äôs had an original thought since then
about thinking‚Äîat least not one that has gotten to you or me. You and I are still Cartesians. But
there are possibilities beyond Descartes. And they give you access to a new way of being that
you can‚Äôt get to‚Äîbeing the kind of person you already always are. We‚Äôre going to be thinking.
That‚Äôs the way The Forum works. It goes backwards.
PARTICIPANT
What about disciplines that promise ‚Äúinner transcendence‚Äù?
ERHARD
Inner transcendence. That‚Äôs what California is about. I don‚Äôt want to insult your pet project,
but I am not a guy in a diner about getting someplace. And you aren‚Äôt going to get there leaping
over being human. There‚Äôs no possibility of being beyond what you already always are until you
own what you already always are. Californians don‚Äôt like that. Californians have this magical
bullshit they believe in. That‚Äôs not the way The Forum works. The Forum‚Äôs got two pieces to it.
The first is an inquiry into the already always being of human being. What kind of an opening
are you for life? What‚Äôs the color of the clearing you are for life? To say that more rigorously:
what is the already always condition of being for human beings? What did you get yourself
into here? Not your individual version of being human. That‚Äôs the question of ninety percent of
The Forum. That‚Äôs called going backwards. It‚Äôs about owning yourself as you already are. Being
authentic about inauthenticity is particularly frightening for Californians. We don‚Äôt want to be
inauthentic. Why? Because it looks bad. And I don‚Äôt like looking bad. And your life is about
looking good. This is moving backwards to own what I already always am. This is not individ-
ualistic except that each of us has his or her own version, we got wet in this rainstorm called
human being. What is it to be a human being? See, people don‚Äôt ask that question. They want to
be thinner, younger, sexier. Those questions don‚Äôt give thinking. Because it is a question worthy
of thought it creates the possibility of thinking.
The Forum is two questions. The first: what is the already always being of human beings? Being
human owns you. It gives you your life. The second half of The Forum is another question. The
second question is, what is the possibility of being for human beings? What‚Äôs possible beyond
what I was given to be? I did what‚Äôs called in Zen the low road. In the low road you must do
everything that doesn‚Äôt work. So I‚Äôm not a guy in a diner about the low road. Most people want
‚Äú
There‚Äôs no possibility of being beyond what
you already always are until you own what
you already always are.
