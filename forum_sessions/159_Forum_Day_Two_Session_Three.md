Forum Day Two: Session Three

MIKE
Yeah.
ERHARD
I want to acknowledge you for not pulling one bit of shit during the two conversations you’ve
had with me. You are an extraordinarily straight guy, who just had one racket: stupid, which
you now know is a racket. My business is that when you run the racket you’ll know it’s a racket.
Anything else to complete for you?
MIKE
No.
ERHARD
Thanks.
(applause as Mike sits)
(to the group)
All you’ve got to do is get it straight: my racket is, the cost is, the payoff  is. That’s all you got to
get. Just that.
(looking around)
Where is Angel? Stand up and tell me what you’ve made of this so far.
Angel, who had earlier interacted with Erhard about her divorce, rose.
ERHARD
What’s your racket? My racket is...
ANGEL
I’ve had a long time to think about this so I’m supposed to know, right?
ERHARD
You’re not supposed to know anything. What do you know? My racket is...
ANGEL
That I’m a victim.
ERHARD
Very good. Yeah. You’ve got this big stupid soap opera, this stuff . The truth is you’re a racke-
teer. The truth is you’ve got this racket about being a victim. That’s the truth. Not all this soap
opera... That’s a smoke screen for being a racketeer. Your racket is that you’re a victim. Yes?

SPEAKING BEING
ANGEL
Yes.
ERHARD
And what is the payoff  for being a victim? Take your time and look up there and say what the
payoff  is.
(pausing as Angel stares at the chalkboard
(
)
Puzzling, isn’t it?
ANGEL
I don’t know what I get to be right about. I get to be right about what?
ERHARD
About being sincere.
ANGEL
And deeply emotional and caring. You forgot about that.
ERHARD
Yeah, you’re not deeply emotional and caring or sincere. You’re a fucking racketeer. And the
racket is being a victim and the payoff  is that it makes you right. You’ve got this bullshit golden
calf called being deeply emotional and caring and being sincere. Being emotional and caring
and sincere is bullshit. This is not holy or sacred. I didn’t say it wasn’t nice. So, you’ve got this
racket called being a victim and it makes you right because if you weren’t a victim and you
weren’t suff ering, then you would be wrong, you would be invalidated, would you not?
ANGEL
Yes.
ERHARD
You would be invalidated as a caring, deeply emotional, sincere person.
ANGEL
That’s why your telling me that I don’t hurt over my divorce invalidates and hurts.
ERHARD
I understand. I understand. All I’m doing is getting you, what I call “up on the pike,” so we can
work together on something. Did you want to say something?
ANGEL
I say that what I want to get out of The Forum is a marriage that would, like, last forever, but
obviously what I’ve been about is making sure that I never can have that.
