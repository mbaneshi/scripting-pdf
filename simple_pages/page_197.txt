Forum Day Three: Session One
183
KIPP (to the group)
I’m inviting you to keep being present to sharing.
XAVIER
I called my girlfriend. I think I’m getting things. I kid myself about getting things, and I don’t 
know shit.
KIPP
Yeah. What do you do in life?
XAVIER
I’m a student.
KIPP
Of course, you have to be a student if you don’t know shit... Somebody that doesn’t know shit 
has to be a student—because you can’t be present to “I don’t know.” If you can get that you’re 
reporting when you’re reporting—that’s worth the four days... “I was talking about rackets” is 
reporting. “I said I was full of shit” is sharing. And what did your girlfriend say?
XAVIER 
That I was just reporting on things.
KIPP
Listen. That’s worth his four days. If you can get that you’re reporting when you’re reporting, 
it’s worth the four days. And?
XAVIER
I said that I am full of shit; I am running rackets all the time.
KIPP
She said?
XAVIER
She shared about how uncomfortable it is to be called on her rackets. It’s embarrassing.
KIPP
Being alive is embarrassing. If you don’t want to be embarrassed, stay dead. 
ERHARD
It’s embarrassing to be yourself. Ask any teenager, he’ll tell you. That’s why teenagers put an 
act together. It’s innately embarrassing to be yourself. That’s how you get to be an adult when 
you’re a teenager. You learn not to be yourself. It’s true about everybody in the room. You want 
to get that. It’s embarrassing to be yourself.
