To the students in my Communication Studies classes at St. Cloud State University, who for the past twenty-five years have been 
my partners in the play and mystery of ontological inquiry; and to my wife Susan Saetre, my constant guardian angel.
BRUCE
To my friend and writing partner, Bruce Hyde (1941-2015), who blazed a trail with his unrelenting commitment to communicate 
the unsaid. What a gift  to have worked with a man of such brilliance, humor, and courage, even unto death, and with this book,
Bruce will continue to speak to each reader willing to take up the call to enter the conversation this book is but a fragment of.
I also dedicate this book to my students, ever my co-experimenters in the inquiry of what it means to be a writer and a reader; 
and to my wife Cindy, and my children, Tristan and Cassidy: I dedicate the fruits of my labor to your future.

ABOUT THE AUTHORS
BRUCE HYDE  (PhD, University of Southern California, 1990) was a Professor of 
Communication Studies at St. Cloud State University until his death on October 
13th, 2015 (1941-2015). His primary interests as an educator were with the 
ontological dimensions of language and communication, and with dialogue as a
non-polarized and non-polarizing form of public discourse.
DREW KOPP  (PhD, University of Arizona, 2009) is an Associate Professor of 
Writing Arts at Rowan University. His research interests focus on the theory and
history of rhetorical pedagogies, and he has published articles in journals in the
field of rhetoric and writing studies, including Rhetoric Review (2013), and
w
JAC:
Rhetoric, Writing, Culture, Politics (2012). He has also contributed a chapter to the
edited collection Disrupting Pedagogies in the Knowledge Society (2011).

Praise for Speaking Being
From the Aft erword:
I regard Speaking Being as an enormously important contribution to understanding 
Heidegger and Erhard. The latter has received far too little serious academic 
attention, and this book begins to make up for that lack. Moreover, the book’s 
analysis of Heidegger’s thought is among the best that I have ever read. I commend
this book to all readers without reservation.
MICHAEL E. ZIMMERMAN, Professor Emeritus, University of Colorado, Boulder
This book is powerful, imaginative, frustrating, amusing, threatening, and 
enlightening—all at the same time. It also has the power to transform your life.
JONATHAN D. MORENO, University of Pennsylvania Professor of Ethics, 
author of Impromptu Man
The profound impact of Werner Erhard’s work on culture and society is a
manifestation of an incredible insight, the experience of being, presented in 
this book through a comparative analysis of a transcript of a 1989 Forum led by 
Erhard alongside Heidegger’s reflections on the meaning of “being there.” The
authors have drawn amazing parallels between these two extraordinary thinkers 
and have demonstrated the intersections of Heidegger’s language with Erhard’s 
ontological rhetoric of transformation. Erhard has at times described aspects of his 
method as ruthless compassion, and like all forms of compassion, evident here is a
fundamental motivating desire to alleviate the suff ering of others. 
JAMES R. DOTY, MD, Founder and Director, The Center for Compassion and Altruism
Research and Education, Professor of Neurosurgery, Stanford University School of 
Medicine, and Senior Editor of  The Oxford Handbook of Compassion Science
Speaking Being is not a book. It is a multimodal tour de force of ontological rhetoric
that hails its reader into an event and in so doing performs as an event, rather 
than what is commonly rendered as a book between two covers. Its status as an 
event is performed on every page wherein the “showing” of Being is enacted via 
its remarkable design. Kaleidoscopically, Bruce Hyde and Drew Kopp have drawn 
their readers into a dazzling display, where the participants in dialogue with Werner 
Erhard in a specific Forum in 1989 are put into dialogue with Martin Heidegger. The 
result is arguably one of the most astounding academic interventions into both 
Erhard’s methodology and Heideggerian thought. Citing David Farrell Krell, Hyde 
and Kopp remind us that “to be on a woodpath means to be in a cul-de-sac, a path
that leads nowhere and has no exit.” Speaking Being puts its readers in a dizzying 
cul-de-sac within which they may never leave, but rather transform into one of the
glittering particles of this rhetorical kaleidoscope. 
CYNTHIA HAYNES, Professor of English, Clemson University, author of  The Homesick 
Phone Book: Addressing Rhetoric in the Age of Perpetual Conflict
Theory and Practice: Ways of seeing what one claims to be the truth of some
intended object of consciousness and ways of applying this truth to one’s 
everyday existence in order to cultivate wisdom, goodness, self-realization, and 
justice. The dialogical teachings of Werner Erhard speak to the importance of this 
relationship and its ontological significance. Professors Hyde and Kopp, scholars 
of rhetoric and communication who had observed and participated in programs 
designed by Erhard, provide comprehensive and detailed conversations—what 
they term “ontological rhetoric”—that took place in Erhard’s 1989 Forum, and they 
demonstrate how Erhard and Heidegger can be read together for the benefit of 
both. This book is a major achievement in the scholarship of Erhard and Heidegger 
studies. A much-needed moment of enlightenment.
MICHAEL J. HYDE, University Distinguished Professor of Communication Ethics, Wake 
Forest University, author of Perfection: Coming to Terms with Being Human
In Speaking Being the reader discovers two original thinkers—Werner Erhard 
and Martin Heidegger—two intellects who independently reached linguistic, 
ontological, and phenomenological philosophies that illuminate each other.

Authors Hyde and Kopp accomplish the formidable task of masterfully presenting 
Erhard and Heidegger side by side in a readable, lively, and illuminating text. There 
is nothing quite like it!
JERONIMA (JERI) ECHEVERRIA, Professor of History and Provost Emerita, California 
State University at Fresno, former Executive Vice-Chancellor for Academic Aff airs of 
the California State University System
Educational research confirms that without a significant intervention, students 
who become teachers are likely to replicate the pedagogical approaches their 
teachers used with them. Practicing Erhard’s approach to ontological inquiry—
presented in print for the first time in this book—provides such an intervention. 
It equips students, teachers, academics of any field to critically examine their 
dispositions and access more eff ective ways of being and acting. Speaking Being is
a must read for scholars of social foundations of education, teacher education, and
frankly, for members of any field of study.
CAROLYNE J. WHITE, Professor of Social Foundations, Department of Urban 
Education, Rutgers University Newark
A diff erent you and a diff erent me must show up each day if we are going to
tackle the world’s most vexing problems. This book talks us through a process of 
transformation by showing us what it means to be an authentic human being in an
inauthentic world, and what it means to take a stand for a world where everyone
matters and where everyone can make a diff erence. 
WILEY “CHIP” SOUBA, MD, SCD, MBA, Professor of Surgery, Geisel School 
of Medicine at Dartmouth, former Dean of Medicine and VP for Health Aff airs,
Dartmouth College
This engaging study of Erhard’s counter-discursive approach to transformational 
education—and how this approach aligns significantly with Heidegger’s thinking—
might serve as a starting point for a deeper Indigenous philosophy. Rooted in a
more non-hierarchical epistemology, such an Indigenous philosophy promises to
move us away from a colonized and deeply problematized way of thinking, toward 
embracing the power and mysteriousness of presence, and making possible a
place-based, non-anthropocentric interconnectedness. This is the next essential 
step we must take if we are to survive as a species.
FOUR ARROWS, AKA DON TRENT JACOBS, PHD, EdD, editor of Unlearning the
Language of Conquest, author of Point of Departure
f
and Teaching Truly

While some readers of Speaking Being may be familiar with The Landmark Forum, 
most don’t know its connections to the philosophical tradition. Hyde and Kopp 
have woven together concise explanations of Heidegger’s notoriously diff icult 
thinking with an actual transcript of Erhard’s Forum—by turns moving, funny, and 
shocking. This juxtaposition draws the reader into the experience and powerfully
illuminates the teachings of these two thinkers.
DAVID STOREY, Associate Professor, Boston College, author of 
Naturalizing Heidegger
Speaking Being presents an ontological play between Erhard, Heidegger, the 
participants of a Forum delivered in 1989, and the reader, who is summoned to 
the scene to dwell in compelling questions and distinctions, the living of which
make available the invention of a life that is experienced as authentic. The
relentless commitment of authors Hyde and Kopp to communicate the unsayable, 
Being, opens up new directions for a rhetoric of emancipation that goes beyond 
traditional critical theories. Speaking Being speaks a new relation to language, one
that honors the unexplored ontological power of language to create a new freedom 
to be, to live with existential courage.

Many academics in cultural studies accept postmodernity and content pedagogy 
as unquestionable facts of the world, but with a paltry understanding of how these 
ideas undermine our intention to produce morally conscious, action-oriented 
citizens. In their lucid exposition of Werner Erhard’s methodology, Hyde and Kopp 
off er a cogent roadmap out of such a paralyzing paradigm of knowledge and 
subjectivity. Brilliantly, the authors use Martin Heidegger’s writing to illuminate
Erhard’s work and The Forum’s compelling impact on participants. Readers will
discover for themselves, based on the contexts they bring, a powerful pedagogy
of transformation grounded in an ontological inquiry into human being that 
leads students to discover their own paths of social agency and initiative. Highly 
recommended!
TRYSTAN T. COTTEN, Associate Professor, Gender Studies, University of California,
Stanislaus, founder and managing editor of Transgress Press
Speaking Being presents, perhaps for the first time, a complete transcript of an 
actual Forum led by Werner Erhard, allowing the reader to directly observe and 
experience the unique power of dialogue as a tool for human transformation. 
Furthermore, authors Hyde and Kopp provide an intellectually satisfying
correlation between the philosophical ideas of Martin Heidegger and the out-here-
in-the-world work of Werner Erhard, revealing their surprising complementarity. I
d
congratulate the authors on achieving this tour de force.

Introduction
1
 Introduction
In 1971, the television debut of All in the Family tickled an American public who
y
was also celebrating the successful moon landing, and safe return home, of two
Apollo space missions. In the same year, much smaller audiences took note of Igor 
Stravinsky’s death and the birth of Calvin Broadus Jr. (aka Snoop Dogg/Lion); a 
marketing phenomenon was born in Seattle with the opening of the first Star-
bucks; Idi Amin ousted Milton Obote to become the dictator of Uganda; and in the
new academic field of composition and rhetoric, a movement to elevate the status 
of process began to stir. Meanwhile, in October of that year in a meeting room of 
San Francisco’s less-than-swank Jack Tar Hotel, Werner Erhard assembled some
two hundred participants for the debut of the est Training. Given this timing for 
the emergence of the est Training, media at the time characterized it as a part of 
t
the human potential movement, but scholar Jonathan Moreno has more recently 
called est “the most important cultural event after the human potential movement
itself seemed exhausted” (Impromptu Man 247).
Infamous for its rigorous ground rules and confrontational methods—
elements Erhard says were necessary in the liberated, let-it-all-hang-out, “new 
age” ethos of the time—the est Training (Latin for
t
it is, and an acronym for Erhard 
Seminars Training) grew in popularity throughout the 1970s because of the im-
pressive benefits participants reported having received, including better relation-
ships and a greater sense of “aliveness.” Trainees experienced being “at cause” 
in the matter of their lives, and having a new sense that their lives could make a
difference in the world. They felt “free to be.” This new sense of responsibility and 
freedom allowed for breakthroughs in communicating with others, and enabled
them to produce results, both personal and professional, that they would previ-
ously have seen as unlikely.
At the source of this educational enterprise was an experience Erhard had 
undergone earlier that year, although he later said it was “not in itself so much an 
experience, as a shift in the context in which he held all process, including experi-
ence” (Bartley 168). In some traditions, such an event might be referred to as an
individual’s having undergone enlightenment; Erhard has called it a transformation.
He was, at this point in his life, a highly successful sales manager and trainer for a 
large publishing company. Further, he had devoted much of the previous decade to 
the rigorous exploration of various systems of enlightenment and personal devel-
opment, from Zen (the essential one, he says) to the Dale Carnegie course and Mind
Dynamics. But one morning in 1971, as he was driving across the Golden Gate Bridge
en route to his office, he suddenly realized that he knew nothing. As he related the
incident to his biographer, William Bartley:
All the things I had ever heard, and read, and all those hours 
of practice, suddenly fell into place. It was so stupidly,
blindingly simple that I could not believe it. I saw that there
were no hidden meanings, that everything was just the 
way that it is, and that I was already all right. . . . I realized 
that I was not my emotions or thoughts. I was not my 
ideas, my intellect, my perceptions, my beliefs. . . . I was 
simply the space, the creator, the source of all that stuff. I
experienced Self as Self in a direct, unmediated way. I didn’t 
just experience Self; I became Self. Suddenly I held all the 
information, the content, in my life in a new way, from a new
mode, a new context. . . .  I am I am. (Bartley 167–168)
In other words, an experience of being. The insight Erhard derived from that ex-
perience subsequently became what thousands of est trainees would spend two
t
weekends and several hundred dollars to “get” for themselves. 
Discussing his work later, Erhard addressed the challenge he had confronted in
attempting to communicate what seemed essentially incommunicable: “You can’t
do this in the ordinary sense of communication: I can’t have it and give it to you. But
I can communicate in a way so that you get an opportunity to realize that you have 
it yourself already. Essentially, this is what the est Training was developed to do. It
t
provides a setting in which this kind of sharing takes place” (Bartley 169).
From the outset, the language of est was central to both its pedagogical process 
and its public image. A fundamental tenet of the est Training, as well as its succes-
t
sor program, The Forum, has been that transformation lives in language, and that 
participants keep the program’s results available in their lives by communicating 
those results with others. At the same time, Erhard’s enterprise has consistently 
eschewed traditional advertising. The only way people have become aware of his 
work has been through hearing about it from their friends, family, or associates. 
The resulting symbiotic relationship—the program survives only when participants 
communicate about it with family and friends, and it is through communicating
about it that participants keep the benefits alive in their experience—has served the 
work well through four decades. By 1985, when the est Training was discontinued
t
and replaced by The Forum, word-of-mouth had brought a half-million people to see
for themselves what this transformation was all about. As of 2019, another 2 million

Forum (www.landmarkworldwide.com).1
Erhard’s influence on the culture has made itself felt in another way as well. 
During the 1970s, when it sometimes seemed that every fifth person in San Francis-
co was an est graduate, you could generally detect that element of the population
t
by their use of the program’s language, which in casual use began to be heard as
jargon. Erhard’s use of this terminology, however, was highly purposive, and many
of those words and phrases made their way into the public sphere, some to last-
ing effect. An example has been the shift in the popular understanding of the term 
sharing. Before est, people shared a cookie or a bench in the park; what was shared
was divided, and in the process one’s own share was inevitably diminished. But
in the est Training, 
g participants shared their experience, and through sharing, that 
experience was augmented. To share, in the world of est, was to communicate in
such a way that one’s self and not merely one’s story was made available, leaving the
f
other touched rather than merely informed. This meaning of the word, we assert, is 
now common in our culture. Likewise, the term coaching, borrowed by Erhard from
the sports arena in the early eighties to identify the style of his pedagogy, has since
become ubiquitous in the field of management, human resources, and executive 
coaching. And the ubiquitous Mastercard catchphrase, “Master the possibilities,”
was born in the mind of an est graduate for whom the term
t
possibility had acquired
a new level of meaning; however, through overuse in the media, this new level of 
meaning has diminished.
The move to discontinue the Training in 1985 and replace it with The Forum 
arose from Erhard’s perception of a shift in the culture’s way of responding to the 
Training; he wanted to design a course that was responsive to that shift. At this 
point, while Erhard’s success during those years had been greeted by considerable 
media curiosity, scholarly interest was moderate. Several studies of the est Training
t
attempted to measure its effects using a psychological model; while he considered
such efforts valuable, Erhard has asserted that this approach is inappropriate for 
analysis of his work. His work, he says, is not psychological but ontological: his 
concern is the being of human beings (“Heart of the Matter” 1984). He has also 
consistently emphasized that the focus of his work is the development of the lan-
guage in which it is articulated. Yet no significant scholarly work dealing either with
Erhard’s language use, or with the nature of an ontological methodology, has been 
published, even in the academic fields most likely to be deeply concerned with
such matters—rhetoric and writing studies, business management, philosophy, and 
communication studies. This book aims to begin to correct that omission.
Before proceeding, we offer this statement of authorial stance: The authors
have engaged extensively, both as participants and as scholars, in numerous pro-
grams designed by Werner Erhard. The senior author took the est Training for the
t
first time in 1973, and we have each participated a number of times in The Forum, 
both during Erhard’s tenure in the organization and following his departure. Our 
doctoral dissertations (University of Southern California, 1990; University of Arizona,
2008) consisted of rhetorical and philosophical analyses of The Forum. Based upon
this considerable study and experience, our assessment of Erhard’s work is un-
equivocal: we have found this work to be pedagogically effective and intellectually 
significant in all of its historical iterations. Our intention in this book is to stimulate
its serious consideration by the academic community, as well as by others in the
culture at large.
It is also important to note that our approach as participant observers has
its limits. To carry out the design of the book, we have precluded a number of 
approaches that readers may wish to see addressed, and we beg those readers to 
indulge us. Before any significant and critical treatments could be viable, or even 
possible, from a number of disciplines—including philosophy, communication stud-
ies, rhetorical criticism, and so on—the phenomenon must be first made available. 
We present this book as a way into the phenomenon in question, and consequently,
we invite members from a range of academic disciplines to enter the conversation
we are seeking to initiate.
Evolution 
This is an historical document. It presents an account of one moment—albeit a sig-
nificant one—in an ongoing project for the development of human being. The first 
iteration of this project, the est Training, was designed to communicate to people
t
living in the cultural environment of the 1970s. As Erhard saw it, considerable logis-
tical rigor was required for the course to achieve its purpose, and thus the format
included demands for which est soon became notorious, including lengthy sessions
t
1 Landmark describes The Landmark Forum as a personal and professional development program,
based on the discipline of applied ontology and phenomenology. Erhard created the work in the
early 1970s and continued its development until in 1991 Landmark took over its ongoing devel-
opment as expressed in The Landmark Forum and other Landmark programs. As of the writing of 
this book, the material and structure of The Forum have continued to be developed during three 
decades since the 1989 Forum presented in this book. The Landmark Forum of today (circa 2019) 
is less time (three days and an evening and each day ends by 10:00 pm), it incorporates the use of 
PowerPoint displays and videos that enhance the participants’ experience of and access to what is
being presented, and there is no use of profanity on the part of the program leaders.

with limited bathroom breaks, a highly confrontational interaction style—with
the use of expletives—and the surrender of all wristwatches at the door. These
demands were modified when The Forum replaced the Training; and in subsequent 
years, as the communication paradigm of the culture has continued to shift, the 
delivery of The Forum has altered accordingly.
On the one hand, of course, The Forum conversation inevitably challenges 
participants’ familiar way of seeing things. Ontological inquiry—pedagogy such as 
The Forum, that aims to get beyond mere conceptual knowledge—is of necessity 
rigorous and sometimes uncomfortable. In Martin Heidegger’s words, authentic in-
quiry into Being always “has the character of doing violence, whether to the claims 
of the everyday interpretation, or to its complacency and tranquillized obviousness”
(BT 359). But while the conversation in the current Landmark Forum remains rigor-
T
ous, participants will find a presentation that can for the most part be described as 
gentler, and more user-friendly, than the one presented in this book. 
A further aspect of this difference, of course, has to do with Werner Erhard’s
personal style. In his delivery of both the Training and The Forum, Erhard’s com-
munication was edgily playful and relentlessly purposive. He called his approach
ruthless compassion; and it included a profound sense of humor and Socratic 
irony implicit in the human condition. To communicate the humor as well as the 
compassion, he often provoked and insulted participants, using language gener-
ally considered inappropriate for such a setting (in a parody of one of his favorite 
epithets, graduates of the Training were sometimes referred to as “estholes”). Yet, as 
this book shows, those participants who initially resisted these intrusions inevitably
got the message. Erhard has related this confrontive aspect of his communication
to his 1971 experience of transformation: “On the bridge,” he said, “all of a sudden I 
could be 100% responsible for everything in my life, and at the same time none of it 
had any significance. At that point you are free and fearless” (Erhard, interview with 
authors). Erhard’s communication style, and his humor, remain on full display in this 
book; the authors see them as important and entertaining aspects of the historical 
account we are presenting here.
Erhard Encounters Heidegger
Despite the shift we have cited here in The Forum’s style and tone, a central thesis
of this book is that from the first offering of the est Training in 1971, through its
t
replacement by the Forum in 1985 and its current iteration as the Landmark Forum, 
the process at the heart of this pedagogy has retained its transformational
dynamic. This dynamic, as we will show, arises in the unspoken ontological realm
of The Forum conversation as it proceeds, and has been the essential element of the 
course through all of its terminological variations. 
During the transition to The Forum, Erhard excised many of the est Training’s 
t
more meditative exercises and incorporated into the course a new vocabulary and
redesigned procedures, with the stated intention that participants would have an 
enhanced experience of creating a new realm of possibility for themselves and their 
y
lives. At about this time, through colleagues, he was introduced to the work of the
twentieth-century German philosopher Martin Heidegger. Erhard was taken with the 
way Heidegger’s thinking reverberated with his own, and he consulted with several 
Heideggerian scholars on the subject. Two of them—Hubert Dreyfus of University of 
California, Berkeley and Michael E. Zimmerman of Tulane—provided formal assess-
ments of the est Training’s effectiveness, and noted its consistencies with elements 
t
of Heidegger’s thought. When Erhard’s revised technology emerged in The Forum
and other redesigned courses, significant Heideggerian terminology was included 
in its rhetorical mix, and Erhard occasionally read passages from Heidegger in his
presentations.
Most significantly, Erhard saw that Heidegger’s ideas and his own were commu-
nicating from the same unspoken realm, and that the specifications of the two vo-
cabularies could be merged to communicate that realm more powerfully: “I learned
from Heidegger,” said Erhard, “nuances of what I had been saying that clarified and
made more potent what was there” (Erhard, interview with authors). 
What was there was Erhard’s technology of language for the communication of 
being, and its ability, in both the Training and The Forum, to consistently and pow-
erfully evoke an experience that participants found transformative. The evocation
of that experience has remained The Forum’s essential element; Erhard’s encounter 
with Heidegger enriched the vocabulary in which he could see into it more pro-
foundly and communicate it more effectively. 
Technology
The form of this study will be comparative analysis: we will demonstrate that the 
work of Werner Erhard is aligned in significant ways with the philosophy of Martin
Heidegger, and that a comparison of their work illuminates the thinking of both
men. We will show that The Forum’s dialogic form introduces a performative dimen-
sion of Heidegger’s ontological vocabulary in a way that Heidegger himself, working 
within a restrictive academic and political culture, was unable to do. We propose 
that The Forum conversation is ontological rhetoric: purposive speaking that com-
municates and makes present a context of meaning that, if left unexamined, shapes

SPEAKING BEING
thesis is that the work of Werner Erhard makes available the ontological domain of 
language, so that the decentering of subjectivity and the reinvention of the self can
be experienced as possibilities rather than merely considered as theory. 
We recognize that this pedagogical model is in many ways a radical one, given
the strength of the assumptions embedded in our tradition; but Heidegger says that 
an experience with language in the ontological domain always requires “a leap.” 
As our educational institutions struggle increasingly to generate an opening for the
human in the face of the advance of the technological, we argue that the situation is
critical, and that a leap of this kind is in order.
The Plan of the Book
The central text for this book, located in the left and right columns on either page, 
is the combination of two sources: notes taken by the senior author while observing
a Forum in San Francisco led by Werner Erhard in December 1989, and a transcrip-
tion of the video of the same four-day event made available to the junior author on 
location at Landmark Worldwide’s archives. While the transcript provides compre-
hensive and detailed conversations of the actual 1989 Forum, there are important
alterations that must be accounted for. First and foremost, all names have been 
altered except for Werner Erhard, and actual names have been used only for those 
participants who speak more than once or twice with Erhard or the other two indi-
viduals leading the course (“Kipp” and “Wes”). In addition, some conversations have 
been edited out, or summarized, for the sake of space. For instance, all discussions 
dealing with the Six-Day Course, discontinued in 1990, have been removed. Also
missing from the transcript is the Evening Session of the 1989 Forum: there was 
no extant video recording of that event. However, that omission can be rectified 
for interested readers if they were to attend an evening session of The Landmark
Forum, where participants will share their experience of the course for guests they
themselves have invited.
We call the text that accompanies the transcript either “sidebars” or “intervals.” 
Sidebars occur in the central columns between the far left and right panes that 
house the transcript of The Forum, and the intervals occur between sessions of the
course, and at the conclusion of each of the four days. In the sidebars and intervals 
are relevant ideas from the thinking of Martin Heidegger. Sometimes the connection 
between a sidebar and the transcript it accompanies may be apparent; sometimes 
it may be intended obliquely, as a hint at the background. Intervals are more often
oblique in this way due to the focus on Heidegger’s thinking in its wider arcs, for 
and limits our way of being. However, this context of meaning cannot be spoken
directly. It becomes present by virtue of what is said.
The dynamic of Erhard’s technology of language responds directly to issues 
raised by Heidegger in his 1954 essay, “The Question Concerning Technology” (Basic 
Writings). Technology’s essence, proposes Heidegger, is its relentless demand that
all of nature, including human beings, be placed in standing reserve, on call for the
uses of technology itself.  The way of being evoked by this development (i.e., that we 
ourselves function as “calculable material” in a cybernetic system designed to serve 
ourselves) poses the danger that we may become lost in the profound reflexivity of 
that system, and, most fatally, may forget that anything has been lost. Surrender to 
technology “threatens man with the possibility that it could be denied to him to en-
ter into a more original revealing and hence to experience the call of a more primal 
truth” (“QCT” in BW 333). Such surrender, however, seems inevitable: the technolog-
W
ical epoch is where we have landed, the only way of being we have been provided, 
and resistance is as futile as surrender is fatal. 
But Heidegger suggests a middle path, a “comportment toward technology
which expresses ‘yes’ and at the same time ‘no’” (DT 54). Further, he proposes that
T
“essential reflection upon technology and decisive confrontation with it must hap-
pen in a realm that is, on the one hand, akin to the essence of technology, and, on 
the other, fundamentally different from it”(“QCT” in BW 340). We suggest that Wer-
W
ner Erhard’s work provides such a realm. It is both a manifestation of the technolog-
ical epoch and a subversive appropriation of its impulse, a thinking which reaches
beyond the technological paradigm by reaching through that paradigm.
In Academia
 For half a century, postmodern and poststructuralist theories across many disci-
plines have theorized a new freedom from the constraints of the Cartesian model
of human being. Human subjectivity has been decentered; the self is no longer 
understood as the fixed and self-certain cogito but is open to creative reinvention;
language does not merely re-present a preexisting world of objective meanings, but
in fact generates the meanings that constitute that world. 
These theoretical assertions concern being. But their effective communication
in the universities has been hindered by our epistemologically-based academic
tradition, which assumes that the central dynamic of education is knowing. This has 
given rise to a pedagogical model in which the ontological domain must always re-
main merely conceptual, because being is not apprehended by knowing. The book’s

ing group. To the group, composed of Allan Cohen, Joe DiMaggio, Bruce Gregory, 
Michael C. Jensen, Sigurfreyr Jonasson, David C. Logan, Nicholas Merton, Daniel 
Rogerson, Steve Zaffron, and Michael E. Zimmerman—we want you to know our im-
measurable joy when we received feedback that could only come from the deepest
appreciation. For granting access to Landmark Worldwide’s archives to allow for the 
production of an accurate and complete transcript, we thank Harry Rosenberg, Mick
Leavitt and Landmark Worldwide staff. To the Wiley team, including Shannon Vargo,
Sally Baker, Peter Knox, Deborah Schindlar, and Jocelyn Kwiatkowski: thank you for 
taking a risk on this project—given its untraditional scope, design, and size—and
for taking such great care throughout all stages of bringing this book into the world.
To Lou Agosta, Jeff Bineham, Richard Doyle, Charles Guignon, Michael J. Hyde,
and Carolyne White—together with the members of Lecole book club—thank you
for reviewing and responding to the early versions of the manuscript; we hope your 
thoughtful attention presages serious study of this rich rhetorical phenomenon 
within such academic fields as rhetoric and writing studies, education, philosophy,
and communication studies.
Last, Bruce and I together stand in ovation to the man who has made, and will
continue to make, the difference for both of us and countless others—the difference
for all those who have had the opportunity, the gift, to be and speak with him—for 
in the very act of speaking being we create possibility for ourselves and our lives. 
Werner Erhard: Thank you for providing a way to say what otherwise remains 
forever unsayable.
instance, the central theme of “the forgetting of Being,” which has eight parts.
Our purpose in this book is not to explain The Forum, or Heidegger’s philosophy—
although there are moments where we do provide analysis—but rather, we primarily
aim to engage the reader in thinking Erhard’s and Heidegger’s ideas for themselves.
For readers who have previously participated in The Forum, we believe the con-
fluence here of Heidegger’s thinking with Erhard’s will enrich the way those readers
hold their Forum experience.  This has been true for the authors, and it is likewise
consistent with the experience of Werner Erhard, for whom exposure to Heidegger’s 
thinking provided profound insights (Erhard, interview with authors). We intend that 
this book, in a dialogue with its readers, will evoke such insights.  
Martin Heidegger once cautioned his students not to focus too closely on the
concepts in his lectures, but rather to follow the “movement of showing” (OTB 2).
The Forum conversation, we assert, is a carefully designed movement in language 
for the showing of being. In this book, we will show that showing. Our goal—Heide-
gger’s, Erhard’s, the authors’—is the unconcealment of a powerful aspect of human
being with which we are, for the most part, unfamiliar.
While it may go without saying, reading this book will not provide an experience
of The Forum. We intend to hint at that experience, and we encourage readers for 
whom our hints are provocative to seek out the experience for themselves. The Forum
occurs essentially as a dialogue; ontological inquiry demands interactive play, and 
needs “the widest sphere in which to swing” (“DL” in OWL 27). In written form, Heideg-
ger warned, “the movement of the questioning that is called for here might too easily 
congeal” (“DL” in OWL 50). 
Nonetheless, as we undertake this project, the authors stand in the open ques-
tion: What is the possibility of communicating being? This is not a questioning that
seeks an answer; rather, the inquiry it generates persistently reflects the question 
itself back upon the questioner, undermining comforting and limiting assumptions.
Thus we see it as a transformational question. We invite the reader to join us in this 
inquiry.
Acknowledgments
It is impossible to list all those who have contributed significantly to the composi-
tion of this book; to do so with full integrity would mean naming all who have risked 
what it means to hear the unsaid in what is said. In particular, our gratitude goes
to several extraordinary individuals without whom our work would have failed to
move beyond the planning stages, including first, Barbara Stevenson and Sheryl

Forum Day One: Session One 
7
 PRELUDE
More than 700 people were assembled in the ballroom of the Hyatt Regency Hotel in San 
Francisco on the morning of December 27th, 1989. This was the first day of The Forum, and the 
occasion was unique in several ways. The first was that this Forum was to be led by Werner 
Erhard himself. Although he had created the technology of language that constituted The
Forum, since 1973, to accommodate growing demand for the program across the United States 
and in Europe, the course had increasingly been led by members of a growing body of est
Trainers, and later Forum leaders, a group of men and women trained by Erhard. As of 1989 
there were forty-three Forum leaders, ten women and thirty-three men.
A second unique aspect of this four-day event was that it was an exceptionally large Forum
composed of various groups in addition to the 502 regular participants (the usual number
ranged from 100 to 250). Forty Forum leaders were also present as part of their training; during 
breaks in the procedure, they met with Erhard for debriefing sessions that the senior author 
attended as part of a special program for Forum graduates called Openings, a group of approx-
imately 100 participants who were permitted to observe without actively participating. Also 
in the room were a number of invited observers who occupied a visitors’ gallery and whose
number varied during the course of The Forum. Last, a large contingent of staff and assistants
(volunteers) performed logistical duties throughout the four days. 
Due to the efforts of the assistants, the ballroom set-up remained consistent across all 
sessions of each of the four days. Regular participants and Forum leaders were seated in rows,
theater-style, before a raised platform which stretched across most of the width of the room, 
and included a runway section extending well into the center of the audience area. Arranged
on the platform were three chalkboards, two bar-height director’s chairs, a music stand, and
a large table which held a water pitcher and glasses, tissues, and writing materials. Openings 
participants and other observers were seated on risers at the rear of the room. Also at the rear
of the room was an enclosed translators’ booth: among the participants in Openings were 
twenty-five observers from Japan, seminar leaders and staff members in the Tokyo office of 
Werner Erhard and Associates. They listened to the proceedings in simultaneous translation 
through earphones connected to the translators’ booth. Finally, three television cameras were
placed strategically around the room to record the event, and several television monitors were 
placed so that most participants could watch the proceedings on video if they chose.
THE FORUM BEGINS
At 9:00 am, unannounced, Werner Erhard walked onto the platform. His manner was relaxed 
and casual. He wore dark tan slacks, a white shirt open at the collar, and an olive sweater 
vest. He greeted the participants in a friendly way, welcomed guests, and asked for questions 
while late arrivals were completing their paperwork. He asked if there was anything about the
television cameras that needed clearing up, and he explained the presence of the Openings
participants and the observers seated in the Gallery. Someone asked about the people wearing
earphones, and he explained about the translators and participants from Japan. “That’s a good 
question,” he said. “Questions like that . . . what about, what if?”
Participants who raised their hands were asked to stand and wait until they were given a 
microphone; an assistant was stationed on each aisle to deliver one. After Erhard responded

SPEAKING BEING
Talking about Being
One of the similarities between the work of Werner Erhard and
Martin Heidegger is that both are designing a language for a 
specific purpose: the evocation of Being. Since the debut of The 
Forum in 1985, Erhard has regularly incorporated Heideggerian 
terminology into his vocabulary, and has quoted Heidegger 
extensively in his courses. It is the primary thesis of this book that 
Erhard’s work is aligned in significant ways with the philosophy of 
Martin Heidegger. Even the est Training, the beginnings of which
t
predate Erhard’s encounter with Heidegger (circa 1980), already
was aligned in significant ways with Heidegger’s thinking. This
alignment allowed Erhard to creatively incorporate Heideggerian
language in the delivery of what would become The Forum.
Heidegger’s language, on first encounter, is notoriously 
difficult; he regularly invented new German terms for his ideas,
and translators have struggled to capture his meanings. Erhard
likewise uses words in unconventional ways, and calls his work
a “technology of language” in recognition of that fact. It is the
experience of the authors that a comparative inquiry into the two 
bodies of work illuminates the thinking of both men, and helps
to clarify the linguistic complexity of Heidegger’s writing. In this 
book, we intend gradually to unconceal (a Heideggerian term 
l
Erhard has used) that clarity (IM 116). 
This is not to say that either body of thought ever reaches the
kind of logical understandability that we generally expect in what
we read and hear. “If you walk out of here understanding,” Erhard
tells The Forum participants at one point, “that’s the booby prize.” 
Both Heidegger and Erhard are attempting to communicate
something that, on that familiar level, cannot be communicated 
or grasped. This is new territory for communication, and requires 
both a new language (or, as Erhard says, new “languaging”) and a
new way of listening.
We request, therefore, that the reader join us in embracing
the atmosphere of questionability that must surround this entire
to several questions about the various colors of name tags worn by people in the room, one 
participant raised her hand. Erhard called upon her to stand, and she asked about Erhard’s use 
of language.
ERHARD
You need a language that gives you access to the kind of detail that you need to be a brain sur-
geon... The language you and I are going to use in here is also a specifi c language. It’s designed 
to let you get at something you can’t get at without that language. Surgeons generally confi ne 
that kind of speaking to the operating room, and so do I. I don’t use that language when I’m out
to dinner. For the most part it’s unseemly to use special language when you’re with people who
don’t share in that language.
Erhard asked for more questions. After he called on someone, he explained the reasons for
standing up and for calling on multiple people (“to allow time to get microphones to them”). She 
asked about logistics. Erhard said it would happen later. She sat down.
BLAKE (after receiving a microphone from an assistant)
I don’t know whether The Forum started yet, but I wanted to get through my apprehension of 
speaking before the group.
ERHARD
I suggest that those of you who have a fear of speaking take the same opportunity as Blake did. 
In The Forum no one is required to stand up and speak, though it is in your interest to do so,
especially if you are reluctant to stand and speak.
Erhard also discussed the schedule of the course, pointing out that the daily ending time would be 
sometime between 11:00 pm and 1:00 am, adding that
ERHARD
Nobody guarantees you that schedule. You want to be clear about that. We’re going to do this 
as long as it takes to get it done.
In addition, he said, The Forum would not be complete until the completion of the evening session, 
which would be held on the following Thursday evening—simultaneously in several cities, since 
many participants in this Forum had traveled to San Francisco for this event. Participants were 
encouraged to bring guests to their respective evening sessions.
As the conversation proceeded into the second hour, it gradually became clear, without transition,
that the serious business of the course had begun. A participant named Ruth rose to say that she
was pessimistic about getting the results of The Forum. Erhard began his response by acknowledg-
ing the validity of her doubt.

Forum Day One: Session One 
9
ERHARD
Very, very little in life turns out the way it was promised. So I remember my mother told me if I 
was a good boy everything would be great in life. I tried it for one day and it didn’t work. People 
are told that when they graduate life will be wonderful, life will be easy, and it didn’t turn out 
that way. When you get married it’ll be great but it doesn’t turn out that way. People say when 
you get divorced it’ll be all right but it doesn’t turn out that way. Most things don’t live up to
their promises.
RUTH
And what about the promises of The Forum?
ERHARD
Based on surveys, most people who’ve done this work say it turned out better than they expect-
ed. For you that’ll be easy, because you have a pessimistic view about how things’ll turn out. 
We’ve got your six hundred dollars. You’re not going to get it back. Given that conversation’s 
over, it’ll turn out however it turns out. You know, I’ve never been wrong about that.
(To Ruth)
I could say a lot of things to reassure you, and that would be a mistake. Your pessimism is you.
(raising his voice, he turned to the group)
Listen up! If you haven’t noticed, The Forum has begun. See, you and I think that our mood, 
our internal state, the way we are seeing things; we think that is a product of the circumstanc-
t
es. So I look at something and I like it, or I look at something and I don’t like it. I think if I 
like it, it’s the fault of the thing I’m looking at, and if I don’t like it, I think it’s the fault of the 
thing I’m looking at. That’s the kind of thing that generates in me: “like”; and that’s the kind 
of thing that generates in me: “don’t like.” You and I think that our way of being is a product of 
what’s over there. As you will see as we do The Forum together a lot of what is going on with
you and me is something we already always are. It’s something I am before anything happens. 
I’m kind of a pessimist waiting for life to happen, or I’m an optimist waiting for life to happen. 
About certain kinds of things I’m a pessimist before I even look at them, and then when I look 
at them, it’s hard for me to recognize that the pessimism isn’t generated out of the thing I’m 
looking at, but it’s something I brought with me. Kind of like I was already always pessimistic
and then this thing came along. So it’s good that you’re pessimistic, and if you’re not pessimis-
tic, that’s good too.
(to Ruth)
If you find yourself being that way, don’t try to change it. What’s good is whatever you are, 
because that’s what you want to bring into The Forum. If you deal with that pessimism
which you are in a certain way, you’ll have a choice about being pessimistic when it is ap-
propriate. Pessimism is not a bad idea, and if you didn’t have pessimism I would give it to 
you, because one of the things you’re going to find in here is that we ask you not to believe 
anything that’s said in here. We’ll talk more about that later. At any rate, the point that 
project. There is a sense in which we don’t know what we are
talking about, and the emphasis in that sentence should be placed 
on the word “know,” as implying a secure conceptual grasp. 
Talking about Being is challenging and sometimes feels, to use
the vernacular, weird. Being is both pervasive and evanescent. It 
is elusive, vanishing even as it appears. 
In his writing about Being (and all of his writing is about 
Being), Heidegger celebrates the ambiguity surrounding the topic.
This is “something which every thinker has to see afresh each 
time, else he is not a thinker: that everything that lies before us is
ambiguous” (WCT 201). However, this does not mean fuzziness at
T
the expense of rigor: 
NOTE:  Erhard believes that Heidegger’s use of the word 
“thought” leaves people misled about what Heidegger 
means in the following way: Perhaps the word “thought” is 
valid for what is written down for people to consider, but it
did not come from “thinking”—by which most people will
understand “figuring it out”—it came from something like 
“looking,” or “just being with,” and is pointed to by the word 
“wonder” (Erhard, interview with the authors).
This multiplicity of possible interpretations
does not discredit the strictness of the thought
content. For all true thought remains open 
to more than one interpretation—and this by 
reason of its nature. Nor is this multiplicity of 
possible interpretations merely the residue
of a still unachieved formal-logical univocity 
which we properly ought to strive for but did 
not attain. Rather, multiplicity of meanings is 
the element in which all thought must move in 
order to be strict thought. (WCT 71)

SPEAKING BEING
Nevertheless, despite its challenges, we assert that Being is 
also the most important thing that one could talk about, since 
talk that evokes Being has the ability to transform talk about 
everything else.
A fundamental difference in this arena is the distinction
between ontological and 
l
ontic inquiry. Ontological inquiry is 
concerned primarily with Being. Therefore all of Heidegger’s
writing, and all of the dialogue of The Forum, is ontological in 
nature. Ontic inquiry is concerned with beings, and with facts 
about them. Therefore all of our everyday conversations—
everything from political discourse to casual social chat—may be
seen as ontic. 
This is not to dismiss ontic inquiry as unimportant, or to 
equate a discussion of religion or physics with coffeeshop banter. 
We are not claiming that ontological inquiry is better, but that 
it is essentially different. And in the experience of the authors, 
it is profoundly interesting because of its transformational 
possibilities. In this book, we will illuminate the nature of 
ontological inquiry.
A prefatory note: people who write about Heidegger’s 
work differ as to whether the term Being should be capitalized.
This is, of course, a choice for translators and not one that 
confronted Heidegger, since in German all nouns are capitalized. 
It is a problematic choice because capitalization tends to reify 
or even deify, suggesting to some scholars that Being is “an 
eternal metaphysical foundation or eternal principle,” while 
for Heidegger it was “the event in which an entity reveals or 
t
shows itself” (Michael E. Zimmerman, Heidegger’s Confrontation 
with Modernity: Technology, Politics, Art xxii). Others feel that
t
capitalization is important so that what it means to exist (Being)
is not confused with the entities that exist (beings) (Richard Polt
Heidegger: An Introduction 3). 
In print, Erhard himself did not capitalize the term: a 1985 
Forum brochure states that the purpose of The Forum is to 
provide participants with “direct access to the domain of being 
itself.” In his more recent work, such as documents outlining 
I want to make now is that whatever it is that you’re feeling, or whatever it is that you’re
thinking, or whatever your mental state is, or whatever your perception is, the way you are
viewing things—that’s exactly the way it ought to be. I’m going to probably have to say that 
to you ten times, because you won’t remember that.
(to the group)
Another way you already always are is stupid about yourself. If that sounded a little bit like an
insult, you got it right. You may not be able to see that about yourself, but you’ll be able to see it
about others. As I said: not you, but other people.
(laughter)
There are ways of being with yourself that are disempowering and disenabling. You lose power 
and you lose ability. Whatever way you fi nd yourself now, and whatever ways you fi nd yourself 
variously throughout The Forum or in the evenings, or on the breaks: that’s the way you’re sup-
posed to be—whatever way that is. One way to disempower or disenable yourself is to question
whether you are being the right way... You’ll get a lot more out of The Forum a lot faster if you 
let yourself be the way you are.
(pausing)
There’s a lot of this you’re not going to get. Some of it won’t make any sense. You’re not going 
to get the whole Forum. The questions we’re asking in here are too powerful to get it all. The 
Forum leaders are still getting it. So am I. But there are parts when you need to get it. In those
parts, put up your hand if you don’t. There will be a lot of repetition in here, too. For the fourth
time: you should be the way you are! However you feel, that’s the way it ought to be. The way 
I know that is, that’s the way it is... The only right way to do The Forum is to be the way you’re 
being. If you say you shouldn’t be pessimistic, you’re getting in your way.
A participant complained that she was distracted by and resentful about the physical set-up for this 
Forum—the cameras, the observers, etc.
ERHARD
What you want to get out of that is that life is upsetting because it isn’t the way you expected it 
to be. The Forum will be that way also. What you want to get out of that is that you’re already 
upset. You’re already always upset at any change, at anything that violates your expectations. 
You think you’re not upset until something violates your expectations. I said this strange thing:
you are already always upset. You live upset. I know you don’t believe that and I’m not asking 
you to. You’re an upset waiting to happen. You’ll see that more clearly as we proceed.
LYNETTE
I’m often upset.
ERHARD
You’re always upset, and sometimes you notice it.

Forum Day One: Session One

LYNETTE
Do you have any more advice about how to get the most out of this?
ERHARD
I do and we’ll go over that this morning.
TRENT
I hear there are Forum leaders here.
ERHARD
Forum leaders are here as part of their job.
TRENT
Four consecutive days instead of two weekends?
ERHARD
We’ve done this using odd schedules in diff erent settings, for instance, in  prisons.
BLAKE (who expressed reservations about speaking)
Continuing what you were saying as far as upset is concerned, and always being with you. My 
barrier is the fear of revealing who I am. I should accept that.
ERHARD
Whatever you think is in the way, especially those things you think are part of the circum-
stances—for instance, you don’t get along with your boss and it’s quite clear to you that’s 
because you work for a jerk—bring that in here. Blake is clear that it’s something he carries
around with him; it doesn’t come out of the circumstances. That’s easy. It’s the stuff  you think
is a product of the circumstances. So if there are circumstances in here, for instance, because
there are people observing—that sounds like it is a product of the circumstances.
CHRISSY
You talked about being in The Forum whatever way you are being. What about outside
The Forum?
ERHARD
Let yourself be like you are in those parts of The Forum that are outside The Forum, for
homework assignments during the breaks, etc. If that’s your mood at the moment, don’t try to
change it. You want it there because if it isn’t there it’s not going to get dealt with—particularly 
those things you think are part of the circumstances: bring that in here. Most of what you do
outside The Forum in the next four days is going to be inside The Forum. If you do something 
to avoid that, then you’ve successfully avoided that once more. See, there’s a lot of this you’re
his development of an ontological/phenomenological model of 
leadership (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/ cf_dev/ AbsByAuth.
cfm?per_id=433651), he continues to employ the lowercase. 
In this book, we will employ capitalization in those instances 
where it clarifies the word’s meaning in a specific sentence. 
We raise the point here to emphasize the unique nature of the
issues that arise in any discussion, oral or written, of this subject. 
Being/being, as an ontological phenomenon, defies grammatical
categorization. ■
NOTE:  As of 2019, Landmark Worldwide’s Forum leader

SPEAKING BEING
not going to like. You’re sitting there now with a whole bunch of assessments and conclusions.
We’ve done this a lot. I can even tell you what your assessments and conclusions are.
A participant asked whether, based on all of this, he should keep his specifi c issues and concerns
foremost in his mind.
ERHARD
You don’t need to have something you’re kind of holding in place. We will hook what’s there
in you that’s appropriate to be hooked and pull it up to the surface. So you can kind of relax 
about that. A lot of stuff  you won’t even think about will get handled in here.
Another participant asked about the history of the organization.
ERHARD
We’ve been doing this work since 1971 and it was at the end of 1984 that we fi nished a four-
year process of developing The Forum, and we’ve been off ering The Forum since 1985 all over 
this country, and in lots of other countries around the world.
At this point, a man named Jake rose to complain about the purpose of the evening session, to
which participants had been encouraged to invite guests.
JAKE
Isn’t that more for Werner Erhard and Associates to hustle more members?
ERHARD
You know that you are a hustle waiting to happen, right?
JAKE
I said I feel like I’m being hustled.
ERHARD
I said you are a guy who is being hustled waiting to happen.
JAKE
I don’t mind being hustled.
ERHARD
I said you are a guy who is being hustled waiting to happen.
JAKE
I don’t see it that way.
Erhard came down from the stage and sat on the edge of the platform near him.
Dasein
At the outset, it is important to introduce a term that is central 
in Martin Heidegger’s work, and will therefore begin to come up 
here almost immediately.
Dasein is Heidegger’s word for the Being of human beings,
and is one of the few terms in English editions of his writing 
that consistently remain untranslated from the German. In 
fact, the 2014 Dictionary of Untranslatables, published by
Princeton University Press, calls the word “a paradigm of the 
untranslatable,” and devotes six double-columned pages to a
struggle to explain it (Adam Gopnik, “Word Magic,” New Yorker,. 
May 26, 2014, 37).
A problem with translating this term, of course, is that term
is central in Heidegger’s most important work, Being and Time, 
in which he presents his ontological model of human beings. 
The specific elements of this model will be discussed in further 
detail as we proceed. For now, it is sufficient to note that Dasein 
will be spoken of as if the term indicates an individual; but since
it indicates the Being of that individual, it refers at the same time 
more broadly to the collective Being of human beings.

ERHARD
You’re oriented around being hustled. You would see hustle where other people wouldn’t be
smart enough to see it.
JAKE
I could go along with that.
ERHARD
You are a guy who is being hustled waiting to happen. Remember I said people are upset wait-
ing to happen? You’re hustle waiting to happen.
JAKE
I’m still not getting it.
ERHARD
Okay good, then we’ll keep doing it until you do get it.
JAKE
In front of all these people? 
ERHARD
Sure. You see hustle where others don’t. You are already always being hustled. You are waiting 
for it to happen. You wake up that way in the morning, you just don’t have the circumstances to 
express it yet.
JAKE
I think I see that... I am. I’m on the watch-out. I watch my bucks.
ERHARD
I’ve already got your bucks, don’t I? Before this is over I’m going to get some more of your
bucks.
JAKE
That’s a challenge.
ERHARD
With you, I’d almost bet on it.
He remained seated on the edge of the platform as this interaction modulated from confrontational 
to friendly.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (continuing)
That by the way was meant as a compliment. I’m going to off er you an opportunity to do this 
for the rest of your life, because I’m clear that you’re going to get a lot of value out of this and
I’m going to off er you the opportunity to get more value. You will always have the power to
decline. I want you to know that’s there in the relationship between me and you. I have no
reluctance to hustling you, because you always have the power to decline. Is that clear?
JAKE
Yeah, I got it.
The fi rst morning of The Forum continued as a dialogue with the group as Erhard responded to
participants’ questions. One woman expressed a concern that the content would go “over her head.”
ERHARD
Most of what I say is not designed for your head. Understanding is not the problem in life. If 
you took a four-day course in how to be a tennis player and you left the course as a great tennis 
player without understanding a word of it, the diff erence would be your being a great tennis
player. We don’t promise you any understanding. You’re welcome to understand. I like this 
stuff , so I enjoy understanding it. That’s a quirk in me. We do this so that there’s a freedom
to be. If you walk out understanding, that’s the booby prize. You walk out of here with the 
freedom to be that you didn’t have when you walked in here, then you got something for your
money. Speaking in here is designed to create the freedom to be... You don’t understand what 
that means. What interests me is the freedom to be. You’ll be interested in that too before this 
is over. I’ve done The Forum before so I know it works out.
A woman stated that she was already always nervous.
ERHARD (to the group)
How many people in here are already always nervous? 
(most raising their hands)
You understand that the things that are going on with you are going on with everybody? You’re 
like a rainstorm. You’ve got to get that there’s nothing personal about a rainstorm—that is,
that it waters the little fl owers. You think that the rainstorm is worried about life on earth. You 
think that it rains so that... it rains in-order-to. It’s true that life is sustained by the rain, but it’s
not true that it rains in-order-to.
SAL (standing up, receiving a microphone)
You’re just arguing semantics.
ERHARD
No, it’s not semantics. Or the other answer to that is, yes it’s semantics, but so is everything else 
in the universe.
Two Theses
The first thesis of this book, which will be addressed directly in 
the text, is that the work of Werner Erhard is aligned in important 
ways with the thinking of Martin Heidegger. Our purpose is to 
show this alignment through a comparative analysis of their work, 
an analysis that not only illuminates the thinking of both men, but 
sheds light as well on the nature of their shared central concern.
The second thesis, equal in importance to the first, cannot 
be addressed directly in the text. We have indicated it with the 
term Being, since unless we indicate it we cannot talk about it—as 
Heidegger puts it, “one cannot get by in public without rubrics” 
(OWL 29). But the term serves merely as a place-holder, since 
what it indicates cannot be thought, or even thought about, in our

SAL 
I believe that when it rains it rains in order to sustain life.
ERHARD
Okay, let’s stay there. Anybody else in that ballpark with Sal? Stand up if you are. Stand up if it 
rains in-order-to.
(a number of people rose)
If you’re not standing and you are an in-order-to, you’re interfering with your participation in 
The Forum. These people who are standing are not silly. They’ve got their foot nailed to the 
fl oor someplace. This will happen to all of you a lot of times during The Forum.
(to Sal, indicating the director’s chair on the platform)
Are the legs there to hold up the chair? We know that the legs do hold up the chair. For the legs, 
is there any in-order-to? Are the legs in-ordering-to?
(pausing) 
It’s too hard that way... let me try something diff erent. Is the wall standing in order to hold the
ceiling up?
SAL 
Yes, in my opinion. 
ERHARD
Does the lightning lightning in order to start forest fi res?
SAL 
No.
ERHARD
Where is this organ of intentionality in the rainstorm?
SAL 
The spirituality of the universe.
ERHARD  (to the group)
He just told me where his foot’s nailed to the fl oor. He’s got something he believes so he can’t 
think about it.
(to Sal)
You think there’s an intentionality in the rainstorm. You said it’s your belief that matter was
invaded by spirit in some way. Does it rain in order to produce fl oods?
usual way of conceptualizing. Think “freedom” and a conceptual
barrage is evoked; think “Being” and the mind’s resources are few. 
Our second thesis, since it eludes capture in concepts, 
can only be hinted at. It exists always as a background, 
in a domain of language that remains always unspoken. 
Unspoken, it is the unexamined context that shapes the way we
understand everything else; unspoken, it is made present as 
the transformational background in the dialogue of The Forum;
unspoken, it is hinted at persistently in Heidegger’s writing and in 
his lectures. Our second thesis, then, is this unspoken domain of 
language, formally referred to as the ontological realm. 
In this book, to show what Werner Erhard and Martin 
Heidegger are doing in their work, the authors are called upon 
to say—to hint at—the unspoken shared dynamic at the center 
of that work. Inevitably, an element of mystery attends this
topic; but nothing here is devious or arcane. While ontological
communication makes rigorous demands on our everyday
understanding, Erhard’s work is a practical pedagogical 
methodology, demonstrating that education beyond the merely 
epistemological is a real-world possibility.
The authors intend that our second thesis will be 
communicated in the background as we proceed through this
book, leaving the reader with a hint of its nature as it emerges in
The Forum. 
One aspect of this background communication is that 
unfamiliar terms or concepts may not be fully defined at the 
point of their first appearance. Rather, they will be distinguished 
gradually as they appear and reappear in the text. A definition
specifies conceptual limits; a distinction opens a space for 
thinking and acting, and the space is expanded each time the
distinction is encountered. The goal of the inquiry, then, is 
never an answer, but the opening of a question from which 
to experience the world. We invite the reader to embrace the 
freedom that this background of questionability gives: at play in 
the question, you don’t need the right answer.  ■

SPEAKING BEING
SAL 
No.
ERHARD
So the intentionality organ is not operating when it produces fl oods?
SAL
No, that just happens.
ERHARD
But it doesn’t just happen that when it rains life is sustained? Remember, Sal, there’s no ques-
tion between you and me that water does sustain life. The  question is: does it rain in-order-to? 
Or does it just happen, and by the way, it sustains life?
At this point Sal seemed to see Erhard’s point, and sat down.
ERHARD (to Sal)
Okay. Now, just something personal between you and me. I’ve done this a lot. There’s some-
thing I appreciated about you in this conversation. You were open in the conversation.
(to the group)
Nobody’s ever going to win with me in here. Because this is my game, and only an asshole 
would try to win in another guy’s game. You and I had a discussion where we got something
t
together. Rain is impersonal. We weren’t talking about a higher order of things. I don’t want 
anybody to believe anything I say. And I’m not interested in sustaining anything you believe.
BLAKE (recalling what had happened up to this moment in the conversation)
I know that there was some sequence and I missed it. I mentioned that I was nervous, that I 
didn’t like it, and then we were talking about the rain.
ERHARD (to the group)
He just demonstrated not knowing, being clear he didn’t know. That’s diff erent from being con-
fused. This is one of those things to get. There’s a diff erence between knowing that you don’t
understand, knowing that you didn’t follow something; knowing something didn’t make sense 
and being confused are very diff erent. You didn’t invent being nervous. Even though the rain is 
impersonal, you do personally get wet. The same thing goes for being nervous. Being nervous 
is part of being human. Being human doesn’t belong to you; you belong to it. You didn’t invent 
being human. You were late for the party. Being human is an already always way of being that
you walked into. It’s like a rainstorm, and it’s true you personally got wet. You are a human
Ontologic al Dialogue
A striking aspect of Erhard’s method, one which appears again 
and again throughout The Forum, is his persistence in pressing 
any interaction or any topic of discussion through to completion. 
Complete, for Erhard, does not mean simply finished, but rather 
whole, and lacking none of its essential parts. Repeatedly, after 
he has been engaged on a particular point with an individual, he 
requests that others in the room who are not clear on that point 
stand, and works with each participant individually until all of 
them have “gotten” it for themselves. Erhard often uses the term 
“flatten” in the same sense, as in “Let’s get that one flat before 
we move on.” To get something flat, in an ontological dialogue, 
means that the item in question has been moved beyond a purely
conceptual level of understanding, and has been distinguished 
as an ontological possibility, at least in a preliminary sense. The
distinction will continue to be teased out as The Forum proceeds, 
ultimately becoming a clearing for Being; but the first step in that 
process is to flatten the concept, so that its ontological possibility 
can be heard. 
Of course, “getting it” and “being complete” might be 
read as “having surrendered to Erhard’s point of view.” Erhard 
himself seemed to support this interpretation, telling one Forum 
participant Blake, “Nobody’s ever going to win with me in here. 
Because this is my game, and only an asshole would try to win in 
another guy’s game.” During a debriefing session with The Forum 
leaders regarding their role in the dialogue, Erhard again referred 
to the process in agonistic terms: “You’ve got to have some 
appreciation for the advantage you’ve got there,” he said. “And 
yeah, you’re going to use the advantage, that’s part of the game.”

being, but you didn’t make up human being. You didn’t invent being nervous. You didn’t invent
having a barrier to expressing yourself. That doesn’t belong to you. That’s not yours. That’s in
the already always being of human being. It doesn’t belong to you; you belong to it.
(forcefully)
It owns you! You don’t own it. Being nervous owns your life. You don’t own being nervous. The 
metaphor is that there’s nothing personal about a rainstorm. It just rains, and I, you, personally 
get wet. But the rainstorm didn’t rain in order to get me wet. Being nervous is already always
there in the being of being human. And you and I walk out into that rainstorm and get wet... 
In The Forum, you get back the power to say something about your own way of being. Now 
you can only report on it. But you can’t say “I’m not nervous” and have it make any diff erence. 
After The Forum you will be able to.
BLAKE
I’m not as nervous as when I first stood up. I am here to make a change, find a new occupa-
tion, to get up in front of people. What it requires is getting up.
ERHARD
Not necessarily.
BLAKE
Well, I don’t know.
ERHARD
That’s right. And I do know.
BLAKE
That’s why I’m asking you.
ERHARD
I want to get it settled because you’re going to keep saying those stupid kinds of things: what
you have to do and what you don’t have to do for this to work. And the answer is you don’t
know. So I’m gonna tell you: what you have to do is what you do. So you’ll always know what
you have to do because you’re doing what you’re doing. To do something you’re not doing:
that’s bad. If you do what you do it’ll all work out. One of the things that you are doing is think-
ing you have to stand up. That’s fi ne for you to think that. You wanna know why I think it’s
fi ne for him to think that? Because that’s what he’s thinking.
BLAKE
You’re right. At some point you broke through whatever was in the way and now you’re up
there doing what you are doing.
The game in The Forum is the evocation of the presence 
of Being, and The Forum leader’s opponent is the way of being
that we in the technological age have been born into (the way 
we wound up being). Clearly, there is a certain direction which 
must be maintained in The Forum dialogue if its purpose is
to be achieved. The maintenance of this direction in the face 
of participants’ resistance might appear, to the everyday
understanding, as motivated by a need on The Forum leader’s
part to win the game, so that The Forum’s perspective is shown 
to be the true one. However, accepted in The Forum is that The
Forum leader’s responsibility is maintaining the ontological 
character of the conversation. “My job,” said Erhard, “is to 
manage the dialogue.” This management is not a matter of 
winning, but of keeping the way in view. In a recent conversation 
with the authors, Erhard put it this way: “I used this way of 
speaking to deal with people who are resisting in order to resist, 
rather than functioning in a dialogue.”
Any discussion of dialogue as pedagogy must always consider 
the question of mutuality, and this is especially delicate when the
dialogue’s purpose is the presencing of Being. The Forum leaders’ 
rank in The Forum dialogue is given by their ability to listen to 
the conversation from a certain perspective. As Erhard told The 
Forum leaders, “You’ve got to know that an authentic dialogue is 
going to generate clarity. You’ve also got to watch you don’t get
hooked. What hooks [you] is when someone says something that
you think puts you at a disadvantage.” Being hooked, for a Forum
leader, means being drawn into argument or commiseration with
participants’ stories about their lives, rather than maintaining
the transformed perspective given by The Forum’s ontological
distinctions. It is The Forum leader’s job not to get hooked.
This balance between mutuality and directedness in an 
ontological dialogue is an important matter. Obviously, there is
a thrust to such a dialogue—a movement of the conversation in 
the direction of its ontological intention. In his dialogue with the
Japanese scholar in On the Way to Language, Heidegger points 
to the nature of true dialogue when he states that “we may

BLAKE (pausing)
It’s really hard for me not to be funny.
ERHARD
Yeah. You’re already always funny.
BLAKE
And I don’t want to be silly or you’re going to get mad at me. It’s just a temptation to always be
funny.
ERHARD
It’s the way you avoid dealing with what you don’t want to deal with, which is being anything 
but funny. That’s what you don’t want to deal with. You learned how to deal with being funny.
You got that down very well and the rest of it you’re a little nervous about. But you’re not ner-
vous about being funny, are you?
BLAKE
No.
ERHARD
And you’re not nervous about whatever your racket is either. You’re just nervous about the rest
of it. I know you don’t understand half of what we’re talking about, but that’s all right. Just the

BLAKE
I don’t want to be nervous anymore.
ERHARD

BLAKE
I’m not a dictator and so I have to live with the things I’m not comfortable with, and when I’m
uncomfortable, other people are uncomfortable. I don’t like that.
ERHARD
Thanks... The next subject. Everybody ready for the next subject?
A participant named Charles, who was still concerned with the conversation about the rain, rose.
CHARLES
I’m with “it rains so that life is sustained.”
confidently entrust ourselves to the hidden drift of our 
dialogue. . . as long as we remain inquirers” (“DL” in OWL 30,
emphasis added). In true dialogue—which always has an 
unspoken ontological intent—the dialogue itself can be trusted to 
move us along if we, as participants, continue to be a certain way. 
Notice the reflexive nature of the process: simultaneous surrender 
and evocation. In The Forum, the maintenance of this delicate 
balance is The Forum leader’s task.
A central element of The Forum’s effectiveness is the
inclusiveness of its conversation: interactions between The Forum 
leader and those participants who actively engage in the dialogue
are conducted in front of the entire group, so that even those 
participants who are listening and observing are able to derive 
the benefits of those interactions. 
For both Heidegger and Erhard, a shared tendency of human
being underlies all of our diverse individual and cultural concerns. 
The assumption of The Forum’s methodology is that a skillfully 
managed dialogue between two people can affect the ontological
insight of others who are listening to that dialogue, and who share
the tendency of being that generates it. 
A participant whose concern is her relationship with her 
employer can recognize, in another participant’s discussion of his 
problems with his mother, the same existential structure that is at 
the source of her own problem. Thus The Forum leader regularly 
exhorts participants to “listen from your own concerns.” ■

Forum Day One: Session One

ERHARD
What we were discussing is this in-order-to. I say the rain has no intention to do anything.
There’s nothing there that could intend. It just rains when it rains. There’s no intention in the
rain. Look, Charles, I’m doing something in the conversation which is designed to allow you to
take a look at your own beliefs. I’m asking questions which reduce your thesis to an absurdity.
If I ask if it rains in order to destroy life, you have to say yes if you believe that it rains in order
to sustain life, and so it makes you reexamine your theory. If you can consider the possibility 
that there is no intention in the rainstorm, then you are no longer stuck with what you used to 
believe.
CHARLES
I’ll keep looking at it.
ERHARD
We have to go quickly now or there won’t be any fi fth night. There’ll be a twelfth night. 
Someone raised a question about why participants were not allowed to take notes in The Forum, a policy 
that had been communicated when they registered for the course.
ERHARD
Because we don’t want you to retain information. So you don’t get stuck trying to remember 
something. You think Bjorn Borg remembers how to hold the tennis racket? This is no diff erent
than the conversation about the rainstorm.
(loudly)
You have this superstition that you do things because you remember how to do them! You don’t 
drive your car, play tennis, or live life powerfully and eff ectively out of anything you remember. 
If Joe Montana had to remember how to throw the football when he’s back in the pocket, he’d
get killed every Sunday.
A woman named Doris rose with a question about the rainstorm:
DORIS
What about the role of ultimate being in natural events?
ERHARD
I don’t like to discuss ultimate being with people who don’t know their ass from a hole in the 
ground.
DORIS
I fi nd that response pretty off ensive.

SPEAKING BEING
DORIS (stammering slightly) 
Are you inferring that I don’t . . .?
ERHARD
No.
(pausing) 
We don’t know yet. 
DORIS
I assure you I do. 
ERHARD
Really? We’ll see. You either do or you don’t, so there’s nothing to be nervous about. Then we 
could discuss ultimate being. 
(pausing)
I want you to get that I am not a guy in a diner.
He moved toward the back row where Doris was standing:
ERHARD (continuing) 
When I was growing up on the east coast, my family took trips to visit people. And we would 
drive home, oftentimes very late at night, oftentimes when it was raining or snowing or nasty. 
And diners, as far as I knew, were places where you stopped to get a cup of coff ee so you could
stay awake while you were driving. And at my age I couldn’t let anybody do anything without
my being there, so I always had to go in with them. And I learned about guys in diners. Guys in
diners, late at night like I’m describing to you, are usually fairly lonely, because they don’t have 
anybody to talk to. And they just love for somebody to stop in because then they’ve got some-
body to talk to. And you know, you go in, and you’re the only person there, and you sit up at the
counter, and you have your cup of coff ee and whatever else. And you fi nd out that this guy in 
the  diner—the guy behind the counter—knows everything about everything. There is nothing 
about which he does not know. He knows what the president ought to do about the defi cit, he 
knows what the country ought to do about international relationships, he knows what you 
ought to do about your marriage, he knows what kind of work you ought to do and how what-
ever kind of work you are doing how you could do it better, he knows something about every-
thing. Most people are like a guy in a diner. Goddamned near everybody knows everything 
about everything. So in here—at least in The Forum—I question everything. Everything—in-
cluding whether or not you know your ass from a hole in the ground. And whether anyone is
qualifi ed to discuss ultimate being. I didn’t say you weren’t. That’s the way I do The Forum.
(to Doris)
Okay? 
Being-in-the-world: Being-in
An important term that Werner Erhard often employs in his work, 
and one which is central in the thinking of Martin Heidegger is 
Being-in-the-world. To indicate clearly that a human being in his 
model of things is not a self-contained Cartesian subject, separate 
from an objective world “out there,” Heidegger never presents 
Dasein’s Being as disconnected, either from others or from the 
world. Dasein’s Being is Being-in-the-world. This indicates “a
unitary phenomenon” which “must be seen as a whole” (
y
BT 78).
T
However, while “Being-in-the-world cannot be broken up into 
contents which may be pieced together,” the constituent parts 
may be “brought out for emphasis.” One of these parts is Being-in.

Forum Day One: Session One 
21
DORIS 
Okay.
She sat. A man rose to object to Erhard’s earlier assertion that our ways of being, such as nervous-
ness, own us. 
FOSTER
I understand that being nervous is a human quality. Why don’t I own being nervous? Isn’t that 
a quality of me? 
ERHARD 
Where is this quality? 
FOSTER (pointing to his heart)
Here, and it’s pounding! 
ERHARD 
My dog’s heart pounds. You and I explain things about people by assigning qualities to them. 
But this may not be eff ective if what you want to do is have access to the things you’re explain-
ing. The language we use every day is designed to explain things. The language we use in here 
is designed to gain access to things. So it’s a diff erent language. Explanations give no access to
power. If you want power and access, we’re going to invent such a language in here. I’m not 
limited to merely reporting the way I am. I’m an anti-quality-ist. You ain’t got any qualities 
inside you. Qualities are an explanatory principle. It won’t hold up on closer examination. 
Erhard was now in the aisle, moving among the participants. One rose to defend the importance of 
having what he called self-beliefs.
RAY
How does one hold beliefs about oneself and about reality in a way to be powerful and creative?
ERHARD
One of the ways is to not have any beliefs. Does anyone need to believe that the fl oor is there? 
You don’t need to have any belief about the fl oor and it works just fi ne. And if you didn’t have 
any beliefs about gravity it would work just fi ne. You only need to believe in things that you 
doubt. The only problem with belief is that you can’t think about anything you believe.
k
RAY
I have an interpretation about myself, and how do I hold that interpretation?
ERHARD
As an interpretation.
Being-in articulates an essentially different relationship
from the one we usually have in mind when we say something is
“in” something. If we say “the water is in the glass,” for example, 
the two phenomena being related have a prior and individual 
existence in space: the water was there, and the glass was there. 
We have simply put one in the other. Further, as Heidegger points
out, we can easily extend such relationships outward: the glass is
on the table, the table is in the kitchen, the kitchen is in the house, 
and so on, until finally we can say that the water is in “world 
space” (BT 79).
T
Objects such as the glass and the table are, in Heidegger’s 
vocabulary, “things occurring ‘within’ the world” (BT 79).
T
Therefore they have a different kind of being from Dasein. The
table and the glass are whats; their characteristics are categorical.
While the table and the glass can have a location-relationship
within the world, the water is not in the glass in the same way that
a human being is in-the-world. 
Dasein, on the other hand, is a who, and its characteristics
are existential, which define an existence structure quite different
from that of a table. This is, of course, on one level obvious. 
But Heidegger, remember, is languaging a view of the world 
that is very different from our everyday way of understanding
things. Therefore he is rigorous in setting out the terminological 
differences between states of being.
A chair can be next to the wall, but the chair can never touch
the wall, “even if the space between them should be equal to
zero” (BT 81). Heidegger is not making a sensory distinction but 
T
an ontological one. To touch is to encounter meaningfully, and 
such meaningful encounters are possible only for entities with
meaning. In Heidegger’s vocabulary, a table and a chair are 
worldless.
Werner Erhard can be seen as distinguishing worldlessness 
early in The Forum, in his interactions with participants on the
subject of whether the rain falls in order to water the flowers. In 
doing so, he is beginning to create an understanding of meaning 
as a human characteristic, rather than an aspect of the things out
there in the world. This distinction will be further developed later

SPEAKING BEING
RAY
Thank you.
Shortly before the fi rst break of the morning, Erhard introduced a new topic: 
ERHARD
The next subject is the matter of your being here. At the upcoming break, you will be given an 
opportunity to leave and have your money refunded. You want to listen up! I’m going to give
you the opportunity not to be here. You shouldn’t be here if you didn’t put yourself here. The 
Forum won’t work for you anyhow, so you’re wasting your time here. You shouldn’t be here if 
you’re here because you were threatened. We don’t allow people to participate in The Forum
who were coerced or threatened. You may have been here on that basis up till now. You can 
leave now and you’ll get all your money back. And if you’ll get in trouble with whoever you’re
here for, I’ll write a note that says that you begged and pleaded and tried to stay here and I 
threw you out. If you’re here because you were pressured into being here, would you stand up 
please?
(one participant stood)
Anybody else?
(another long pause as another stood) 
I’m going to say “Anybody else?” fi ve more times.
Eventually several people stood in response to his request, and he began to interact with them
individually. The interactions varied strikingly in their tone. With the fi rst participant, a teenager 
named Kathy, Erhard’s manner was quite gentle. He moved closer to her, standing at a distance of 
about four feet. Before beginning the conversation, he asked her if she was willing to interact with 
him in front of the group, acknowledging that it might be “scary” for her to do so. He then reiterat-
ed his assertion that pressure, like embarrassment and hustle, was a clearing she was bringing to 
the circumstances:
ERHARD (continuing)
I know that if you’re here because somebody pressured you to be here, that that’s an issue in 
your life. The only people who experience being pressured about The Forum are those for 
whom pressure is an issue. I’m giving you the opportunity to make a choice. Now that I’ve
given you the choice, would you like to leave or would you like to be here? There will be no bad
results from you leaving. You’ll get your money back. 
KATHY 
That’s good. I feel like I have the opportunity to choose now, whereas, before, I didn’t feel like
that.
on the first day when participants’ stories about the events in 
their lives are distinguished from the events themselves.
Human beings exist in a world of meaning, and their 
relationship with that world is fundamental. In-ness is an aspect
of Dasein’s existence from the ground up. Consider: a human
being never exists as a (meaningful) human being until she exists
in-the-world, and when she leaves the world (dies), she ceases to
exist (as a human being). Heidegger’s German term for the Being-
in relationship (Sein bei) carries the implication of what we would
call being at home (BT 80, note 3). Dasein is at home in the world,
T
Being-with others. “Being-with” is examined in the first sidebar of 
Session One of Day Two, and we address the “world” of Being-in-
the-world at the beginning of Session One of Day Four. ■

ERHARD
I only do this work with people for whom it’s going to be successful, so I’m not willing to do 
this work except on the basis that people chose to be here. What’s your choice?
KATHY
I choose to be in The Forum. 
ERHARD
No coercion? That’s your choice? Made freely?
KATHY
Yes. 
ERHARD
Thank you for going through the process in front of all these people.
Along with Kathy, two other people sat down. The only participant who remained standing was a 
young man in the front row named Bill, who spoke as soon as an assistant got a microphone to him:
BILL (angrily)
I think there’s kind of a thin line between choice and being compelled to do something because
someone cared enough to continuously call me up and get me here.
ERHARD (moving in to a face-to-face stance with Bill)
You’re an asshole, and somebody...
BILL
Your language is bad.
ERHARD
It’s much worse than you think it is. You don’t want to fuck with me.
BILL
You don’t scare me.
ERHARD
You’re in my game, my friend, you don’t want to fuck with me.
BILL
Someone should use language to try to clear a point.
ERHARD
I understand what you believe. I’m not interested.

BILL
That’s quite obvious.
ERHARD
Now do you have something to say that’s thoughtful? Because I’m not interested in your beliefs.
BILL
You’re competing with me in your lack of thoughtfulness in the terminology that you use on a 
regular basis, my friend.
ERHARD
Really?
BILL
Yes. Thoughtfulness is as thoughtfulness does. To be thoughtful I would expect a mutual kind
of communication.
ERHARD
You got a mutual kind of communication. You got bullshit for bullshit.
BILL
Thank you very much. You are quite impressive.
ERHARD
Thank you. Are you here because you were pressured into being here?
BILL
I drove here.
ERHARD
I understand. Were you pressured into being here? I know you’re not here because you were 
pressured into being here. I can take one look at you and know that wasn’t true. I know you’re
up there to fuck with me.
BILL
Now...
ERHARD
Hold on, let me talk for a while. So you’re going to tell me the story about people called you a 
lot of times and people kept inviting you and kept saying you were supposed to. Understand? 
That’s the story you’re going to tell me and I already know the story. You won’t be the fi rst
person with that story. This is a story I’ve heard a lot of times. Now why was I bad with you 
MOOD
Heidegger’s masterwork, Being and Time, presents a model of 
human being that focuses on our lived, everyday experience. This
“average everydayness,” he says, has been generally disregarded
in attempts to understand our nature. It is so apparent and well-
known to us that we fail to recognize the ontological significance
of its elements. One of these elements is mood.
Mood, or state-of-mind (
d Befindlichkeit) is a manifestation of 
the moment-to-moment way one is automatically attuned to the 
world. My mood provides a context—a background environment—
in which I move; it pervades and colors my relationship to 
whatever I am up to at any moment, for instance, when Erhard 
says “your pessimism is you.” In bad moods, “Dasein becomes 
blind to itself” (BT 175). And while we may not notice it, says
T
Heidegger, a human being always has some mood, even when its 
specific nature is elusive: 
The pallid, evenly balanced lack of mood, 
which is oft en persistent and which is not to be 
mistaken for a bad mood, is far from nothing
at all. Rather, it is in this that Dasein becomes 
satiated with itself. Being has become
manifest as a burden. Why that should be, one
does not know.
w (BT 173) 
T
“
Furthermore, “when we master a mood, we do so by way
of a counter-mood; we are never free of moods” (BT 175). Mood
T
is the persistent background of our lives. Our moods come over 
us, and our cognition cannot reach their source: “The pure ‘that 
it is’ shows itself, but the ‘whence’ and the ‘whither’ remain in 
darkness” (BT 173).
T
This last point will be seen as significant as The Forum 
approaches its climax: we are always brought before ourselves

just now? Because I want to get this story up. There’s a lot of people with that story here and
I want to get that story killed. I got people’s attention here. I got your attention too, but more
important: I got their attention.
(to the group)
I know you’ve got a story about how you got here. That’s your story. I don’t know what the truth 
is. I know Bill was a pain in the ass.
BILL
Thank you.
ERHARD
You were, and you probably are most of the time. Do other people in here know you?
BILL
I’m not sure.
ERHARD
If I had a group of your friends here and asked them, “can Bill be a real pain in the ass?” what 
would they say? 
BILL 
Well I imagine if they pushed me to extremes...
(laughter)
ERHARD (shaking his head)
Wait, wait. That’s not what I mean. I mean, if I said to your friends, “can Bill be a real pain in
the ass?” what would they say? I would bet they would say “yes.” More than infrequently.
BILL
What about your friends?
ERHARD
Let me explain something to you.
BILL
You put me on the spot, why can’t I put you on the spot?
ERHARD
I didn’t pay to be in here, you did. Because you invested $625 to come to my seminar. But if I
leave here and I’m still an asshole, I didn’t lose anything. If you’ve got a seminar that keeps you 
in our moods, but we tend to turn away from what they might 
reveal. In moods, we find ourselves, but “in a way of finding which 
arises not so much from a direct seeking as rather from a fleeing”
(BT 174). In our assured, everyday way of speaking, we dismiss
T
a state-of-mind, or rather, an attunement, as “just a mood I’m 
in.” But in doing so, we evade a more primordial disclosure, an
understanding which stares us in the face “with the inexorability
of an enigma” (BT 175). 
T
At this early point in the proceedings, Erhard is making two 
important moves. First, he is suggesting to the participants that
the nature of their moods is not what they have taken them to
be. They are not a product of the circumstances, but are instead 
an aspect of their own way of being. Second, he is urging the
participants not to attempt to avoid or transcend their moods,
however uncomfortable they may seem, but rather to allow them,
and to bring them into The Forum so that they can be part of the 
process. As The Forum proceeds, these suggestions will be seen
as crucial to the development of the ontological dialogue. ■

BILL
You know I have to say something. The only value I’ve gotten so far is entertainment from your 
cynicism.
ERHARD
You remember when I said you would be sitting there with your judgments and assessments?
BILL
Believe me, I’m here with an open mind.
This interaction, which was in its early moments the most belligerent of the entire four days, grad-
ually became playful. Bill began to smile, and the dialogue assumed the character of good-natured
sparring.
ERHARD
Back to the issue of pressure. Did you get a lot of phone calls?
BILL
From one lady in particular. During the process I was trying to prospect her into something 
and in the end she prospected me into something.
(laughter)
ERHARD
I’m not going to ask what you were prospecting her into. But at any rate there was a lady who
called you a number of times.
BILL
She’s married, Werner.
ERHARD
It’s hard to have this conversation with you with your foot nailed to the fl oor. How many times
did she call?
BILL
I don’t know. A half dozen to a dozen times. Perhaps more.

No.
ERHARD
So you never told her “no,” right?
BILL
Never directly “no.”
ERHARD (turning to the group)
I’m revealing the nature of pressure. That’s what Bill and I are having this conversation
about. Nobody does The Forum because they were pressured into it.
(Erhard placed his hands on Bill’s head and pushed down)
That’s what pressure is. But what had the people from the Center done? They called you. They 
spoke to you. What else did they do? They stayed engaged in the conversation with you because
you never said no.
BILL
They called me every day. 
ERHARD
Every day?

Well, maybe every other day.

You all have a story, and your story is as full of shit as Bill’s. And I’m using language that’s

Hesitantly, Bill sat down.
ERHARD
Do I take that to mean that you’ve chosen to be here?
BILL
Yes. 
ERHARD (to the group)
All Bill’s doing is doing you a favor. He’s letting you see yourself. That’s an extraordinary gift, 
to see yourself.
(turning back to Bill)
I want to apologize to you for saying things that you found off ensive. Do you accept my 
apology?
BILL
Yes, I do. 
ERHARD 
I’m not clear you’re here because you chose to be here.
BILL 
Yes. But I’m not clear if I’ll get the results.
 ERHARD
And you won’t be. How The Forum works is you learn nothing. And then you learn more noth-
ing. And then you learn it all at once. It’s an all of a sudden phenomenon. 
(pausing) 
What we just went through is very important. I brought something to that conversation that’s 
designed to leave you in a diff erent place about those conversations. I predict that when The
Forum is over you’ll tell me this was the most important experience in your whole life. We’ll
see. There’s a bit of a risk here, and I accept that.
Erhard fi nally left Bill, and addressed the group, moving among them.
ERHARD
Nobody participates in programs that I lead because they were pressured. A lot of people are 
here because they’ve got reasons to be here. And I want you to know you’re not here because 
of your reasons. You put yourself in that chair, and not your reasons. You’ve got a story called
force, and what actually happened was somebody spoke to you. If you live in a story called 
force, your life will look like a response to force. See, most of you live in response to a story you 
made up. You live in a sea of reasons. But I want you to be clear, you put yourself in that chair,
“
 If you live in a story called force, your life
will look like a response to force.

not the reasons, nobody else and nothing else. And you have reasons. That’s what I mean by 
people don’t know their ass from a hole in the ground. People don’t know what put them in that
chair. If you’re stuck with this idea that you were pressured, I want you out of here. I’m going 
to say a lot of things in here and you’re only going to get them almost. I know that today you’re
going to get almost nothing I say, because you’re going to put it in the language in which you
dwell. Like “should.” I don’t dwell in the language of should. It’s patently obvious here. I’m 
asking you who’s buried in Grant’s Tomb. This is not hard. You put yourself here.
A participant raised a question about a friend he wanted to do The Forum. He described the man.
PARTICIPANT
Would he feel pressured? 
ERHARD
Yeah, because he’s an asshole.
PARTICIPANT (laughs)
Yeah, that’s true.
ERHARD
You see, you can’t pressure people who are straight. They give clear answers, like “no,” or 
“don’t call me.” I invite people. I want to be clear what I mean by an invitation. An invitation
for me always carries with it the power to decline.
Erhard mounted the platform, and announced a break. However, he said, “in The Forum there are 
no breaks,” so he gave the participants an assignment.
ERHARD
The assignment during the break is to sort out your “story” from “what happened.” Most people 
live in the story and don’t live in the what happened. And there’s something disempowering 
about living in the story instead of living in the what happened. The problem is that you are 
thrown—that’s like already always—you are thrown to the story. You are addicted to the story.
“People don’t like me” and “being insulted” never happen. I’m going to demonstrate insulting. 
I’m going to insult you: I insult you. For the fi rst time in your life you’ve now been insulted as a

Forum Day One: Session One

After Erhard left the room, Julie requested that due to the size of the group all participants should
be respectful of the hotel. She pointed out the assistants who could direct participants to pay phones
and bathrooms. “We request that you don’t eat on this break,” she said. “If you must eat for medical
reasons, please see Wes,” one of the two Forum leaders who were assisting Erhard. Finally she in-
troduced the other four Forum supervisors who were working with her, and who were available to
answer their questions. Finally, as she would before every break, she read the names of participants
who had received telephone messages during the session.
The Forum adjourned for a break at 12:40 pm.

SPEAKING BEING
Hints: Ontological Distinctions
The Forum achieves its result through the development in dialogue of what Werner 
Erhard calls distinctions. In traditional education, based in an epistemological model 
in which the goal is to increase or enhance what is known, information—concepts, 
ideas, processes—are communicated through definition and explanation. The Fo-
rum, however, develops an ontological model of education, in which the goal is not 
an increase in knowledge but an experience of Being. In this model, the elements of 
the course content are distinguished. 
The nature of distinctions will be addressed at length by Erhard later in The 
Forum. But here, early on the first morning, the development of distinctions is al-
ready under way. Erhard is beginning to employ an aspect of his methodology that, 
according to Martin Heidegger, is central to ontological communication: the use of 
hints to communicate what cannot directly be spoken, thereby providing access to 
the content as lived rather than as merely understood. 
Heidegger introduced the idea of hinting as a way of communicating Being in 
his 1959 essay, “A Dialogue on Language” (in OWL), which provides an account of 
his conversation with a Japanese scholar who shared his interest in ontological 
inquiry. The interaction, presented in the form of a transcript, occurs as a stately 
conversational dance, a linguistic minuet. Each move is made with great care, so the 
interaction proceeds at times with excruciating deliberateness. At one point Heide-
gger (referred to in the account as the Inquirer) poses a question—“Do you have in 
your language a word for what we call language?”—to which the scholar arrives at 
a tentative answer only after twenty-three pages of thoughtful circumnavigation in 
and around the topic. 
In response to a remark by the Japanese about language’s “essential being,” 
Heidegger refers to his often-quoted characterization of language as “the house of 
Being.” The phrase, he says, “gives a hint of the nature of language” (“DL” in OWL 
26). As the two men’s dialogue continues, the extraordinary attentiveness given 
to each word reveals a respect for the nature of hints. Hints, Heidegger observes, 
“belong to an entirely different realm of reality. . . . They are enigmatic. They beckon 
to us. They beckon away. They beckon us toward that from which they unexpectedly 
bear themselves toward us” (“DL” in OWL 26).
In his conversation with the Japanese scholar, Heidegger is distinguishing 
hinting, which is to say that he is hinting at the nature of hints. The Forum’s develop-
ment of distinctions is likewise a process of hinting. 
SESSION ONE INTERVAL
In hinting, words are spoken in such a way that “each word in each case is 
given its full—most often hidden—weight” (“DL” in OWL 31). What is not spoken, but 
communicated in the background, is allowed to reverberate. In this way a space is 
allowed to develop around each utterance:
[Inquirer]: Hints need the widest sphere in which to swing. . .
[Japanese]: . . . where mortals go to and fro only slowly.
[Inquirer]: This is what our language calls “hesitate.” It is done 
truly when slowness rests on shy reverence. And so I do not wish to 
disturb your hesitation by urging you on too rashly.
[Japanese]: You are more helpful to me in my attempt to say the 
word than you can know. (“DL” in OWL 27–28)
Further, although each distinction has a rubric for its topic—in this dialogue, the 
topic is the nature of language—in developing distinctions the aim is not to arrive at 
a correct verbal articulation of the rubric. On the contrary, the goal is to avoid such a 
resolution:
[Japanese]: We Japanese do not think it strange if a dialogue 
leaves undefined what is really intended, or even restores it 
back to the keeping of the undefinable.
[Inquirer]: That is part, I believe, of every dialogue that 
has turned out well between thinking beings. As if of its own 
accord, it can take care that that undefinable something not 
only does not slip away, but displays its gathering force ever 
more luminously in the course of the dialogue. (“DL” in OWL 13)
In this conversation, Heidegger and the Japanese scholar may be seen as 
enacting the methodology of The Forum: the dialogic development of distinctions 
through a process of hinting. Being cannot be verbalized. Being is in language, but 
it is not in the words that are spoken. It lives in the unspoken background, and in 
a conversation for Being, that background must be made present. Hints are an 
appropriate form for bringing a background to presence because they direct our 
attention toward something we had not noticed, something which they at the same 
time bring forward to meet us. 
Ontological hinting is not an easy form of communication to master, and by 
characterizing it here as an element of The Forum’s “methodology,” we have fallen 
prey to one of its pitfalls. When Heidegger says to the Japanese scholar that calling

language “the house of Being” gives a “hint of the nature of language,” the scholar 
immediately recognizes the danger: “I fear that to call your ‘house of Being’ a hint 
might tempt you and me to elaborate the notion of hinting into a guiding concept in 
which we then bundle up everything” (“DL” in OWL).  Heidegger concurs, but adds 
that this error can “never be prevented in the sense of being totally excluded,” since 
“the mode of conceptual representation insinuates itself all too easily into every 
kind of human experience” (“DL” in OWL 25). 
A relevant observation by the senior author: during my years of participation in 
Erhard’s work, the distinguishing of distinctions has remained a source of fascina-
tion, challenge, and even mystery for me. I have observed conversations between 
Forum leaders—people for whom the development of distinctions is central to their 
professional practice—in which the speaking occurred to me as a kind of short-
hand. Elements of everyday interaction—details,  transitions, connections—seemed 
to be missing. On one occasion, a statement by one Forum leader elicited this re-
sponse from another: “You’re explaining it. Distinguish it.” I found myself struggling 
to recognize the difference being referred to. 
An extensive hint at the nature of distinctions is found in Heidegger’s later work, 
where he turned his attention increasingly to the ontological possibilities of art, and 
specifically of poetry. Poetry, he said, is projective saying—that is, a kind of saying 
which projects a clearing for Being by speaking the unspoken. “Projective saying 
is saying which, in preparing the sayable, simultaneously brings the unsayable as 
such into a world” (“OWA” in PLT 71). But such saying is not limited to the speaking 
of the poet, because “Language itself is poetry in the essential sense” (“OWA” in PLT 
72). Indeed, “everyday language is a forgotten and used-up poem, from which there 
hardly resounds a call any longer” (“L” in PLT 205). 
The thinker, says Heidegger elsewhere, confines his thinking to a single 
thought (PLT 4). Heidegger’s single thought was the question of Being. A similar 
single-mindedness characterizes the poet, and so Heidegger’s description of the 
poet’s relation to the unsayable is useful:
Every great poet creates his poetry out of one single 
poetic statement only. . . . The poet’s statement remains 
unspoken. None of his individual poems, nor their totality, 
says it all. Nonetheless, every poem speaks from the whole 
of the one single statement, and in each instance says that 
statement. (“LP” in OWL 160)
“
Therefore all of Heidegger’s writing and all of Werner Erhard’s work, as well as all the 
poetry of Dickinson or Rilke or Wallace Stevens, may be seen as bodies of hints for 
the Saying of what is essentially unsayable.

SPEAKING BEING
During the forty-minute break, statements had been written on two of the chalkboards. On one: 
“Promise of The Forum: You can have anything out of The Forum that you are willing to stand for 
having gotten.” On the second: “The commitment of the work is Transformation: bringing forth a 
breakthrough in the possibility of being for human beings.”
As The Forum resumed, Erhard began with a question.
ERHARD
What happened when you were considering the diff erence between your story and what hap-
pened?
PARTICIPANT
I found that I didn’t want to confront my stories.
ERHARD
It’s possible to live in a kind of unconsciousness that we don’t ordinarily call unconsciousness
because we’re not knocked out. It’s an unconsciousness which appears as not being there. What 
you can’t be with prevents you from being. If you mash up the what happens and the story, it
kind of keeps you a little unconscious, because you don’t have to be with it. But when you start
to distinguish the story from what happened, you begin to see the story as a story, and it’s not 
very attractive that way, is it? And it’s something one would mostly avoid being with. There
will be a lot that will come up in here that you don’t want to be with. It’s useful to be with what
you don’t want to be with. What you’ve already learned to be with and survive with--that’s not 
going to be very useful in here, it’s the part you’ve avoided being with here. Anything else?
Thanks very much.
As participants responded to this question, Erhard contextualized their contributions by expanding
the distinctions he had introduced earlier in the day. 
JOHN
I’ve never really liked my wife’s version of the story of how we got married.
ERHARD
When you can recognize a person’s story as their story, you begin to have access to their version 
of the story, so that you’re not stuck with, you don’t have to resign yourself to, their version of 
the story. You have access to diff erent possibilities within the story, but not when it’s mashed up 
with what happened.
JOHN
I got so upset, I left the room, and while I heard the story from another part of the house, my 
upset turned toward wanting to get out of my marriage.
ERHARD  (interrupting)
You didn’t invent thinking about getting out of your marriage. That’s already always in the cul-
ture of being for human beings. You think, “oh well, this happened and that made me think I

Philosophy as Rhetorical Evocation
We propose that The Forum is an instance of ontological 
rhetoric. We emphasize at the outset that this is not the everyday 
understanding of rhetoric as “mere rhetoric,” that is, language that 
is superficial and disconnected from serious purposes. Rhetoric as 
we use the term is any use of language that is intended to produce 
a real-world result. Ontological rhetoric communicates in the 
unspoken realm of language to provide its listeners with access to 
the realm of Being. 
Recognition of the value and function of ontological 
rhetoric is found in the later writing of Henry W. Johnstone, 
Jr., founder of the journal, Philosophy and Rhetoric. Early in his 
career, Johnstone believed that the role of the philosophical 
rhetor was “to treat his audience as an object,” and that his goal 
should quit or leave.” That’s not the way it works. It’s a rainstorm. Leaving, getting out of things,
quitting—owns your life. It’s true you have the conversation with yourself personally. But that’s 
like getting wet in a rainstorm.
(with emphasis)
I’m not thinking that. That is thinking me.
(pausing)
I’m starting to talk like people don’t talk, because I want access to what concerns me that
people don’t have. So you and I are starting to invent a language that gives us access to the
things that are interesting, or important, that concern us in life. It’s not your thought. I want 
you to start to think that it thinks you. You have the thoughts like you get wet in the rain-
storm. I’m just asking you to begin to think in a way you haven’t thought before. The kind of 
person you are is given by that thinking, which isn’t your thoughts or your thinking.
JOHN
What I noticed was that each of us have diff erent stories about how we got together.
ERHARD
You can’t ask questions like “True?” about people’s stories. There’s no such thing as “true
”
stories.” “True” and “story” don’t go together. A story’s a story. People get into trouble in life
because they start believing their stories. Even worse, you start believing someone else’s story—
makes you a spear-carrier in somebody else’s opera. This is not a good way to live.
JOHN
We did what we did and got married.
ERHARD
Who is not clear about choosing to be married? The conversation about why you’re in The 
Forum could apply as well to you in your job, or your marriage. Almost nobody thinks they 
are anyplace because they put themselves there. But everybody puts themselves there. Then
you get the story about why you’re there. There’s no power in the story... You live in a story 
about being married. I accuse you that you live in a story about being married, and the 
quality of being married reflects that it in part is generated by a story. I didn’t say you don’t
have a good marriage. But it’s limited to a certain box, a certain space or quality, when it’s a 
story. What happened? You got married. Then there’s this whole story. And they’re distinct
from one another. The same thing is true about everything in life. See, you and I have the 
kind of lives that people would have if they lived out of a story. And mostly the story is 
constituted mostly by your reasons. But you got that job. That’s what happened.
JOHN
Normally I know that, but I wasn’t clear about that last night. It’s so easy to forget.

SPEAKING BEING
was “to manipulate his audience so as to secure agreement” 
(“Persuasion” 19). But a “turn” in Johnstone’s thinking led him 
to acknowledge by 1978 that “the distinction between finding 
the truth in philosophy and finding the proper rhetorical devices 
for propagating it cannot be maintained” (“Truth” 74). In other 
words, “truth” is always and already rhetorical, never severed 
from its communication, and thus finding the “truth” requires 
holding up a pretense that rhetoric is merely a convenient 
accessory that can be dispensed with.
 Johnstone’s new perspective of the philosophy–rhetoric 
relationship was based in the concept of evocation: “My present 
view is that a successful argument in philosophy is one that is 
intended to evoke, and does evoke, a response of a certain kind 
in the man to whom it is addressed” (“Truth” 75). Johnstone cited 
Heidegger as evidence for this view, and his description here of 
Heidegger’s language use is consistent with our understanding of 
both Heidegger’s and Erhard’s thinking:
ERHARD
That’s why we don’t give you anything to remember. You just have to be.
HANNAH
There’s a new babysitter watching the baby while I’m here and I got a note at the break to call
and I immediately felt terror because six months ago there was an accident that threatened his
life.
ERHARD
You understand that the terror is of no value to her? You sympathize with the terror. When you
leave here you’ll be a little more ruthless than you are now. You’ll be concerned for what em-
powers people, not for sympathizing with their weaknesses. No empowerment in terror.
HANNAH
I had lost closeness with him. It was more about clinging, and I saw that it was more about
terror.
ERHARD
Major issues like parenting or confronting death generate the most persistent stories. The things 
that are real close to us are hard not to be stupid about. It’s hard to be with that people do die.
And you are going to die. And that’s hard to be with. The more dramatic the soap opera is the
easier it is to get drawn into it and not be able to distinguish the story from what happened.
MAX
I’m here because I want my life to stop being an emergency, in my personal and professional 
life. I am an upset waiting to happen.
ERHARD
Some of you are an argument waiting to happen. You’re waiting for the occasion to act out the 
argument.
MAX
Turning away from my story to what happened is like becoming an arbitrator. It helps me get 
away from my guilt.
ERHARD
If guilt were useful, I would say have a lot of it. Listen up here! This is another one of those 
things you want to get. Feeling guilty makes it all right that you did something. If you didn’t feel 
guilty you’d be a bad person. That’s not terrible to be a bad person. No, it’s all right to do some-
thing as long as you feel guilty about it. Guilt is the salve we put on something that we did so
that we don’t have to be responsible for it. But you don’t know what I’m talking about because
you don’t know the diff erence between guilt and responsibility at this point. Max?
If I am correct in arguing that Heidegger 
conceives philosophy as basically rhetorical, 
some revision in our conception of rhetoric 
is called for. . . its purpose is not to incite its 
hearer to action—even the action of adopting 
some specific belief. Instead, rhetoric totally 
reorients the hearer; if he listens to it he is in 
a position to abandon an inauthentic life in 
favor of an authentic one. (“Rhetoric” 68)
“
On this view, the truth of philosophy is intimately infused with 
its communicability: “discovery, communication, and rhetoric all 
collapse into a unitary philosophical act” (“Truth” 76). Further, 
communicability is manifested as evocation: “The only way to tell 
whether what I have is a truth or a falsehood,” said Johnstone, “is 
to contemplate its evocative power.” And rhetoric, he added, is “the 
art of evocation” (“Truth” 76).
Finally, Johnstone’s discussion of Heidegger raises a third issue 
which will be particularly relevant in our analysis of The Forum: that 
is the question of the appropriate rhetorical style for addressing an

MAX
The story is that I joined the service, and went to Vietnam. And my welcome home isn’t what
I expected. What happened was, I went to war and came back alive. Same as any other war, 
there’s...it’s cleared up a lot of issues to look at it as what happened rather than my story in
relation to my coming home.
ERHARD (with emphasis)
Listen up! Vietnam’s a great, great story. Lot of people badly, badly fucked up by the story. Notice 
I didn’t say by what happened? Lots of people profoundly disabled by the story. Lot of freedom
for people to start to distinguish the story from what happened. Thanks Max.
Erhard shifted his tone, calling attention to the process they had been engaged in: they had devel-
oped a number of distinctions as tools for their inquiry.
ERHARD
We’re going to get these tools sharpened up as we proceed. Your questions are useful. You notice 
I’ve done most of what I’ve done out of people’s speaking. This is not a lecture, that’s why we 
call it The Forum. This is a dialogue. My job is to manage the dialogue, not to lecture. I have 
no pipeline to the truth. No one is asking you to believe anything that is said in here. But I’m 
asking you to think about it. That’s diff erent from “reject” or “accept” it. Instead, see what the
world looks like standing in that idea. It doesn’t matter whether you agree or not. To tell the
truth, I’m not that impressed with you yet, to care whether you agree or not. I do want to hear 
what you have to say. I’m not interested in your agreement or approval, or endorsement. I am
interested in you looking at what we’re saying here, to think about it yourself. And the way I’d 
like you to do that is to not judge it or evaluate it to see if it fi ts with what you already think. If 
I say anything that fi ts with what you already think, you shouldn’t be here. You can forget all 
that. Anything I say that fi ts with what you already think: that’s not The Forum. Only what I
say that doesn’t fi t with the stuff  you think, that provokes you to think and see things in a new 
way: that’s what’s valuable. But this isn’t the truth either. I don’t know about the truth. I know 
how to talk so that people have new possibility in their life. If you talk with me, you can bet that 
you’ll walk away with a new possibility in your life.
Now he introduced a new way to address what has already been the subject of the discussion.
ERHARD (continuing)
We’re going to talk about existence. That’s what we’ve been talking about. It’s hard to talk about. 
It’s hard to pick yourself up by your own bootstraps. It’s got to exist to talk about it. If you’re go-
ing to question existence—talk about existence—it’s got to exist to talk about it. The word for a 
concern for existence is ontology. And the reason I bring up that fancy sounding word is I want 
you to know The Forum is not psychological. Most people can’t tell the diff erence. Psychology 
is pervasive in our culture. The structure for interpretation for most people in this culture is psy-
chological. We’re all amateur psychologists. You see everything through a psychological lens.
untransformed audience whom one intends, through one’s rhetorical 
transactions, to transform. Johnstone stated the problem this way:
Heidegger’s entire position is specifically 
committed to the task of awakening phi-
listines from their ontological slumber 
. . . . Das Man [the “they,” the philistine, the 
untransformed] expects to be told in plain En-
glish what he can in fact come to understand 
only by being awakened. But because Heide-
gger’s entire thrust is toward the awakening 
of das Man he cannot reject as a mere philis-
tine the man who fails to understand him. In 
Heidegger’s own terms, he is not successful 
until he has reached the philistine. Hence in 
a sense there are no philistines at all for him. 
(“Rhetoric” 68) 
“
How does one awaken people from a debilitating slumber if 
they resist the process which is necessary for their awakening? 
This question, as we will show, is a central one for the rhetorical 
process of The Forum. ■
“ 
Only what I say that doesn’t fit with stuff  
you think, that provokes you to think and 
see things in a new way: that’s what’s
valuable.

ERHARD (pausing to wake a participant who was nodding off ) 
It’s okay to sleep in here if you can do it bolt upright with your eyes open. 
(returning to his topic)
Ontology is the diff erence between knowing how to play tennis and being a tennis player. They 
don’t teach this in school for the most part, and when they do, they do it badly for the most part.
An ontological approach—that is to say, a concern-for-being approach—has got a lot of room in
it because it’s something we haven’t engaged in very much. The point is, there’s a lot of room 
in a new realm. The psychological approach is one we’ve pushed really hard. And I want to be 
clear I’m not denigrating it. And that’s not our approach.
(moving to one of the blackboards) 
So far, we’ve distinguished two realms of existence. A phenomenon can exist in the realm of 
story and it can exist in the realm of what happened.
Erhard drew two circles on the board: in the left circle he wrote the word  “Story,” and in the right he
wrote “What Happened.”
ERHARD (indicating the left circle)
Max gave us a good example. There’s the story of Vietnam and that’s here. And there’s what
happened, and that’s here.
(indicating the right circle in which he wrote “what happened”)
We’re going to see what happens when you begin to distinguish these two. You’re going to see
the impact it has on your ability and state of being to distinguish Vietnam “the story” and Viet-
nam “the what happened.” You can apply the demonstration anywhere. We need to talk about 
thinking. Listen up. This is hard. Human beings have the notion that they think. Or—I might 
as well introduce this—they are that they think. They be like they’re thinking. And there is 
something happening. You and I call that “I think.” Here’s an exercise to tell if you’re thinking.
I’m going to shut up and you’re going to stop thinking.
(pausing for about fi fteen seconds)
You didn’t make it, did you? Nobody ever does, because it’s not you thinking. If you were
thinking then you could stop thinking. It is thinking, and you are having the thoughts it thinks.
t
Which is true? The old way of saying it or the way I said it? That’s not the point. I told you,
I don’t know the truth. I’m saying there’s something empowering about this, in the recogni-
tion that you don’t think. Like: “Hmm. I’m not thinking. It’s thinking, and I’m having those 
thoughts.” What comes up when you think this way is the possibility of actually thinking. 
Thinking is a process independent of those thoughts. Thinking is something like sitting with,
or more precisely something like dwelling in. It’s not like fi guring it out. You see, I asked you to
g
dwell in the possibility that it’s not you thinking.
(pausing again to address a number of people in the room who were getting sleepy) 
It always happens about now. Thinking about thinking puts you to sleep. Thinking wakes you
g
up. Thinking is when you have to break your mind—though not all of that is thinking. Some of 
it is bullshit.
“ 
It is thinking, and you are having the thoughts
t
it thinks. . . . Thinking is something like
sitting with, or more precisely something like
dwelling in. It’s not like figuring it out.

Forum Day One: Session Two
39
(turning to The Forum Supervisor) 
Julie, would you ask Eric to get the Heidegger books out of my room.
(returning to the blackboard, and pointing to the circle labeled “story”)
I want to take back making this bad. What’s disempowering is not the story, what’s disempow-
ering is when you collapse “what happened” with the “story” and you can’t distinguish the story 
from what happened. You can’t distinguish because you’ve got this mush, this mess, this swamp
of what happened and the story mixed together. The two need to be distinct. What does distinct 
mean? It means existing then on their own, being there of themselves. It’s possible for Vietnam 
to exist as a story and it’s possible for Vietnam to exist as a what happened. They’re two distinct 
realms of existence. Sometimes the story is appropriate, sometimes what happened is appropri-
ate. What’s never appropriate is when these two distinctions get collapsed.
As this conversation developed, Erhard added other terms to his blackboard model. In the right
circle, below “what happened,” he wrote “presence” and “I’m late.” In the other, below “story,” was 
written “concept” and “reasons.”
ERHARD
Confusing what happened with your story about it is like ordering steak and then mixing the
steak with the menu. Most people think life is sour because they’ve been eating the menu for 
so long, they don’t recognize reading the menu. You should not say “I love you” to people. You 
should say, “I live with the concept ‘I love you.’” Love as a concept is sometimes important, but
t
it isn’t the same as love as a presence. What falls out of my mouth when I say “chair” is a con-
cept. It’s not a chair—but it’s useful. Just separating the two domains of existence in any area of 
your life will leave you with more power in that area. For this to work, try it on in your own life. 
This is not the truth. Try it on. If it works, good; if not, throw it away.
At this point, The Forum Supervisor brought Erhard a copy of Heidegger’s What is Called Thinking? 
(1968, pages 76-77). He spent a minute looking for the passage he wanted, and fi nally turned back 
to her.
ERHARD
This is the wrong copy. This is not the copy I can fi nd things in. I have two marked copies and I 
can fi nd things in one and not the other.
Julie brought up the correct copy.
ERHARD (beginning to read)
“People still hold the view that what is handed down to us by tradition is what in reality lies 
behind us—while in fact it comes toward us because we are its captives and destined to it.”
(pausing)
We think we’re out in front of tradition on the leading edge. He’s talking about where the rub-
ber meets the road. This is not some fancy talk.

He’s talking about your future. He’s saying you’ve got no future. Your future is constituted by 
the past. Listen up! This is not a guy in a diner, by the way.
(shifting tone)
Where’s the person I had that conversation with?
Doris, with whom he had earlier discussed whether she knew her “ass from a hole in the ground,” 
stood.
ERHARD
Did I leave you insulted, by the way?
(Doris looking hesitant) 
Can I withdraw the insult? Will you forgive me? 
(nodding, she then sits)
Thank you.
(continuing to read)
“The purely historical view of tradition and the course of history is one of those vast self-de-
ceptions in which we must remain entangled as long as we are still not really thinking. That
self-deception about history prevents us from hearing the language of the thinkers. We do not 
hear it rightly, because we take that language to be mere expression, setting forth philosophers’
views.”
(to the group)
Some people are actually thinking, and speaking their thinking. That’s diff erent from “saying 
g
what you’ve got on your mind.” But the thinkers’ language tells what it is. And hearing it is in
no case easy. Hearing it presupposes that we meet a certain requirement, and we do so only on
rare occasions. So there’s a requirement to be able to hear thinking. And you can bet your hat, 
ass, and overcoat that the same requirement exists for thinking. And here’s the requirement.
(continuing to read)
“We must acknowledge and respect it. To acknowledge and respect consists in letting ev-
ery thinker’s thought come to us as something in each case unique, never to be repeated,
inexhaustible.”
(to the group)
You will notice that everything that has been said in here today you have associated with
something else. In order to have it live by itself, you have to think. Association happens anyhow,
because you’re not doing it. It’s doing it.

“—and being shaken to the depths by what is unthought in his thought.”
(to the group)
It’s like what is unsaid, but there by virtue of what is said. Anything that’s going to make a dif-
ference will be unsaid. Did you ever care about speaking in such a way that what you didn’t say 
was present? Probably not. But that’s where making a diff erence lies. 
(continuing to read)
“What is unthought in a thinker’s thought is not a lack inherent in his thought. What is un-
thought is there in each case only as the un-thought. The more original the thinking, the richer
will be what is unthought in it. The unthought is the greatest gift that thinking can bestow.”
(to the group)
Listen up real good to this part!
(continuing to read)
“But to the commonplaces of sound common sense, what is unthought in any thinking always 
remains merely the incomprehensible. And to the common comprehension, the incompre-
hensible is never an occasion to stop and look at its own powers of comprehension, still less to 
notice their limitations. To the common comprehension, what is incomprehensible remains 
forever merely off ensive...”
(to the group)
Where Heidegger uses the word “off ensive,” I say “it’s bullshit.” It’s a little clearer the way I say 
it, isn’t it? It’s more rigorous the way he says it, but it’s a little easier to get the way I say it.
(continuing to read)
“—proof enough to such comprehension, which is convinced it was born comprehending
everything, that it is now being imposed upon with an untruth and a sham. The one thing of 
which sound common sense is least capable is acknowledgment and respect.”
(to the group)
The distinction I’m developing between the story and what happened is not the commonsense
understanding. Love as a concept is what you and I live with most of the time, not love as a
presence. If you uncollapse the domains, you can have presence and story. It’s not worth a 
damn if you don’t map it onto your own life. Take something you’re concerned about—and by 
concern I don’t mean something you’re worried about. Take something you care about.
As the time for the second break of the day approached, Erhard moved to  another topic.
ERHARD (continuing)
We’re now going to talk about promises. There are certain promises you must make in order 
to participate in The Forum. You didn’t know that. This is a change! An occasion for upset! It’s 
very hard to talk about promises to people who don’t know what a promise is. Who you are is a 
“ 
Did you ever care about speaking in such a
way that what you didn’t say was present?
Probably not. But that’s where making a
diff erence lies.

If justifi cation equals doing it, when you don’t have a justifi cation for not doing it, then you
have to do it.

That’s a little sophisticated for us today.

ERHARD
You do what you feel like, or what is convenient, but you justify it so you can be right.

Diogenes looked for an honest man. I want to fi nd someone who is late. I’m fi fty-four years old 
and I’ve never found anyone who’s just late. It’s always “I’m late” plus the reason. By the way,
(pointing to the “what happened” circle) 
here’s “I’m late”...
(pointing to the “story” circle) 
...and here’s the reason. Being late is in a totally diff erent realm than the reason for being late.
And the two are not related. “I’m late” and the reasons arise in diff erent realms of existence. 
They’re apples and oranges. They don’t go together.

ERHARD
I apologize.
PARTICIPANT
Yeah, sure.
ERHARD
Is that like “fuck you”? Do you mean “I don’t feel apologize”? I’m not my feelings. I’m my 
mouth. You’re not your mouth. You say “okay” when you mean “Fuck you.”
PARTICIPANT
Not always.
ERHARD
You did that time.
PARTICIPANT 
That’s true.
Throughout this interaction Erhard’s style was relaxed but direct.
ERHARD (to the group)
The truth is that whether you keep your word depends on how you feel. Create this possibility: 
that you present yourself as someone who keeps your word, but in fact does or does not depend-
ing on whether you feel like it. Try on that possibility. “Honor your promise” means something 
like keep them in spite of the circumstances. Try on this possibility: that you present yourself as
f
someone who keeps your word, but in fact are someone who does or does not keep your word 
depending on whether you feel like it. Try that on. I say that if you do that you will have the 
freedom to honor your word. I know more about lying than most people in this room. I’ve lied 
more than most people in this room, and I know the kind of life it gives. And it’s my observation
that you’re never going to be able to honor your word until you can be with yourself in the way 
in which I just accused you of being. I say that until you can be with that, you can’t honor your 
word. By the way, I want to introduce a phrase here: that would be called being authentic about 
being inauthentic. Who doesn’t get this?
MARY 
I know that sometimes I won’t keep my word.
ERHARD
But you don’t present yourself as that.

You say, “Hey Werner, I’m going to meet you tomorrow at noon...”
MARY
And I’ll get there at two.
ERHARD
But you don’t say, “But Werner, I may show up and I may not.”
MARY
No.
ERHARD
That’s the inauthenticity. If you went around saying to people, “Look, I’ll give my word, and
maybe I’ll keep it and maybe I won’t.” Nothing inauthentic about that—that’s quite straight.

And I’m right about that.

We’ll discuss more about that later. You get what I mean about that being inauthentic? Anybody

You’re not confused; you’ve got something going on.

Getting It and Losing It
The Forum content is communicated through the gradual 
development of a series of distinctions. These distinctions off er 
access to a certain way of being; they are ontological clearings, 
contexts of meaning. They shape the way the circumstances of 
life occur so that a new way of being with those circumstances 
arises naturally. The new way of being becomes a possibility when 
the distinction is “gotten”—in Heideggerian terms, in a moment 
of Augenblick, or ontological insight. Thus the purpose of The 
Forum is to have participants “get” the distinctions deeply enough 
during the course of the four days that they leave The Forum 
dwelling in those distinctions. As Erhard told The Forum leaders 
during a debriefing, “What makes a diff erence is that there is a 
conversation generated that distinguishes the distinction, and that 
they’re dwelling in the conversation,” that is, they are “used by” 
the distinction rather than caught up trying to remember a piece of 
information as a precondition to being able to apply it.

What have you got going on?

I’m one of those people who stood up that said I’m a person of my word.
ERHARD
And you’re not. Isn’t that true? You do what you say you’re gonna do?
JAKE
I damn well try.
ERHARD
Very good. “I am a person who will do what I say I am going to do, when in fact, I am only a 
person who will try to do what I said I will do, and what I mean by try is, given the way I see 
things, which will be generated by my feelings, my mood, if I can see that I can’t do it, I won’t
do it. But I’m not gonna tell you that. I’m going to tell you that I’m a person of my word.”
Erhard sat on the edge of the platform facing Jake.
ERHARD (continuing)
Try to sit down.
(Jake sat) 
No, you sat down.
(Jake stood)
I didn’t say sit down. Try to sit down.
(again he sat)
No, you’re sitting. I said try to sit.
JAKE
I’m not getting it.
ERHARD
You’re getting it. You don’t like it. Trying to sit down looks a lot like standing up. You’re just a 
bullshit artist. That’s not a bad thing to be, by the way. It’s just a thing with no power.
JAKE
I’m getting that, but I don’t see the point. What is it worth?
The Heideggerian notion of “dwelling” is central to the way 
in which The Forum material is to be assimilated. Dwelling, for 
Erhard, is synonymous with “coming from”—that is, to dwell 
in a context is to come from that context into one’s life, or to 
allow oneself to be given being by that context. Heidegger 
called dwelling “the basic character of Being in keeping with 
which mortals exist” (“BDT” in PLT 158). Dwelling, for Heidegger, 
designates that ontological state in which we attain our essential 
relatedness to the world, so we must “think for the sake of 
dwelling” (“BDT” in PLT 159).
However, a point that we will introduce here and to which 
we will return throughout this book, is that Being withdraws. The 
ontological communication of The Forum, the speaking of Being, 
occurs always in this precarious context: it wavers on the brink 
of concealment. Thus the process of dwelling-in-a-distinction 
consists of repeatedly “getting” and “losing” that distinction. 
Erhard consistently tells his audiences that if they “got it and it 
went away,” that is the appropriate way to assimilate ontological 
communication: “That’s the way it’s supposed to happen,” he says, 
“getting and losing and getting and losing and getting and losing” 
(“Beyond the Winning Formula”). This is an essential aspect of the 
ontological rhetoric whose nature we are developing here, and it is 
consistent with the authors’ own experience of having participated 
in Werner Erhard’s programs: the insights that we have attained in 
the process have occurred waveringly.
As we have participated over the years in courses and 
seminars based in Erhard’s work, something would oft en be 
said which in that instant produced an illuminating insight, but 
which seemed, a moment or an hour later, to be simply words, 
or even incomprehensible jargon. Longitudinally, however—over 
the years of our participation in this work—we are aware of a 
parallel development: a gradually increasing dwelling-in the way 
of being that has been opened up by the distinctions which we are 
simultaneously getting and losing. Further, this ongoing dwelling-
in has, over the years, become more salient than the getting 
and losing. That is, we notice that we increasingly act from the

ERHARD
Let me tell you something, my friend. You’re not going to get anything out of here you can do 
something with. Do you think I’m going to give an asshole tools? What you walk out of here 
with will give you freedom. You won’t use it. It will use you. I have read all the books, and I’ve 
gotten value; but that’s not transformational.
JAKE
I don’t know where you’re coming from with this asshole stuff . 
ERHARD
It’s not because you are one. I don’t call you an asshole because it’s an apt description. I call you 
that because it has an impact. If I wanted to call you the right name I’d call you Jake.
JAKE
I’m doing a good job as I listen to you, as we talk about keeping your word and things like that. I’m 
aware of the burden I infl ict on myself with trying to keep my word.
ERHARD
And you see, when you walk out of here, you will be free to be your word. There will be no
burden in your word. Not bad. It’s worth something isn’t it? But you haven’t the remotest clue
about how to get there. You couldn’t get there in a billion years. Now we need you to get there,
but you’re stuck in this area. So that’s my business.
(laughter)
If I need someone in your business to do something, I don’t come to me, because I’m an asshole
in your business. You aren’t going to know when this is working and when it’s not working.
You wouldn’t know if we were there if we fell over it, because you look for the wrong kind of 
evidence. Stop worrying about whether it’s working. That’s my job. I don’t mean to attack your 
sincerity. Your sincerity is not worth attacking, because it’s worthless.
JAKE
That almost sounded like an apology.
ERHARD  (looking out at the group)
Your sincerity is worthless because you’re still standing when you try to sit down. Now, I’ve got
to live with your standing, not with your trying. This is like a cult of assholes.
JAKE
It sounds like you’re condoning being a real sloppy person about your word. 
ERHARD
That’s what hooked you, isn’t it? 
way-of-being made available by the distinctions of Erhard’s work; 
that way-of-being is the ontological “place” we come from into the 
encounters of our lives. 
Two significant qualifications must be added here. First, we 
have generalized what has been produced by our participation 
in Erhard’s work as “a way of being.” This is of course a gloss on 
an existential phenomenon that defies capture by words. On the 
one hand we sense, in our recent experiences in the seminars of 
Landmark Worldwide, what we might call reverberations that are 
harmonic with our earliest experiences of Erhard’s work. At the 
same time, since each of us is the way of being whose evolution we 
are addressing, we obviously have no place to stand outside that 
evolution from which to address it.
Second, these years have included years when we have 
participated regularly and frequently in Erhard’s work, and years 
when we have not participated at all. Our assessment of this 
process is that our experience of life has been enhanced during 
those periods of participation. Certainly there have been ups 
and downs in every period; but the phenomenon that Erhard 
calls transformation does indeed live in language, and it is our 
experience that regular participation in the conversation keeps 
it alive. And for us, even in the nonparticipating periods, the 
development of the distinctions remains ongoing just in the 
process of life itself.
 Thus the purpose of The Forum is to communicate the 
distinctions repeatedly and at suff icient length such that 
participants can move, as far as possible, from getting them to 
dwelling in them. “Why we’re going on and on down there,” Erhard 
told The Forum leaders during a debriefing session, “is so that 
the distinctions are transferred from something people get to 
something they come from.”
Therefore, we request that readers consider this possibility in 
approaching the ideas in this book. If something we say seems, at 
one moment, to make sense, but upon further reflection doesn’t, 
that may be the way it should be assimilated.
For the senior author, the point which Erhard was making 
at this particular juncture of The Forum—that I present myself as

Yep.
ERHARD
It sounded like I was attacking one of your sacred beliefs. You couldn’t tolerate being a guy who
said he would do it and didn’t do it. You couldn’t listen to the rest of what I said, and got con-
fused. You can’t live with being a guy who doesn’t keep his word.
JAKE 
I think I have good reasons for not doing it.
ERHARD
I didn’t say it wasn’t a valid story. I love everybody’s story. But you can’t ask about it, “true” or 
“false”? Is it really true that you couldn’t do it? What’s true is that you
t
didn’t do it. Sometimes a
t
cigar is just a cigar, as Freud said. Listen, you can’t be with that. You can’t be with the possibility 
of not being your word. And you know what? Something happened, when you were a kid, and 
you couldn’t be that anymore.
JAKE
This is something I value.
ERHARD
I know. You’re nutty about it.
JAKE
Yes I am a nut about it.
ERHARD
And anything you’re nutty about you have no freedom with.
JAKE
What’s the value in being two hours late just because you want to be two hours late?

I never said anything like that. You said that. You’re so nutty you’re hearing voices. That’s part 
metaphorical and part literal.
JAKE
No, somebody did say that.
MARY
I said that, but I didn’t say I wouldn’t try.
someone who keeps my word, whereas in reality I keep my word 
when I cannot justify not keeping it—wavers for me as I consider 
it. I see its validity: I do keep my promises and adhere to my 
agreements, but only until I see some overriding justification for 
breaking them. I obey most laws—my social contracts—except 
for certain laws which I justify not keeping: for example, I cannot 
personally justify cheating on my income tax returns, but I oft en 
justify exceeding the speed limit. The classic ethical dilemma—
whether one would tell an axe murderer the “truth” about the 
location of his innocent quarry—can be seen as a variation of this 
same point: I tell the truth until I can justify not telling it.
And yet I notice my resistance to accepting this when it is 
put so baldly. Protestations of my “honesty” leap to mind: it is 
not that I keep my word depending on how I feel about it, it is 
that I always keep my word except when there is some overriding 
reason not to. But—and here is the point Erhard is driving 
toward—isn’t that simply the same “what happened” with a 
diff erent “story” attached to it? Isn’t it true that I either keep my 
word or I don’t, and then I add a story, a justification of some 
nature for whichever action I take? Doesn’t the “what happened” 
remain unaltered, regardless of the explanation or justification I 
attach to the event?  ■

In some languages making promises sometimes involves using a special tense that says you

When I arrive, if I do...
PAUL
It’s characteristic of other languages. In Spanish there’s all these subjunctive tenses. You can
say: “When you do this for me, then I’ll do that.” It’s subjunctive, it’s something we don’t recog-
nize in our language. It’s recognized as theoretical. Maybe that’s what you’re getting at.
ERHARD
No it’s not, but what you’ve said is useful nevertheless for what I am getting at: that you will 
present yourself as a person who will do what you said you will do, and you don’t do what you 
say you will do. In fact maybe you will do it and maybe you won’t. That’s inauthentic.

I have a lot of respect for people who speak several languages. I don’t mean any disrespect, but
it doesn’t mean you know shit about language. 
PAUL
Well, language encompasses a pattern of thought, a process of thought. It’s contained within
the language you think within. Like I was referring to with Spanish, you have within the lan-

things are real...

JAKE
It doesn’t make it authentic, but it doesn’t make me dishonest. It doesn’t make me a liar either.
ERHARD  (to the group) 
I’m taking all this time with this bullshit because I want to accomplish something. No mat-
ter what I bring up, somebody will have a thing about it. Somebody will be nutty about it. No 
matter what they’re saying, it’s obvious these two guys are intelligent. But they’ve got their foot
nailed to the fl oor, so it’s like talking to stupid people. Being stuck makes you stupid. There’s no 
power available where you’ve got your foot nailed to the fl oor. All this conversation regarding
intention, in response to my simple statement about authenticity, indicates that there’s some 
nuttiness there. The point is, at some point, you will be that person.
(to Jake)
And to settle this conversation: I ask you to stand in—that a person who presents himself one 
way, and in fact acts another way, for any reason, is inauthentic. That’s not true. It’s a “take the
case that” I’m asking you to stand in. Is that clear?

There’s no power available where you’ve got
your foot nailed to the floor.

Jake nodded and then sat down.
ERHARD (to Paul)
Did you get what I said to him?
PAUL
Yeah, so, what you’re saying is that specifi c instance you didn’t do what you said, you’re inau-
thentic, and I would agree with you there, but...
ERHARD
I don’t want your agreement. I want you to create this square.
 
(drawing an imaginary square on the fl oor in front of Paul) 
Inside that square is a diff erent world. Inside that world, when you act one way and present
yourself another way, that’s inauthentic.
PAUL
Specifi cally, or generally?
ERHARD
Generally. Just in that world. It’s not true in the rest of the world. Can you handle that?
PAUL
Yeah. I’m not sure what it applies to, but...
ERHARD
It doesn’t apply to anything. Can you handle that?
PAUL
Yeah.
ERHARD
Stand in that square and listen to what I say next. Because only standing there will what I’m
about to say make any sense. All right? You ready to stand in that square?
(to Paul)
You ready? So in that little square, I know it’s not true, and it’s not that way in the rest of the
world, and for those for whom one and one is two, when you pretend to be one way and act
another, that’s called inauthentic. When you own up to this, that’s being authentic about your 
inauthenticity. Anybody not get that? That’s the beginning of authenticity. Authenticity does not 
AUTHENTICITY
Here Erhard provides a counterintuitive, but very Heideggerian 
premise: authenticity is possible only with the development 
of an authentic relationship with our own inauthenticity. Here 
authenticity is an act of ownership, of owning the calculative 
clearing which we are, of accepting the particular gift  of Being 
whose sending characterizes our epoch. Heidegger introduced 
this idea in Being and Time, where he employed the term 
“resoluteness” to characterize Dasein’s state of having-
appropriated; he described this resoluteness as an empowering 
authenticity toward one’s own inauthenticity: 
Resoluteness appropriates untruth authen-
tically. Dasein is already in irresoluteness, 
and soon, perhaps, will be in it again. . . . The 
irresoluteness of the “they” remains domi-
nant, notwithstanding, but it cannot impugn 
resolute existence. (BT 345)
“
This idea lies at the heart of the appropriative event: in 
the context of having appropriated one’s inauthenticity, that 
inauthenticity, which persists, is nevertheless transformed. 
It is an idea which defies our usual thinking: ontically, such a 
“transformation” can only be seen as blatant self-justification, a 
philosophically sophisticated rationalization for accepting one’s 
worst nature. Ontologically, however, appropriation justifies 
nothing. Appropriation appropriates; it gives Being. Resoluteness, 
then, is “the opening up of human being, out of its captivity in 
that which is, to the openness of Being” (“OWA” in PLT 67). Much 
of The Forum is devoted to developing the possibility of a non-
justificatory event of appropriation. ■

begin with being authentic. Authenticity begins with being authentic about your inauthenticity. 
If you’re ever going to have any degree of authenticity the only way to get there is to start with
being authentic about your inauthenticity.
(to the group)
I’m not interested in your belief systems, I’m not interested in your values, I’m not interested in
your principles. So no more conversations like I just had with Jake and Paul. I don’t mean don’t
say anything, I mean don’t preach. I’ll do all the preaching in here, and if I’m any good, I won’t
do any either. All I’m asking when I talk to you about the things I’m talking about is: build
a square, stand inside of it, look out at life and the world and see what you can see standing
in that square and standing in that possibility. If it empowers you to stand there, keep it. If it
doesn’t empower you to stand there, destroy it. Simple.
BELLA
You said to someone else that something happened when they were a child. I remembered. My 
father was a liar, and I decided I could never be that. I had to be honest. I’ve had no freedom to 
keep my word.
ERHARD
You can’t be anything you’re forced to be. Anything you are forced to be, you aren’t.
BELLA
I couldn’t stand the feeling.
ERHARD
Yeah.
(to the group)
Who couldn’t stand being a liar?
(several raise their hands)
You think a truth teller would fi nd lying absolutely abhorrent? For the person who tells the
truth you don’t have any problem with a lie, it’s only somebody down in the swamp, in the bot-
tom of the Valley of the Shadow of Death, who is afraid they might be a liar. I know you know 
better.
BELLA
I am a liar.
ERHARD
Yeah. You are a liar. That’s being authentic about being inauthentic. And that’s the beginning of 
authenticity—and the beginning of the freedom to tell the truth.
“ 
All I’m asking when I talk to you about the 
things I’m talking about is: build a square,
stand inside of it, look out at life and the 
world and see what you can see standing in
that square and standing in that possibility.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (to the group)
I know most of you don’t get that, but never mind. Just listen. What today and tomorrow is
about mostly is about being authentic about being inauthentic. So there are a couple of things
to get. One: you present yourself as someone who keeps your word, but in fact you are someone
who does or does not keep your word depending on whether you feel like it. Is that the truth
about you? I told you I don’t know the truth. See if it’s empowering—like trying on a robe. 
Two: when you can wear that robe, that’s called being authentic about your own inauthenticity.
Always, the beginning of authenticity is being authentic about your own inauthenticity. I want 
you to treat the promises in here diff erently from usual. I want you to say “regardless.” When it’s 
all over, maybe you will, maybe you won’t. Sincerity is pure story. I’m asking you to engage in 
these promises as a matter of integrity, not sincerity. As a matter of fact, standing in the back-
ground is always the possibility that you may not. But then you won’t, and that’s that.
At 3:12 pm, The Forum adjourned for a second break.

SPEAKING BEING
Dasein: Meaning and Mineness
Dasein is Martin Heidegger’s name for the central figure in his 1927 magnum opus, 
Being and Time. The term is one of the few in Heidegger’s writing that consistently 
remains untranslated from the German: the most literal translation of Da-Sein is be-
ing-there. Scholar Hubert Dreyfus suggests that the best way to understand Dasein 
is to think of “our term ‘human being,’ which can refer to a way of being that is char-
acteristic of all people or to a specific person—a human being” (Hubert L. Dreyfus, 
Being-in-the-World 14). 
But the term being-there itself indicates the essential characteristic that distin-
guishes humans from other beings. Dasein is being-there because it is the only being 
for whom its Being is an issue. Humans are the beings who reflect upon themselves, 
and the only ones who exist in a world of meaning. We dwell in a meaningful “there,” 
and we bring our “there” along with us when we show up. Other beings inhabit the 
earth; human beings live in a world. 
This is a challenging and essential aspect of the thinking Heidegger is devel-
oping here, and a distinction that emerges persistently over the four days of The 
Forum. The meanings of the things in our world are not properties of the things 
themselves. Non-human beings are “entities whose kind of Being is of a charac-
ter other than Dasein’s,” and therefore they must be understood as “unmeaning, 
essentially devoid of any meaning at all” (BT 193). When Heidegger says that “only 
Dasein can be meaningful or meaningless,” he is saying that other beings can have or 
lack meaning only when they are encountered by Dasein and are thereby disclosed as 
meaningful or not (BT 192–193). Consider: a dog may not be “a dog” for another dog, 
nor may the dog see “beauty” in a sunset. Dasein is the only being in whose world 
there is meaning. Only for human beings do things show up as the things they are.
Further, Dasein is the only being for whom existence is always an issue, and the 
issue for each Dasein is always fundamentally its own existence. Heidegger calls this 
human characteristic mineness: the Being of human beings, while it characterizes 
the ontological nature of the collective, always occurs as the Being of a particular 
human being. Therefore, while Dasein is not a person, we have to talk about it as if 
it were: “Because Dasein has in each case mineness, one must always use a personal 
pronoun when one addresses it: ‘I am,’ ‘you are’” (BT 68). 
Each Dasein relates to this existential situation in a particular way. “Mineness 
belongs to any existent Dasein, and belongs to it as the condition which makes 
authenticity and inauthenticity possible” (BT 78, emphasis added). That is, my 
SESSION TWO INTERVAL
Dasein is always mine, but whether or not that relationship is authentic—as Werner 
Erhard would put it, whether I own the condition of mineness, or whether it owns 
me—depends upon an act of existential choice. The purpose of The Forum is to 
bring participants face-to-face with that choice, thereby making available the possi-
bility of authentic existence.

SPEAKING BEING
The Forum resumed at 4:00 pm. Erhard was not present for this session. During 
the first half-hour, The Forum Supervisor, Julie, oversaw a procedure that took 
place in every Forum (but is currently not practiced in The Landmark Forum): 
participants raised their hands, section by section, to request rides or places to stay 
during the four days of The Forum, and other participants responded with offers. 
This process having been completed, Kipp came onto the platform. He introduced 
himself and Wes as the two Forum leaders who would be leading The Forum with 
Erhard, and then turned to the next order of business: the promises and requests 
of The Forum, which Erhard had mentioned earlier in the day. Julie, the Course 
Supervisor, came forward. 
JULIE
We’re asking you to give your word—to make certain promises—and to keep 
your word—to keep the promises.
The required promises:
(1) Regarding speaking in The Forum: Raise your hand, speak into the micro-
phone. Don’t talk to each other during The Forum.
(2) Wear your name tag at all times. Get the name on the tag correct.
(3) Take no notes. No tape recorders or cameras, no busy work at your chair, 
no food/drink in the room. Exception: Forum leaders may take notes.
(4) You agree to maintain the confidentiality of The Forum. This includes 
names of participants and their remarks. Keep in mind that confidentiality in 
a group of this size cannot be guaranteed.
(5) Regarding videotaping: if you didn’t earlier sign a video release, sit in the 
no-video section.
(6) No resale agreement. All materials in this program are the property of 
Werner Erhard and Associates, in some instances protected by copyright. 
You agree not to resell, modify, package, and deliver in a seminar, training 
program, workshop, consulting, or similar business activity. This protection 
extends beyond the copyright law.
(7) Informed consent. The Forum is not therapeutic in design or intent. Forum 
leaders are not trained mental health professionals. A series of questions was 
included about participant’s status with regard to therapy. If you’re in therapy 
and winning, advise your therapist. If not, or if you’ve been hospitalized for 
drug or alcohol abuse, we recommend you don’t take The Forum. In the form 
you signed earlier there is a list of emotions which may come up during The 
Forum; if you find them threatening, don’t take the Forum. If you have a prob-
lem dealing with stress, don’t take The Forum. Certain medical conditions and 
certain drugs are also listed in this category. This informed consent is intended 
to have legal significance.
FORUM DAY ONE: SESSION THREE
KIPP
Are there any questions regarding the ground rules?
PARTICIPANT
What are the reasons for the rules?
KIPP
Everything that we design is not meant to suppress you. It’s meant to provide 
maximum possible benefit for you from The Forum. 
PARTICIPANT
I’d like to know why we’re spending so much time on logistics. I’m angry.
(applause from some of the group)
KIPP
So you have no question? Thanks.
Following the required rules, an opportunity to leave was announced. No one did. 
KIPP
Your sitting in your chair is a promise, and we will relate to you on the basis 
that you have given your word. 
JULIE  (continuing to read the recommended promises)
(1) Be present for all sessions. We recommend that you be on time in the 
morning and back from breaks. If you miss any part of any Forum session, you 
forfeit the right to expect the results of The Forum.
(2) Do not consume drugs and medications—including alcohol, aspirin, mar-
ijuana, but not including those prescribed by your doctor—before the end of 
the fourth day of The Forum.
(3) Stay awake during The Forum. Staying awake is easier if you don’t slouch 
or slump in your chair. If you get sleepy, we recommend that you sit straight 
in the chair with your eyes open.
KIPP
A distinction has started to open up in the room: I’ll try vs. I’ll keep my promis-
es. This distinction was not merely about words. We’re not asking you to speak 
a certain way. We’re showing you a distinction of an empowering way to be 
with promises.

way, a way you’re going to have to invent rather than discover. Namely, what 
you’re willing to put at stake. You can’t ever find something at stake. You can 
only invent it, create it. It’s a creative act, it’s a self-generated challenge which 
you create for yourself. And that’s who you are for The Forum. Some of the 
tools you need for this we haven’t developed in here yet. The first place you 
will look is at what’s wrong with you. Let that be. This is confusing because 
it requires real thinking. Your reasons got you here but they are no longer 
sufficient. During the meal break, I invite you to create what you’re willing to 
put at stake.
(pausing)
This works. We’re not wondering anymore whether The Forum works. We’re 
promising you that you can have anything you are willing to stand for having 
gotten in The Forum. And the access to that is your willingness to put yourself 
at stake here in The Forum. This requires speaking. You speak yourself in the 
matter. The first action which it requires is speaking, speaking what you’re 
putting at stake. And the second part is to promise to be your word. Have a 
conversation with others at dinner about this: if your life were an expression, 
what would that expression be? The Forum won’t provide you with what’s 
possible out of a reason for being here. At-stakeness is something that exists 
the moment you create it as a possibility. What we’re asking you to do is to 
begin to create your life. What you’re willing to stand for in here is what you 
have at stake. 
PARTICIPANT
What’s the difference between The Forum and positive thinking? 
KIPP 
Remember that “stop thinking” exercise we mentioned earlier? Try to make 
all those thoughts positive. It’s a difficult thing to do, trying to make some-
thing you have nothing to do with positive. Like, “Oh my God! There’s a bad 
thought! It’s supposed to be positive!”
(to the group)
During the meal break, you are to create what you are willing to put at stake 
like a possibility. Have a conversation with another person and with who you 
are going to have dinner with.
Following this discussion, Julie came onto the platform and announced a meal 
break at 6:20 pm.
JULIE  (continuing to read the suggested promises)
(1) Eat only during the one announced meal break. Eat a big breakfast.
(2) Don’t sit next to someone you knew before The Forum started.
(3) Advise us of the phone number where you’re staying this week. 
Assistants distributed phone information cards.
PARTICIPANT
Is gum chewing forbidden in The Forum? 
KIPP 
How many drops of pee does it take to spoil the stew? 
PARTICIPANT 
One.
KIPP 
Get it? 
PARTICIPANT
I know I should say yes. I know the group is the stew. Am I the pee?
KIPP
You’re at a moment of choice now.
(to the group)
What are some reasons for being in The Forum? 
PARTICIPANTS (several calling out)
So my speaking is a possibility for people; Because I know there’s more out 
there; etc. 
KIPP 
Now let’s hear some things you could fix from being in The Forum. 
Again, people called out answers, a series of standard benefi ts similar in quality to 
the fi rst group of responses. 
KIPP 
Neither of these provide you with what work The Forum has for you. A reason 
for being here, or something to fix, won’t provide you with what you need 
to be in The Forum. So we’re going to have to think of being here in a new

Yankelovich Study Results  
Prior to the delivery of The Forum presented in this book, Werner Erhard and Asso-
ciates (WE&A) commissioned a study by noted social scientist Daniel Yankelovich, 
SESSION THREE INTERVAL
wherein he analyzed the results reported by graduates of the course. By the time 
the results of the study were published, circa 1991, Erhard had sold WE&A to his em-
ployees, and that company today is called Landmark. Here is the summary of those 
results and Yankelovich’s analysis.
An Analysis of The Forum and Its Benefi ts 
A Yankelovich (DYG, Inc.) Study
Summary
Internationally recognized social scientist Daniel Yankelovich surveyed more than 1300 people who completed The
Forum during a three-month period. Prior to their course, people were asked what they expected to achieve in the 
course; after their course, they were asked about the benefits they actually received.
The study explored four areas: the value of The Forum, the profile of participants, satisfaction levels after The Forum, 
and unexpected benefits that were experienced. A few of the findings include:
 
•  More than 90% of participants report practical and enduring value for their life — well worth the time and 
cost.
 
•  More than 90% of participants report a better understanding of relationships and their role in them.
 
•  Nearly every participant received unexpected benefits — ranging from achieving personal and 
professional goals.
“Several of the study’s findings surprised me quite a bit, especially the large number of participants for whom The
Forum proved to be ‘one of the most valued experiences of my life.’ This is not a sentiment that people, particularly
successful, well-educated people, express lightly. I can understand why people recommend The Forum to their 
associates, friends, and relatives.”
Daniel Yankelovich, Chairman 
DYG, Inc. (public opinion analyst)
Daniel Yankelovich, Chairman of DYG, Inc., a noted social scientist and public opinion analyst, as well as a leading
researcher of values and future trends who has been conducting these kinds of studies for more than 30 years,
did an analysis of the survey.
The following charts indicate the value reported from The Forum, the benefits most often cited as a result of their
participation, and their level of satisfaction.
Daniel Yankelovich is a
leading interpreter of trends 
shaping American society
and the global economy. He 
is the author of 10 books
and chairman/founder of
three organizations: Public Agenda; DYG, Inc.; and 
Viewpoint Learning. His pioneering work has earned
him numerous awards in the field of public opinion
research.
“ More than 7 out of 10 found the 
course to be one of their life’s 
most rewarding experiences. 
To me, this suggests that it 
addresses many of people’s 
most profound concerns — 
to improve their personal 
relationships, how to be a more 
effective person, how to think 
productively about their lives 
and goals.”

Value of  The Forum
The degree of value to which participants
felt the course had in the areas listed below:
Satisfaction Levels
The degree to which The Forum fully
met the expectations of those attending 
for these reasons:
Unexpected Benefi ts
Nearly every participant in the Yankelovich survey reported
receiving some entirely unexpected benefits from The
Forum. These benefits ranged from specific educational to
business goals. Unexpected benefits were most frequently
noted in nine areas:
1. Greater confidence and self-esteem
2.  A new ability to express thoughts and feelings,
both publicly and privately
3. Job is more enjoyable and satisfying
4. Better relationships with co-workers
5. More comfortable and at ease with others
6.  Less concerned with the approval and opinion of others
7. Better relationship with parents and family members
8. Overcame a fear or anxiety
9. Have more fun in life
Profi le of Participants
These charts indicate the distribution of participants by age, educational level, and occupation. The greatest number of
participants are in their mid-twenties to mid-forties. On the whole, they are very well educated, with 87% indicating some
college work, well over half having completed college, and 20% holding postgraduate degrees. Participation is distributed
fairly evenly between women and men, and among married, single, and previously married adults.

Areas of Greatest Impact
Before attending the workshop, we asked participants to indicate areas where they felt they needed improvement. Very
few people felt they needed a great deal of improvement in many of the 68 areas we questioned. Yet after the workshop,
many participants realized that they could improve themselves and their job performance dramatically in ways they hadn’t 
considered before the workshop. The ranking below shows the areas where the workshop had the greatest impact.
Being able to acknowledge mistakes fully and do what is necessary
to correct them.
Being fully committed to my company’s success.
Having high standards of quality for myself and the people who 
work with me and for me.
Confronting difficult situations head-on instead of avoiding them.
Always listening carefully and attentively to other people at work.
Being as concerned with the performance of my department/division
and the company overall as I am with my own performance.
Always being responsive to the concerns of those who work for me.
Being quick to give recognition to others for the work they do.
Welcoming constructive criticism from others.
Being very effective in communicating work related issues with 
my co-workers.
Being good at letting other people get all the credit they deserve.
Feeling free to be frank and open with those who report to me.

7:50 pm: Erhard’s manner was light and casual as he opened this session, interrupted by a number 
of people who were returning late from the meal break. The first participant to stand shared that in 
looking for issues to put at stake, he found that his issues were already big enough and did not feel 
he needed to invent new ones. Erhard noticed an empty seat and began to manage people missing.

I made up my mind not to call you assholes any more, but I want you to know it’s very hard. 
Speaking about issues and what you can have at stake...
(drawing a large circle on the chalkboard) 
Let that circle represent everything there is to know. Everyone in The Forum is successful. We 
know from independent studies of The Forum that participants are above average in their abil-
ity to succeed. So a certain amount of what is in this circle you know, and you know that you 
know. 
(drawing a small wedge in the circle) 
What we do to be successful and able is we put what we know to use. That’s what common 
sense tells us to do with what we know that we know. But there is also some stuff that we don’t 
know, and know that we don’t know.
(adding a larger wedge) 
The older I’ve gotten, the more I know I don’t know. Common sense tells us that to find out 
what we know that we don’t know, we need to go to school, read a book, take a seminar. I’d 
like you to see that you really fit that. The rest of the pie is what you don’t know that you don’t 
know. What does common sense tell you to do about that? Nothing. Common sense is silent on 
that subject. What The Forum is about is what you don’t know that you don’t know—what’s 
behind you that you can’t see. The purpose of The Forum is to provide access to what you didn’t 
know that you didn’t know. In independent surveys, people have reported that The Forum is the 
single most dramatic learning experience in their life.
(drawing a point on the second chalkboard)
When you take a point, which has zero dimensions, and extend it into the first dimension, you 
get a line.
(drawing a line extending from the point)
You don’t get a bigger and better point. Then, when you extend the line into the second dimen-
sion, you don’t get a bigger and better line: you get a plane.
(drawing out from the line to form a square)
And when you extend a two-dimensional plane into the third dimension, you don’t get a bigger 
and better plane, you get a three dimensional figure, in this case, a cube.
(building from the square, Erhard drew a cube)
Almost invariably, the results of our life are results from extending ourselves on the same 
dimension. But adding a new dimension is an exponential leap. You want to listen up here and 
get this! The Forum doesn’t push out on the dimensions of living already available to you. What

it does is add a dimension. So there’s an exponential leap in the possibility of Being. And that’s 
maybe why there are these outrageous claims people make about what they got from participat-
ing in The Forum.
PARTICIPANT
Couldn’t you add a fourth slice to the pie? Intuition? What you know but don’t know that you 
know.
ERHARD
Yes, that’s very legitimate. You didn’t get the point about dimensionality?
(adding it to the model on the board)
In a point, you have no degrees of freedom. In a line, one dimension, you get one degree of free-
dom, and so on, and we simply expand on that one degree of freedom. The Forum adds a new 
dimension. You get an exponential leap of possibility. 
PARTICIPANT
It’s what you don’t know that you don’t know.
ERHARD
Exactly. 
PARTICIPANT
How do you get there?
ERHARD
You’re in here four days and one evening. You’ll see how it’s done by the end of the third day. 
Anybody else here not get this dimensionality? 
PARTICIPANT
Could you say that what The Forum does is to “unconceal” a new dimension?
ERHARD
Yes, that’s a technical term for it. It’s called unconcealing. What begins to get you into this 
domain of “don’t know that you don’t know” is to dwell in the power of the question. We’re 
hungry for answers, addicted to answers. People hate being in the question; they want the 
answer. You don’t get answers. Light gets shed on what you are concerned with. That’s not the 
way you and I are usually. The way you and I are is hungry for answers. What do I do about it? 
The beginning of gaining access to what you don’t know that you don’t know, the beginning of 
establishing a new dimension for being, a new dimension for living, is to start to dwell in the 
question, develop the courage and the stamina and the wherewithal to orient yourself around 
“ 
Can you formulate a question, the asking 
of which is empowering? So that you’d be 
willing to stay in the question?

questions the asking of which makes a difference. There are certain questions, just the asking of 
which impacts people’s ability in life. See, you and I don’t look for those questions, we look for 
answers, which you can only find in what you know that you don’t know. This is about devel-
oping questions the asking of which gives access to what you don’t know that you don’t know 
about your life, about other people, and about living. The Forum is about developing a certain 
muscle for asking questions the mere asking of which makes a difference.
Here Erhard read a passage from Heidegger’s On the Way to Language (page 13), in which Heidegger
recounts his dialogue with a Japanese scholar:
ERHARD (reading)
“Japanese: We Japanese do not think it strange if a dialogue leaves undefined what is really 
intended...”
(to the group)
That’s not very familiar to most of us, is it? In our dialogues we want to get definition very 
quickly. We want it explained.
(continuing to read)
“...or even restores it back to the keeping of the undefinable. 
Inquirer: That is part, I believe, of every dialogue that has turned out well between thinking be-
ings. As if of its own accord, it can take care that that undefinable something not only does not 
slip away, but displays its gathering force ever more luminously in the course of the dialogue.”
(to the group)
That means putting it back into “don’t know that you don’t know.” It’s a harmonic with what 
I read you earlier about the unspoken. See, what you’re looking for here is light, not answers. 
Insight you can’t create by the numbers. What you want if you’re going to create is light, not 
answers. Listen up, goddammit!
(continuing to read)
“Our dialogues with Count Kuki probably failed to turn out so well. We younger men chal-
lenged him much too directly to satisfy our thirst for handy information.”
(to the group)
You’re here listening for answers. You’re listening for what we call “tips.” Nothing worthwhile in life 
can be gotten there by ten steps. Or twenty steps. You can’t dance knowing where to put your feet.
(continuing to read)
“Inquirer: Thirst for knowledge and greed for explanations never lead to a thinking inquiry. 
Curiosity is always the concealed arrogance of a self-consciousness that banks on a self-invent-
ed ratio and its rationality.”
(to the group)
What that all means is that this greed, this thirst, the question, “How am I going to use this?”—
that’s a product, according to this guy, of a concealed arrogance, an arrogance that everything

in life that’s worth knowing is merely an extension of what I already know. But the truth is that 
everything worth knowing is going to violate what you know.
(continuing to read)
“The will to know does not will to abide in hope before what is worthy of thought.”
(to the group)
I think all there is, is having thoughts. But there are certain things that if you stand in front of 
them in a certain way, give you thinking. If you stand in front of things worthy of thought you 
get thinking. Thinking is a dance with that about which you are thinking. When you stand in 
front of questions worthy of thought, you get thinking. Now that’s tough, because we’re in the 
rainstorm called “I think.” We’re all Cartesians. No one’s had an original thought since then 
about thinking—at least not one that has gotten to you or me. You and I are still Cartesians. But 
there are possibilities beyond Descartes. And they give you access to a new way of being that 
you can’t get to—being the kind of person you already always are. We’re going to be thinking. 
That’s the way The Forum works. It goes backwards.
PARTICIPANT
What about disciplines that promise “inner transcendence”?
ERHARD
Inner transcendence. That’s what California is about. I don’t want to insult your pet project, 
but I am not a guy in a diner about getting someplace. And you aren’t going to get there leaping 
over being human. There’s no possibility of being beyond what you already always are until you 
own what you already always are. Californians don’t like that. Californians have this magical 
bullshit they believe in. That’s not the way The Forum works. The Forum’s got two pieces to it. 
The first is an inquiry into the already always being of human being. What kind of an opening 
are you for life? What’s the color of the clearing you are for life? To say that more rigorously: 
what is the already always condition of being for human beings? What did you get yourself 
into here? Not your individual version of being human. That’s the question of ninety percent of 
The Forum. That’s called going backwards. It’s about owning yourself as you already are. Being 
authentic about inauthenticity is particularly frightening for Californians. We don’t want to be 
inauthentic. Why? Because it looks bad. And I don’t like looking bad. And your life is about 
looking good. This is moving backwards to own what I already always am. This is not individ-
ualistic except that each of us has his or her own version, we got wet in this rainstorm called 
human being. What is it to be a human being? See, people don’t ask that question. They want to 
be thinner, younger, sexier. Those questions don’t give thinking. Because it is a question worthy 
of thought it creates the possibility of thinking.
The Forum is two questions. The first: what is the already always being of human beings? Being 
human owns you. It gives you your life. The second half of The Forum is another question. The 
second question is, what is the possibility of being for human beings? What’s possible beyond 
what I was given to be? I did what’s called in Zen the low road. In the low road you must do 
everything that doesn’t work. So I’m not a guy in a diner about the low road. Most people want 
“ 
There’s no possibility of being beyond what 
you already always are until you own what 
you already always are.

to start with the second question. But you can’t get to the possibility until you own what you 
already always are. The pathway—concrete, authentic, real—is to embrace what you already 
always are.
(pausing)
The problem is that if you move forward from where you are, all you’re doing is changing. The 
medium in which you create may be something, but the source of creation is nothing. I had the 
privilege of having a relationship with Dick Feynman, the physicist. He took one note the whole 
time I knew him: “There are certain things you can only know by creating them.” As a matter 
of fact, when he died that note was on his blackboard. That was just my best moment.
(pausing)
When I use the term possibility, I mean stuff in the dimension of “don’t know that you don’t 
know.” So that’s what The Forum is about. In the first question, you move backwards. And it 
begins with being authentic about your own inauthenticity. To the degree that you’re not able 
to be with your own inauthenticity, to that degree you are unable to be. Where’s Jake? I want 
to identify the conversation we were having. He’s a fine guy. And yet, I’m saying that there’s 
something possible in that area he has a lot of interest that is denied to him because he can’t be 
“I don’t do what I said I would do.” I didn’t say that was true about him. That’s not important. 
What’s important is that he can’t be there yet. Whatever you’re not able to be with won’t let you 
be. So the degree to which you are not able to be with your inauthenticity, to that degree you 
are prevented from being. You’re stuck being this, so there’s nothing else you can be. Or you’re 
stuck not being that, so there’s nothing else you can be except not that. You’re like a Johnny 
one-note “not-that.” Not-that is way more attached than have-to-be-that.
I get this as a dance. I’m uncomfortable. I don’t know where to put my feet. It’s extremely un-
comfortable to be in that “don’t know that you don’t know.”
ERHARD
So “don’t know that you don’t know” is uncomfortable. Ever jumped out of an airplane? It’s 
uncomfortable. It’s also a lot of fun. 
PARTICIPANT
I’m starting to ask myself, “what is worthwhile?”
ERHARD
That’s a great question: A question to live with. If you live with that question for the rest of your 
life, your life will have a quality that it won’t have without it. You ask the question for the light 
the question gives.
“ 
To the degree that you’re not able to be with 
your own inauthenticity, to that degree you
are unable to be.

PARTICIPANT
That’s just life.
ERHARD
It’s life in the fast lane. “The more things change the more they remain the same.” That’s true. 
And we’ll look at why that’s so.
PARTICIPANT
There’s fun in engaging with this even though I don’t know what I’m doing. 
ERHARD
I don’t know what I’m doing. Would you want to dance knowing what you’re doing? But in 
our culture, you’re not allowed not to know. It’s shameful not to know. It’s the way we already 
always are. There’s an opportunity to develop a certain relationship with not knowing in here 
that will give you a more powerful access to what is worth knowing. With me? Thanks.
(pausing)
I’m not going to call on anybody for a while. We’re going to introduce a new what-you-call 
subject. We’re going to introduce a new what-I-call distinction. When this is all over, you’ll call 
it that too. The distinction is concern. The usual meaning of concern is “worried about.” When I 
use the word concern I use it in a broader sense. You and I are constituted by a body of con-
cerns, kind of like what we attend to. 
Erhard drew an X on the chalkboard.
ERHARD  (continuing)
X is a symbol that represents one of your concerns. X could be “being related.”
(responding to a participant asking for clarifi cation)
It could be said that human beings are constituted by a body of concerns. The word constitutive 
means something more than “is a part of.” It means something like “gives the thing itself.” It’s 
like your concerns give you your self. 
PARTICIPANT
It gives the essence of my self...
ERHARD
You’ve got to watch because I’m going to say “no” to damn near everything you’re going to say, 
and everything you say is good, but it’s not quite it. We’re not going to get this nailed down and 
I’ll show you why in just a second. You’re in the right ballpark. You’re fine.
(pausing)
So X represents one of your concerns. Let’s just say this represents the concern for being related. 
Everybody’s got this concern. A hermit expresses this concern by saying “I’m not related.” 
CONCERN
In introducing the distinction concern, Erhard is articulating 
another hint at the realm of Being the Forum is designed to evoke. 
As with his earlier conversation about moods, he is relocating the 
source of participants’ problems from their own agency to the 
contextualizing background. 
In Being and Time, Heidegger makes a similar move when 
he says that “Being-in-the-world has always dispersed itself or 
even split itself up into definite ways of Being-in.” To develop 
this point, he provides a list of examples, such as having to do 
with something, producing something, attending to something, 
undertaking, and considering. “All these ways of Being-in,” he says 
“have concern as their kind of Being” (BT 83).
Heidegger also distinguishes a category that he calls deficient 
modes of concern, in which “the possibilities of concern are kept 
to a ‘bare minimum’” (BT 83). Deficient modes include leaving 
undone, neglecting, renouncing, and taking a rest.
In everyday use, the word “concern” can have several 
meanings. The most common in our current usage is 
apprehension, as in “I am concerned for the success of our 
project.” But Heidegger and Erhard have used the term in another 
way, as a term for an existential characteristic of human beings, “a 
possible way of Being-in-the-world.” 
Just as human beings are never not in-the-world, they are 
likewise never not concerned, since they are concern essentially. 
Consider: you cannot locate yourself outside of your concerns, 
since the very attempt to do so is itself a manifestation of concern. 
Like lightning, which exists only in flashing, a human being exists 
always and only as a body of concerns.
With this distinction, both Heidegger and Erhard are 
undermining our everyday understanding of the meanings in 
our world. In so doing, they are preparing the way for the final 
transformational leap, the evocation of the Nothing. ■

SPEAKING BEING
You’ve got a concern for being related otherwise why would you be concerned about not being 
related? Clear? 
(pausing)
What is our access to what concerns us? Our access to what concerns us is to get at what con-
cerns us in its aftermath. After the thing happens, in hindsight, we can understand. You can’t 
even see it before it happens, can you? The already always access that human beings have to 
their concerns, the access you inherited, is something like this...
To the right of the X Erhard listed description, defi nition, and explanation.
ERHARD (continuing)
...All of which, will lead to understanding.
(adding “understanding” to the list)
And out of understanding you derive prescriptions, which gives you guidance for how to deal 
with what concerns you: ten steps to... Now, you haven’t articulated all your prescriptions, have 
you? Because a lot of your prescriptions are contained in the way you are. They’re set in you. 
You want to get this! This is one of those things you have to get. This conversation’s got to be 
there for the whole Forum.
(pausing)
So you’ve got, for example, golden rules about relations, such as “keep them happy,” “do some-
thing so they’re attached to you,” et cetera. You and I have got great prescriptions. And what 
you can predict out of that is that you and I will get better and better at that. A rat can learn 
how to negotiate a maze by finding a piece of cheese, but will choose a new tunnel if the cheese 
is moved. The difference between a human being and a rat is as follows: a human being will go 
down the tunnel with no cheese forever. You know, you’ve been doing the same shit year after 
year after year, hoping for a different outcome. What you care about is being in the right tunnel, 
regardless of whether there’s cheese or not. Doing the same thing over and over again expecting 
different results. That’s the definition of insanity.
(turning to the chalkboard and indicating the empty space to the left of the X) 
Nobody looks over here, before it happens. 
(writing the word “source”)
That’s where it’s generated, that’s where it’s created. You want to listen up to this next part. Wake 
up! Wake up! When you get to the source of something you are no longer limited by it. That, by 
the way, is a part of how this works: by getting to the source of things. 
(to Wes and Kipp)
I promise that tomorrow I will give them one answer—the answer to what those guys on moun-
taintops in Tibet are looking for.
(pausing)
We’re going to get at concerns from the source side. You don’t get description, definition, 
explanation, and prescription—you just get power. You don’t get a PhD out of here. Plato and 
Socrates killed that kind of research anyway. They tried it and found out it didn’t work. You read

Lee Iacocca and Al Newheart’s books? They would give everything they’ve got if they could give 
what they’ve got to you. Why can’t they? 
(pointing to the right of the X on the chalkboard)
Because they write the book in this language, the language of description, definition, and expla-
nation. Because people don’t buy books they can’t understand. That’s why we took your money 
before you got in here. When I talk about power I’m talking about something like the freedom 
to be, not force, which is the negation of power. I saw a film of a Japanese Judo master, and 
never once saw that man stop to think. And I watched the film over and over. The guys he was 
fighting stopped to think and got thrown. He was acting out of being something. His opponents, 
on the other hand, were acting out of knowing the answers. You see, you can’t throw somebody 
unless they’re set some way. 
(moving away from the board)
We’re going to talk about another critical thing: the listening that you are. I know you’ve got 
questions and comments, and I know some of it didn’t go clunk for you yet. That’s all right. 
We’ll get there. I talk in a language designed and crafted to give access to what concerns you at 
its source. Now I want to talk about the already always listening that you are. What is the listen-
ing you already always are? For the moment, in this conversation, what you are is a listening. 
In the normal course of events, I talk to you like you’re an empty vessel. That isn’t the way it is. 
The vessel’s already full, up to the top. It only admits certain things and it expels other things. It 
changes certain things. You and I are an already always listening.
(pausing)
When I got this distinction already always listening—not a concept or an idea, but a distinction; 
I’m teasing you with that word and you’ll find out about it tomorrow—I began to look at what is 
my already always listening. It was very clear to me. The already always listening I was, was “I 
know.” I was even a bigger pain in the ass in those days, and a smartass to boot. The only thing I 
ever heard was what I already knew. You wake up a certain listening. Your job on this break will 
be to discover the listening which you already always are.
(pausing)
Who can see already what your listening is? 
PARTICIPANT
The already always listening which I am is that I understand you completely. 
ERHARD
Very good.
PARTICIPANT
I’m not good enough.
ERHARD
A lot of us share that one: “The listening I’m going to provide for you is ‘I’m not good enough.’” 
Already Always Listening
This is a core distinction of The Forum, a hint that works together 
with other distinctions (e.g., mood and concern) to relocate 
participants’ understanding of the source of meaning in their 
lives. It asks participants to consider that the way they hear (and 
see) events and people in their lives is a function of their listening, 
rather than being sourced by the people and events themselves. 
It would be possible, of course, to engage in a similar 
conversation using a more familiar psychological model. Such a 
conversation would assert that one’s perceptions are shaped by 
one’s attitudes. This way of framing things would be immediately 
accessible to anyone whose understanding has been shaped by 
th e Cartesian paradigm of an “internal” subject in an objectively 
meaningful world. 
But locating the source of meaning in one’s listening rather 
than in one’s mind situates the process in the world rather than 
“in the heads” of participants. This furthers the development of 
the Heideggerian model of human being as Being-in-the-world. 
Participants in Werner Erhard’s work are frequently coached 
to “stay out of your head,” and to “get present.” In Erhard’s 
vocabulary, “in your head” is equivalent to “in the past.” This is 
where the nature of one’s already always listening is determined: 
one makes decisions about people based on past events (“he’s 
untrustworthy,” “she’s controlling,” “they never listen to me”), and 
these decisions shape the way life occurs in the future. 
Erhard has used the analogy of yellow sunglasses, worn for an 
extended period of time: eventually, you forget that the sunglasses

I’m going to figure out what you’re saying wrong.
ERHARD
There’s a lot of crap in school. I don’t want to put the school system down. I have a lot of 
respect for teachers. But one of the things you find out in school is that you’re either smart or 
dumb. However, there’s no such thing as dumb. I did some work in a school for the disabled. 
One student, Jesse, was considered “uneducable.” It was decided, however, that he was educa-
ble enough to be sent to a school to learn to wash cars. On the day I was there, I was told that 
Jesse had stuffed a teacher in a trash can. As a consequence, he got sent back to the home for 
disabled students, where he could sit around, be friendly, and play. Stupid is a way to survive in 
school. Stupid is an act, a racket.
PARTICIPANT
The already always listening that I am is “I don’t want to and you can’t make me.”
ERHARD
You want to get this. A lot of people listen through “life is hard.” A lot of people listen through 
“life is a burden.” My dentist told me about his experience as a Boy Scout. No matter what the 
scoutmaster had suggested—hiking, swimming, going home—the Scouts always had the same 
response: “OH NOOOOOO!” You are this listening. That’s the clearing you are in which life 
happens. 
PARTICIPANT
Mine is “How can I use this?” “How can I get better?”
ERHARD
Almost everybody’s like that: “How can I use this?” Almost all the power in the world can’t be 
used. People don’t use power. Power uses people.

Great.

My already always listening is “How can I help you? Do you like me now?”
ERHARD
Beautiful.
are the cause of the world’s yellowness. Like the sunglasses, one’s 
way of listening remains invisible because it is always and already 
determining one’s point of view, making the way a situation 
appears become the way things are. The aim of this inquiry is 
for participants to notice these already always ways of listening 
in as much specificity as possible. The Forum proposes that the 
fundamental elements of human listening are widely shared, even 
across cultures; Erhard asserts that there is a “culture of human 
being” that transcends national boundaries. All human beings, 
for example, listen for positive assessments of themselves, and 
for evidence that they are right in their beliefs about the world. 
But individuals develop specific variations, and in this part of The 
Forum dialogue participants are encouraged to discover their own. 
In this way, the dialogue continues to turn participants toward 
themselves in an intensely reflexive process. ■

My already always listening is “I’m very clever and I’ll prove it to you.”
ERHARD
See, there are times when “I’m very clever and I’ll prove it to you” is a very workable listening. 
But if you’re already always “I’m very clever and I’ll prove it to you,” there are a lot of occasions 
that doesn’t match. 
PARTICIPANT
I have several of these. My listening is that “I’m not good enough.”
ERHARD
“I’m not good enough” almost always has got another listening, which is “I’m better than you 
are.” “I’m not good enough but I’m better than you are.” You want to listen up. These guys are 
being authentic about their own inauthenticity. These are not nice people. They are cold, calcu-
lating, conniving people. They are out to get you to like them. And it’s not them. They didn’t in-
vent that. And if this is the opening that I’m providing for the world to occur in, it’s not surpris-
ing how the world shows up. We have done some work facilitating meetings between American 
and Soviet representatives. We discovered that the already always listening of the Americans is 
“You can’t be trusted for your word; now let’s talk.” This made the results predictable.
PARTICIPANT
My always already listening is “I’m too smart and too quick, and I better not let anyone know 
that.”
ERHARD
It’s the “already always way of listening.” I keep losing why the order is important, but there’s 
some significance to the order. What is the already always listening that gives you being the way 
you are? Believe it or not, the way you are is given to you by your listening. 
PARTICIPANT
“You’re boring.”
ERHARD
We’re going to take a break. I want you to consider that the way you are is given to you by your 
listening. I’m inviting you to get down to the already always listening, you know, as deep as you 
can, however deep that happens to be. Clear?

Erhard’s influence on the language of Western culture has been significant. His 
terminology, like Heidegger’s, has always been unusual and highly purposive, and 
many of these words and phrases made their way into the public sphere, some to 
lasting effect. But that language, in its casual use, began to lose its power. Heidegger 
detailed this process of devolution in Being and Time:
SESSION FOUR INTERVAL
I hardly use the word “transformation” at all any more. . . . because 
while it once was a word that people had to think about, struggle 
to grasp, work on, that’s just not true anymore. The word no longer 
wakes people up. Now, when you say “transformation,” the word 
puts them to sleep—like they know what it means—they stop 
thinking, looking, inquiring. 
Instead, he said, as his ontological inquiry has developed, “the notions keep getting 
said differently” (Simon, “Quarterbacks and Coaches: Tossing It Around with Werner 
Erhard,” Family Therapy Networker, March–April 1986, 30–39).
Heidegger addressed his own confrontation with this situation in his essay “A 
Dialogue on Language,” a transcript of his conversation with a Japanese scholar. At 
one point Heidegger (referred to in the transcript as the Inquirer) mentions two of 
the ideas that were central in his early work, hermeneutics and phenomenology.

SPEAKING BEING
In the language which is spoken when one expresses oneself, there 
lies an average intelligibility; and in accordance with this intelligi-
bility the discourse which is communicated can be understood to a 
considerable extent, even if the hearer does not bring himself into 
such a kind of Being towards what the discourse is about as to have 
a primordial understanding of it. We do not so much understand 
the entities which are talked about; we already are listening only to 
what-is-said-in-the-talk as such. What is said in the talk gets under-
stood; but what the talk is about is understood only approximately 
and superficially. . . . Idle talk is the possibility of understanding 
everything without previously making the thing one’s own. . . . Thus, 
by its very nature, idle talk is a closing-off , since to go back to the 
ground of what is talked about is something which it leaves undone. 
(BT 212–213)
“
Erhard’s comments in a 1986 interview, discussing the evolution of his own 
language use, echo Heidegger’s account of the process by which terms lose their 
originative power. Many of the words he had used in his work, Erhard said, “even-
tually drifted into popular use.” They “lost the creative intention behind them and 
degenerated into a kind of jargon.” Outside their original context, as Heidegger put 
it, the terms no longer reached out into the “totality of involvements” in which their 
significance was grounded (BT 200). 
This was the fate of the term “transformation,” a central term to which Erhard 
had assigned “an extremely precise meaning.” Today, he said, “you hear it every-
where. You read about it in business journals. It’s ‘hot.’ So, to some degree, it’s lost 
its potency.” He continued:
[Japanese]: I am all the more puzzled that you have meanwhile 
dropped both words.
[Inquirer]: That was done, not—as is so oft en thought—in order to 
deny the significance of phenomenology, but in order to abandon 
my own path of thinking to namelessness.
[Japanese]: An eff ort with which you will hardly be successful. . . .
[Inquirer]: . . . since one cannot get by in public without rubrics. 
(“DL” in OWL 29)
“
What is essential in both Heidegger’s work and Erhard’s is what is unspoken and 
therefore essentially nameless. Much of Erhard’s work during the four decades of its 
evolution may be seen as the development of new rubrics (distinctions) to replace 
those that have devolved into jargon, such that what is said makes present what 
cannot be said in words.

SPEAKING BEING
The Forum resumed at 10:30 pm. Erhard began by inviting questions from the
participants. One participant, reviewing The Forum, shared that his already always 
listening had altered as a result of that experience.  
ERHARD (addressing the group)
He’s got a possibility beyond his thrown listening. He got it by owning his 
thrown listening. There’s something called getting off  it. This is a sacred thing.
To get off  it is sacred. Now, what does getting off  it mean? It means he’s not 
constrained to entertain that listening. He can hear himself listening and get 
off  that listening. When his already always listening comes up, he is able to 
own it, to embrace it, to be responsible for it. In the normal course of events,
if I found out my already always listening was disempowering I would try to
stop it. He didn’t change it. That’s the big secret. Because when you change it, 
nothing changes.
(shifting tone)
This is a “you-gotta-get-this.” So listen up. 
At the chalkboard, Erhard placed the chalk on the surface and moved it, so that 
the chalk ended in a diff erent place but a line remained indicating the path of its 
movement.
ERHARD (continuing)
Change persists. When you’re diff erent, what persists? That which you’re dif-
ferent than. So when you’re diff erent you’re the same, because the thing from 
which you’re diff erent is still there. The more diff erence, the more persistence. 
If you’re really diff erent, the thing you’re diff erent than has a big persistence. 
If I’m a nice guy as a solution to a problem, the problem for which being a nice
guy is a solution stays in place. About ninety-nine percent of what you are,
you became as a solution to a problem. Education is a solution to being stupid. 
When you solve a problem, what persists is the problem.
(to the participant)
So your listening that altered hadn’t solved the problem of your already always 
listening.
(to the group)
He had embraced it. He was able to be with the problem.

Can you imagine putting two solid objects in the same place at the same time?

the same space—the space between them—and they will disappear. Anything 
you can let be will let you be. There are no accidents of being. You’ve got to be 
there for it, open for it, available for it.
DAVID
I wanted to recognize that I haven’t really been listening. 
ERHARD
Recognition is the beginning. When you recognize your own already always 
listening, you’re on the fi eld. The game’s not over, but you’re on the fi eld.
DAVID
What do I do with my realization?
ERHARD
Nothing. It’ll do something with you. It’ll give you something you didn’t have 
before. Most of you ought to be able to map what David said onto your own 
listening.
Here Erhard called Kipp to the platform to conduct the next exercise; Erhard 
remained nearby, interrupting occasionally to reinforce a point. 
KIPP (to the group) 
Your job is to sit in your chair, and when I say “now,” describe to yourself 
whatever’s happening right now. 
(pausing)
Now.
(a minute of silence)
Okay, plenty of data. Let’s have a few people report what they are experiencing
now.
PARTICIPANT
I’m bored and I don’t want to be here.

Forum Day One: Session Five
81
PARTICIPANT
I noticed I was really exhausted.
KIPP
So what you just did was unconceal a fundamental condition that human
beings are. I asked you to sit in your chair and think about what’s happening
right now, and what did you do? By the time you get around to describing
what’s happening right now, it’s gone. Yet everybody stood up authentically, 
honestly, and described what happened then but said it was what is now.
There’s no description available for now. So you’ve got to have the representa-
tion. But what’s present is clearly distinct from the representation. And what it
is to be a human being is not to have that distinction. This is what happened at
the party before you got here. The domains of presence and representation got
collapsed. The moment you say what was happening is what is happening, the
representation starts to shape the presence.
ERHARD
What’s the diff erence between now and your representation of now? You 
can never describe presence because there’s no description in the realm of 
presence. If this isn’t making sense, don’t worry. The valuable stuff  in here
will not make sense. But it’s valid. “Make sense” means “fi ts with what you 
already know.” To get what doesn’t make sense requires thinking. What Kipp 
is trying to get you to get is that you don’t make any distinction between love
as a presence and love as a story. Is there anybody in the room who can’t see 
that existence as a presence is diff erent from existence as a concept or repre-
sentation?
(pausing)
Life exists in the world of concepts and life exists in the world of presence. 
But that’s misleading, because the two get collapsed. Something happens,
like a “what happened.” And that devolves into a concept. What happened
back then is never present like a presence. But that’s not clear to you. You
think you’re dealing with what happened when what you’re really dealing
with is your story about what happened. One is not better than the other. 
The problem is when they get mixed together. This creates a vicious circle: 
the concept of your previous experience now becomes a fi lter for your next 
experience, which is now a little less free because it is conceptually shaped. 
The conceptually shaped experience reinforces the concept; the reinforced 
concept more fully shapes the experience. I’m trying to drive out this seven-
ties bullshit that there’s something wrong with your head. I’m an anti-human 
potentialist. I’m not saying that you’re stuck in the concept. I’m saying that 
you’re stuck in the vicious circle. I don’t want questions. I want to know: 
“Did you get that?”
(pausing)
Good. Everybody got that. So now we’re going to demonstrate what happens 
when you’ve got that distinction. Once you get a distinction, it uses you. Three
distinctions to get: one is the realm of existence called presence. The second is 
the realm of existence called concept or representation. The third is the vicious 
circle. The vicious circle is constructed by a collapse of the fi rst two domains.
(pausing)
We’re going to play a new game. We’re going to do a survey. How many of you 
are tired? 
(a majority of participants raised their hands) 
How many of you have a headache? 
(calling on a young woman named Diane)
Would you be willing to participate in a demonstration? Then please come up
here onto the platform.
Diane sat in the second director’s chair that an assistant placed alongside the fi rst.
ERHARD
Would you be willing to have your headache disappear?
DIANE
Yes. 
ERHARD
And would you be willing to not know why it disappeared? 
DIANE
Okay.
ERHARD
Please close your eyes. How long have you had your headache?

About a pint.
ERHARD
On a scale of one to ten, where is it?
DIANE
Six and a half.
ERHARD
Why do you have it?
DIANE
Because it’s been a long day.
ERHARD
Headache and long day live in diff erent realms. You have collapsed them. So,
why do you have a headache?
DIANE
Because I’ve been sitting still.
ERHARD
So you’ve got two domains collapsed. Every time I ask you that stupid question 
“Why?” it collapses the two domains.
(repeating this series of questions several times)
How’s your headache now?
DIANE
It’s a four.
ERHARD
How much water would it hold? 
DIANE
Still a pint.
ERHARD
It’s critically important that you get it. The headache now and the headache
a moment ago are collapsed together. When she says the headache is “still” a 
pint, I know she has collapsed the headache now with the representation of 
the headache then.
(continuing to question her regarding the headache’s shape, color and location 
right now)
Do you have a headache?
DIANE
No, I don’t.
ERHARD (to the group)
What happened was, I asked her questions which in order to answer she had
to be in the presence of her headache like a presence.
DIANE
I focused on it.
ERHARD
No! What happened was you got the domains uncollapsed. All that happened
was that the headache, instead of showing up in the vicious circle, showed up
distinct in the domain of presence. You looked at your headache. You were
present to the headache. There are no reasons when the headache is like a
presence.
A second demonstration followed with Patricia, a participant who said she was 
tired. She sat in one of the director’s chairs; Erhard sat on the arm of his, facing 
her. 
ERHARD

I’m going to give you an assignment which will determine how much you get

you have a chance to enhance what you get out of here. Bring your life in here
tomorrow. Don’t bring the face you brought today—the “I’ve got it all togeth-

What has it cost you in life to collapse those domains? What you’re bringing in 
tomorrow is your inauthenticity. 
(pausing)
We didn’t talk about looking good today, did we? We’re going to do it in 
thirty seconds. You have a major concern for looking good. For some people
looking bad is looking good. So when you come in tomorrow, be able to
talk about where in your life are you used by looking good. Looking good
owns your life.

The four-day format of this Forum is both an asset and a liability. The 
liability is that there aren’t five days between the weekends for you to be 
back in your lives and talk about your experience. You have got to commu-
nicate what’s happening for you here. You have got to be articulate in this
conversation. Tonight you’ve got to talk about this to other people. You’ve
got to begin to be able to generate the conversation. You’ve got to be able to 
speak this. You don’t have to explain it. You want to be in communication
about this like an experience, like a presence. I know a lot of people who
understand this and don’t live it.
PARTICIPANT
It is very late and I am tired.
PATRICIA
A four. 
ERHARD
Do you know why you are tired? Notice I didn’t ask you “do you think you
k
know why?” I asked if you know why you’re tired.
PATRICIA
No. 
ERHARD
What’s the relationship between the reasons you have for being tired and 
being tired? There isn’t any. The reasons are valid. In other words, in the world
of reasons every reason you have is a valid reason. You don’t have any nutty 
reasons.
(turning to the group and speaking in a loud voice)
There’s no such thing as tired! That’s a concept!
(back to Patricia)
Where in your body are you experiencing what you used to call being tired? 
PATRICIA
My arms.
ERHARD
And where else in your body?
As Erhard repeated the question, she responded each time by identifying a tired 
area of her body.
ERHARD
Nothing much conceptual about this, is there? It’s all presence.
PATRICIA
My arms are still tired.
ERHARD
For a while there you were really looking. But then you got to thinking 
about it. Whenever you say “still” or “also”... See how easy it is to collapse 
the domains?

SPEAKING BEING
the circumstances. There are also moments when we experience freedom from
self-awareness. The diff erence between these two states is relevant to our inquiry 
here. Where does the self live when it is not alive in our awareness?
This leads to the second point made here by Heidegger, one which is generally less 
apparent than the first: self-reflection is at the same time self-production: “The essential 
thing is ‘I will myself’” (EP 64). The human self is not like the human elbow: it is not a 
P
ready-made part of the package that accompanies an infant’s arrival in the world. What 
is included in the package, although not immediately functional, is language, which pro-
vides the material with which we are eventually able to produce a self. But in a world of 
beings with selves, questions about the nature and stability of the self arise persistently,
and recent advances in the study of the human brain, as well as child development, have
informed the inquiry but have not answered the questions. Therefore we note the point 
here as a question to be kept open as The Forum proceeds.
Regarding the phenomenon of reflexion, Heidegger says further that it is “Man’s
settling down in one of his essential places,” and he notes with emphasis that it is 
characterized by “certainty, certainty” (EP 60). That is, for the most part, human
P
beings are made both secure and comfortable by the condition that their self-knowl-
edge provides. While many of us spend considerable time tinkering with the details
of our identities in the interest of self-improvement, on the whole those identities
give us security. On the whole, we are at home in ourselves.
This, at least, is the way of things in the current paradigm. This interpretation 
of the self, however, while self-evident to most of us, is an artifact of a particular way 
t
of understanding human being. Indeed, it has been the dominant understanding for 
several centuries; and while it is increasingly questioned among people who think 
actively about these matters, such as philosophers and other scholars, it remains
the operative understanding for most people in the world—not as something they
bring to mind, or could articulate, but as a way of functioning in their everyday lives.
This particular way of understanding the world, and our place in it, is generally 
known as the Cartesian paradigm. It is so called in recognition of the man in whose 
thinking the model was crystallized, the seventeenth-century French philosopher 
and mathematician Rene Descartes. As a philosopher, Descartes’ job was to engage
in thought experiments; and in one of those experiments—which turned out to be 
significant for all of us—he decided that he would place everything in the world in 
doubt. His purpose in doing this was to discover what, if anything, was indubitable:
what in the world, in the face of committed skepticism, could retain a quality of 
absolute certainty?
END OF DAY ONE INTERVAL
Reflexion: The Cartesian Deficiency
At the outset of Being and Time, Martin Heidegger makes a point that might other-
wise be dismissed as obvious: any inquiry into the nature of Being—such as Werner 
Erhard’s project, or Heidegger’s own—must always be conducted by human beings,
who as far as we can tell are the only beings who have a concern for the matter, as
well as the only ones who are capable of inquiring. Humans are therefore involved
at multiple points in the inquiry—as the beings who are questioning, as the beings of 
whom the question is asked, and as the beings about whom the question is asked.
t
This point is important because of its implications for the inquiry: it will be char-
acterized throughout by reflexion. Reflexion, or self-referentiality, is an important 
idea in the work of both Heidegger and Erhard. The term designates a state in which 
we are turned toward our selves, as when confronting a reflection.
d
Reflexion requires, first of all, self-consciousness. To say that human beings are 
the only beings for whom their being is an issue, is to say that human beings are the 
only beings who are self-conscious—or, to say it more simply, we are the only beings
who have a self. While the consciousness of other animals is likely always to remain
a mystery at some level, it is generally agreed that dogs do not reflect upon their 
 existence. Here, Heidegger emphasizes the centrality of such reflection to human 
awareness:
Consciousness is self-consciousness, and self-consciousness 
is ego-consciousness or “we”-consciousness. The essential
thing in this is the re-flexive, and in it the “I,” “we,” “self,” 
the presentation-to-self and self-production. (EP 64)
P
“
Two points in this passage should be noted. The first, like many points that
arise in an ontological inquiry, can seem at first both apparent and trivial: one’s
consciousness always includes consciousness of one’s self. That is, in being aware
of my world, I am always at some level aware of my self as the center of my aware-
ness. It is worth taking a moment to notice this, because the nature of the self, and
the quality of its presence in human awareness, will become a central topic as The
Forum proceeds. Clearly, there are moments in life when one’s self-consciousness
becomes intensified, resulting in either pleasure or discomfort, depending upon

Forum Day One: End of Day One Interval 87
The outcome of this experiment led him to the formulation that has come
down to us as his most famous statement, one familiar to almost every university 
undergraduate although generally without a clear idea of its implications: I think,
therefore I am (or in Descartes’ original Latin, Cogito, ergo sum).
That is: if I doubt everything, the only thing of which I can be certain is that I
am the doubter. I can know nothing with certainty except myself, as the one who
is thinking. Further, since I am the only certainty, I am also the inevitable arbiter of 
what counts as real. In the Cartesian model of human being that emerged from this 
experiment—the model that today we inhabit unthinkingly—the cogito, the “I,” the 
being who thinks, is the grounding certainty at the center of things. It is the subject 
(Latin subjectum, what lies beneath), while out there, independent of the subject, is a 
world of objects (objectum, over against). For humans, Being-in-the-world demands
that we determine the true meanings of those objects. Heidegger scholar Michael E.
Zimmerman describes the situation this way:
Although Copernicus had only recently shattered man’s
illusions about being the center of the physical universe,
Descartes established man as the ontological center:
l
henceforth, the reality of the real was what man asserted it
to be. . . . “To be” meant to be conceived by and through the
subject. . . . Everything got determined and evaluated from
the standpoint of man. (“Beyond ‘Humanism’: Heidegger’s
Understanding of Technology” 222)
It is this paradigm, of the fixed and self-certain human subject, that both Heide-
gger and Erhard are placing in question through their work. As Heidegger points out,
Descartes arrived at his conclusion by accepting as given the nature of the sum—
Being, the “I am.” But Heidegger proposes that the nature of “I am” has never been 
fully worked out in the history of Western philosophy, so that behind Descartes’ con-
clusion “there lies hidden a failure to master the basic problem of Being” (BT 127). 
T
The Cartesian model itself was the result of an experiment in reflexive thinking.
The heart of the subject–object distinction is “I think something” (EP 62) a premise
P
that turns thinking back upon itself, toward the “I,” and thus toward “the presenta-
tion-to-self and self-production” (EP 64). Presentation demands production, since 
the “I” is not there to be reflected upon. In reflecting upon my self, I create my self.
“
But in the Cartesian model, the subject is self-certain—that is, certain of itself 
as an entity that persists. The clearing for creation has been occupied. Therefore
Heidegger proposes that self-consciousness, which has in Descartes’ model bent
back far enough to see its “I,” must now bend back further and confront the context
in which the “I” stands essentially, a context that puts its self’s certainty in question.
As we will show, the culminating event of The Forum—the unconcealment of 
 Being—is accomplished through the evocation of a profound bending-back, reveal-
ing not only the context of the “I,” but in a masterful moment of existential rug-pull-
ing, the context of that context as well.

Forum Day Two: Session One

The day began at 9:00 am, with Julie, The Forum Supervisor, leading the participants through the
process of fi lling out the Graduate Records form. Before the forms were collected, she asked the 
participants to stop writing, and Kipp mounted the platform (T-shaped, with stairs at the end of the 
center runway) and led a conversation about the Six-Day Course.* Following this hour-long conversa-
tion, Wes replaced Kipp on the platform to invite participants to share what they encountered when 
doing the assignment given at the end of Day One.
WES
Good morning. We’re going to begin with sharing. Would someone repeat the three assignments 
Werner gave you last night?
MAC (a participant in a wheelchair)
You’re one of the leaders of this Forum. This program has been going on for seventeen years
with hundreds of thousands of people, which means you have had many hundreds of Forums.
To keep us here to one o’clock means for me that after doing my homework I wasn’t able to 
get to bed until a quarter till three. I request that you organize yourselves, as we must organize
ourselves, so that we can leave here by eleven instead of one o’clock.
WES
I got your suggestion.
MAC
But are you going to do anything about it?

FORUM DAY TWO: 
SESSION ONE
* 
NOTE: The Six-Day Course originally was included as part of what was called the Ten-Day
Teen Training, first delivered in June 1973. In addition to the four-day est Training, six days 
were devoted to various physical challenges such as riding zip-lines and repelling cliff s. 
The Six-Day Course that Kipp discussed here at the beginning of Day Two of The Forum was
first delivered in March 1977 for adult graduates of the est Training, and continued to be de-
livered through the transition to The Forum in 1985, up until June 1991 when the last Six-Day
was held.
Some elements of the course were included (though significantly revised) in what became
the Landmark Advanced Course, first delivered in 1991. This course still (as of 2019) serves as the 
second of four parts of Landmark’s Curriculum for Living, the other two parts of which are 
The Landmark Forum in Action ten-session seminar series and The Landmark Self-Expression 
and Leadership Program.

And look at areas of your life where looking good uses you.
WES
Look at the possibility that looking good has used your life. Which one do you want to share 
about?
SIENNA
I want to share about looking good, and the way I look good goes back to the already always
listening. I have a presence that is an act about knowing, about knowing it all.
WES
Without this distinction you are dealing with, we tend to put our knowledge and our informa-
tion in a box, and we don’t see that we use that box for something, we make the box itself right,
NOTE: See the beginning of Session Three of Day Four,
where Mac comes forward to share what he had gotten out
of the course.

and we don’t see how we use the box to be right, which makes us very ineff ective, by the way.
Whatever power knowing has, whatever power information has, the power becomes displaced 
by the motivation behind the gathering of it.
SIENNA
What I do then is spend a lot of time judging whether they are acting as if they know, or acting
as if I know, even when I don’t know, which makes it very upsetting for me yesterday and this 
morning, that there’s a piece of me that knows that what’s critical for me, you know Werner 
said to focus on where you were upset or confused. And I’m attracted to that area in the circle
that I don’t know that I don’t know. And when I’m in my act of having to know, it is so critical 
to my success that I’m willing to say that I know when I don’t. And then I miss the opportunity 
to create solutions when I’m in my act “I already know.”
WES
Brilliant. She’s creating “creativity,” and she knows she can’t step into that domain, because the
very thing that keeps her from stepping into that domain is this thing, that she’s “got to know.”
t
But if you’re going to create something, you can’t know what you’re going to create. That’s
the area of creativity: you can’t step into it unless you’re willing to give up what you previ-
ously knew. This is a major issue people have a breakthrough with in the creativity seminar.
(to Sienna)
That’s great.
SIENNA
There’s another thing about the act and inauthenticity, which I have become very sophisticated 
in. I decided at some point about people who are assholes, who stand up and challenge author-
ity, and I decided all that stuff  was inappropriate. And yet one of my inauthenticities is that I
walk around knowing that I know a lot more than anyone else. But if I said that, that would
mean being an asshole: and so I’ve cloaked it. But it’s worse because it’s indirect. And then I
walk around worried that people will fi nd out what I don’t want them to fi nd out about me. It’s
silly because it’s probably written all over me.
WES
They won’t acknowledge it because the unspoken agreement with your friends is that you won’t 
call them on their inauthenticity and they won’t call you on yours. That’s what it means to have
a friend. You’ll let that slip by. The other agreement is that your friends are willing to listen to 
your racket. Today you’ll fi nd out about your racket.
(to the group)
She is sharing an aspect of her racket. It’s a technical term. I don’t know if we mentioned it 
yesterday, but here’s how to listen to people sharing in here. You should listen to the partici-
pants’ shares like that’s you in some way speaking. Even if the person sharing is female and
you’re male. The Forum is not about men and women as men and women as much as it is

about human beings. And I’m inviting you, like a possibility, to see your humanness in anybody 
speaking, and let something open up for you. So who can see an aspect of themselves in what
she just shared?
(many people raising their hands)
SIENNA
I’m also, when I’m in this place of knowing and acting that way, and not being willing to say I
know more than you do, that I’m very insulated about sharing with people, like yesterday, like I 
didn’t want to talk. And I felt very separated from everyone. I didn’t want to see as far as seeing
that my already listenings were similar to other people’s in the room, but I didn’t want to see that it
wasn’t even them and me. I always felt like those things were always kind of special, like the cho-
sen few and not just being human, like everybody. And that separates me, in a way that means that
I don’t share when I’m confused, and people don’t really know what’s going on with me. It’s like 
I’m missing all that. I’m both missing something about being related to people, and I also see how 
I’m stuck there, and that it is important, unless I want to stay here being stuck. I can’t have both.
WES
Thanks. Very useful. Look around the room. You should notice that in a Forum of about 500 
people, there are probably around 20 or 25 hands up. Hands down. Here’s something you want
to get off  of real quick. It’s called participating in The Forum. It’s called sharing in The Forum. 
The fi rst thing you should know is The Forum isn’t real. This is not real life. Now, we’re going to 
sit here for four days, kind of in this artifi cial environment. What’s the point? The point is what 
goes on after in your life. This is coaching for your life. But you’ve got to begin it here. And the
way you begin it here is to start participating, start sharing. It’s okay if you kind of mess it up a
little in here, you see, this isn’t real. But there’s something at stake in here. You have to confront 
what’s at stake for you in here. She just shared something that few people ever see about them-
selves, that their life is about knowing something so as to look good. And the few people who
get that ever, get that it’s killing their life. So here’s a woman who shared something that’s going
to open up her life. That’s what’s happening in The Forum. Are you willing to participate? Okay, 
who’s willing to participate?
(calling on fi ve people who stand)
PHOEBE
I was sure that with all these people putting their hands up I wouldn’t get picked. But I got picked.
WES
Yes. 
PHOEBE
It was safe to do what everyone else was doing. Also, part of my act for looking good is to be
very appropriate.
Being-in-the-World: Being-With
Werner Erhard emerged into public attention during a period char-
acterized by some as a decade of Narcissism, a period when the cul-
ture’s emphasis on self-understanding and personal empowerment 
led to the emergence of what has been called the “Me” generation.
As a result, Erhard’s work was sometimes tarred with that brush. 
For the authors of this book, however, a significant element 
of The Forum experience has been the atmosphere of aff inity and
connection with others that inevitably emerges among partic-
ipants as the course moves toward its conclusion. Certainly, 
individual empowerment is a significant element of the transfor-
mation that The Forum makes available. But this empowerment is
consistently accompanied by an experience of profound related-
ness to others, which then encourages a commitment to commu-
nity contribution. To use a metaphor oft en employed by Erhard, 
the individual empowerment and the sense of connection are as
symbiotic in their emergence as the front and back of a hand.
In Being and Time, Martin Heidegger locates the source of that
connection in the nature of Dasein’s Being-in-the-world.
As noted previously, Dasein, as the clearing for Being-in-
the-world, frees other beings to be the beings they are (see the
sidebar “Being-in-the-World: Being-in” in Session One of Day One,

(referring to Sienna)
What she said, I felt I could identify with and so I felt that I had nothing to contribute. But for
me to really get something out of being here, I really need to say it out loud. I seem to have the 
answer for myself and everyone, and I’m so busy looking good that I’m not getting my..., that
having all the answers has killed off  the possibility in my life.
WES
Like maybe you’ve killed your life.
PHOEBE
Yeah, that I’m so smart and that I’ve got it so fi gured out, that I have the answer and no possi-
bility. And I noticed when we did our homework, last night and this morning, that all that kept
coming up was lots of answers and no new stuff , which is what I think I got out of yesterday,
the possibilities of what my life could be about. That’s what I don’t have is possibility in my life.
WES
Got it. Great. Thanks.
(another participant stands)
ROSS
I’ve been waiting for the right time to get up here and say something profound and so this is the
right time, but it isn’t anything profound.
WES
The wrong time is when it is profound, so you don’t have to worry about it. How many are wait-
ing for something signifi cant, profound, before you’re going to get up to share?
(many raising their hands)
We don’t want your crummy shares! If you really listen you’ll fi nd that the most powerful shares 
are some of the simplest and dealing with the most ordinary aspects of our life. From the power
and insight of The Forum to shed light on the ordinary aspects of our life, you’ll fi nd some of 
the most powerful things you’ve listened to. Thanks for acknowledging that.
ROSS
What happened for me yesterday and last night and I’m convinced, also while I was sleeping,
was just the continuous looking again at all the beliefs, a lot of the things that I’ve been work-
ing on in this area, and opening up diff erent possibilities for it, and starting really, one of the 
reasons why I came to The Forum was that I wanted to take a look at what the barriers were for
my success. I’ve been successful in the past, I’ve been able to create the things that I’ve wanted,
and then they slipped away, for whatever reason, and I really want to take a look at what those
barriers were and what’s been happening. All yesterday and last night, and this morning is, let’s 
take a look at the distinctions. They’re really starting to separate. I fi nd that I spend a lot of time
and energy in the story, and very little time dealing with what’s happening.
as well as the Interval “Dasein: Meaning and Mineness” at the end
of Session Two, Day One). A dog can be a dog only for a human
being; only for a human can a sunset be beautiful. But also among
the entities freed by Dasein to be in the world are other human
beings—entities which are “like the very Dasein which frees them,
in that they are there too, and there with it” (BT 154). 
T
These terms—with and too—are to be understood existential-
ly. That is, Being-there-too does not mean merely that the Others
are present-at-hand in the world, available to be encountered. 
Heidegger is not describing a situation in which beings are located 
alongside each other in world space; rather he is distinguishing
integral elements of the beings themselves. Withness is a part of 
Dasein’s Being—my own Dasein, and the Dasein of Others. The 
“too,” says Heidegger, means a “sameness of Being” (BT 154).
T
Heidegger makes precise use of hyphenation in languaging 
the ontological world-structure he is proposing. Early on in Being
and Time, he specifies that Things—substances, equipment,
objects of nature—are within the world, a location-relationship 
that he indicates by the absence of hyphenation (BT 91). Here, he
T
posits a further specification:
“
  Thus Dasein’s world frees entities which are 
not only quite distinct from equipment and 
Things, but which also—in accordance with
their kind of being as Dasein themselves—are
‘in’ the world in which they are at the same 
time encountered within-the-world, and are 
‘in’ it by way of Being-in-the-world. . . . So if 
one would want to identify the world in gen-
eral with entities within-the-world, one would 
have to say that Dasein too is ‘world.’ (BT 154)
T
So because Dasein—mine and the Others’—are in-the-world exis-
tentially, we can be encountered “in” the world environmentally. 
Once again, we call attention to the deeply reflexive nature
of Heidegger’s ontological distinctions. His languaging repeatedly
turns thinking back upon itself, since his goal is to have us bend
back to see ourselves from a new perspective.

WES
Yeah.
ROSS
And in the short time that I’ve been doing this, I’ve already noticed some openness come into 
the picture.
WES
Yeah, what if you lived your life totally in a story? Just consider that as a possibility. Now I 
know you can always fi nd exceptions, but you know the exception only shows the rule. So don’t
look at the exceptions. Stand in the possibility that your whole life is a story. And as you get
the distinction “story versus what happened,” you might notice that life is passing by, and that
you’re in a story about life. You’re not in life.
ROSS
There were lots of things that I took a look at last night and the major thing that I’d like to share 
with you is integrity... is probably one of my major inauthenticities, at least there’s a possibility 
for that. And I’m real quick to pick it up in somebody else. Actually as a result of yesterday I’ve
been able to look at some of the possibilities where I am not in integrity. I did an exercise with 
my daytimer, and I realized that all the things that are really important to me just didn’t get 
done. And so there’s one major commitment not kept, which I really felt to be important to me 
having accomplished.
WES
Great. Thank you.
MARSHA
Last night when I went home, I guess things were starting to get uncovered because I was so
angry. My normal thing is to be the cheerleader and get up in the morning and get things done
and extend myself so far wide that there’s nothing left for me. It is starting to wear on me physi-
cally, and what I got last night was that I am so angry, so angry: at me. It came across at fi rst last 
night, being so angry at Werner. I did the training 15 years ago, but if I saw Werner out in the 
parking lot last night I would have run him over. I was so angry. I chewed off  my sister-in-law’s 
head last night. It has never been expressed like this before, because it has been so important
to me to express, to get across, “you don’t like me and I’m going to make you like me,” and that 
has taken a tremendous amount of energy, and what is underneath that is just a lot of anger.
WES
And anything underneath that?
MARSHA
I don’t know yet. I’m just really into the anger now.
In Heidegger’s account of Being-with, we find “world” per-
vaded by relatedness. The presence of Others is embedded in all
of our everyday activities. When we are at work on a project, the 
Others for whom the project is being performed are encountered 
in the work. If we walk along the edge of a field, the field “shows
itself as belonging to such and such a person.” If I am at leisure,
the book I am reading “was bought at So-and-so’s shop and given 
by such-and-such a person, and so forth” (BT 154).
T
Heidegger is not making the obvious point that the book 
belongs to someone, but is emphasizing the degree to which the
presence of my relatedness to Others imbues my existence. Others 
whom I encounter in these objects and activities are a part of my 
world and in the same way I am a part of theirs. 
“
 By reason of this with-like Being-in-the-world, 
the world is always the one that I share with 
Others. The world of Dasein is a with-world. 
Being-in is Being-with Others. Their Being-
in-themselves within-the-world is Dasein-with. 
(BT 155)
clearing for me. Others make it possible for me to Be, a situation
that persists even when no Other is present.
“
  Even Dasein’s Being-alone is Being-with in the
world. The Other can be missing only in and for
a Being-with. Being-alone is a deficient mode of 
Being-with; its very possibility is the proof of 
this. (BT 156–157)
T
Thus Heidegger has distinguished in withness an extraordi-
nary existential possibility for human relatedness, a possibility 
which we see as an essential element of The Forum transforma-
tion. Here he specifies another aspect of this connection:
“
 Being-with is such that the disclosedness of 
the Dasein-with of Others belongs to it; this 
means that because Dasein’s Being is Being-
with, its understanding of Being already

Forum Day Two: Session One 
95
WES
You’re present to your anger.
MARSHA
I’m very present to my anger. And I am not a nice person. I’m really getting that I’m, a couple peo-
ple looked around here and “oh boy, what a bitch she is.” And I’m saying, I am the biggest fl aming
bitch. And I’ve covered that up for a long time.
WES (to the group)
Consider the possibility that you are a “covering-up.” I did not say you have a covering-up. I said
consider the possibility that you are a covering-up. See, when she deals with herself, deals with
the covering up; cheerleader on top of angry woman, but that’s who she is.
At this point (10:30 am) Erhard appeared at the back of the room, and spoke in response to the
conversation about covering up. His attire remained the same throughout The Forum: today the 
sweater-vest was olive-green, the slacks brown.
ERHARD
The way it works operationally is—it’s something you’re afraid you might be—is angry. There’s
always a something happened—always, always. However it is that you are, there’s always a 
“something happened” that caused that. And almost nobody knows that because they come at
the way they are from the conceptual side, from the descriptive side, from the explanatory side.
When you get to the source of the way you are, there’s always a “something happened.” You put 
yourself together, fashioned yourself as you were growing up. We pay attention, particular atten-
tion to various aspects of what we call our selves, or what we might call, more accurately, your
identity at various eras of our growing up. In a certain era of your growing up, you were building 
a certain part of your identity. And at another era you built another part of your identity. And
then sometimes you go back and put the fi nishing touches on something you built earlier. But I
want you to begin to be able to think that people are manufactured. You and I are constructed.
Whatever it is that you’re referring to when you say “I think,” whatever the “I” refers to, you call 
that your self, or your identity—sometimes you’ll call it your personality. But whatever is being 
referred to when you say “I think,” “I feel,” “I believe”; and it gets put together out of “what hap-
peneds”; and there’s a “what happened” for every piece of you. A lot of who you are, of how you 
got to be the way you are, and a lot of what maintains your identity is a product of what you’re 
afraid you might be. Something happened in Marsha’s life, and she decided it was wrong to be
angry, or she shouldn’t be angry, or only bad people are angry, or something like that.
(Marsha is weeping; Erhard addresses another participant)
Don’t help her. Thanks.
(continuing)
And she decided that was wrong or bad or something she shouldn’t be, and then she got to be 
afraid that she might be that, and so she had to keep that down in the swamp, at the bottom of 
the Valley of the Shadow of Death, and it’s been there for years, and it runs her life: what she’s
afraid she might be. See I don’t even know that she is angry. I don’t know that the truth about
implies the understanding of Others. This un-
derstanding, like any understanding, is not an 
acquaintance derived from knowledge about 
them, but a primordially existential kind of 
Being, which, more than anything else, makes
such knowledge and acquaintance possible.
(BT 160–161)
Of course, says Heidegger, the factical development of my 
relatedness with another human being will always depend upon 
how well I have come to know myself. And here he makes a point
that is significant for our understanding of The Forum dynamic: 
self-knowledge, he says, arises from relatedness to Others:
“
 Of course it is indisputable that a lively mutual
acquaintanceship on the basis of Being-with, 
oft en depends upon how far one’s own Dasein 
has understood itself at the time; but this
means that it depends only upon how far one’s 
essential Being with Others has made itself 
transparent and has not disguised itself. And 
that is possible only if Dasein, as Being-in-the-
world, already is with Others. (BT 162)
We propose that the transformation that occurs for participants 
in The Forum is not an individual experience, but that the
self-knowledge it makes available arises mutually with an under-
standing of others.
This is the function of The Forum’s dialogic structure, in which
even participants who do not participate overtly in the conversa-
tion are able to find themselves in the sharing of others. Forum par-
ticipants are repeatedly exhorted to listen to others’ sharing “like
that’s you in some way speaking.” As the sharing continues, The 
Forum leader persistently deconstructs each participant’s story 
about his or her experience, and frames the experience instead in 
the language of the distinctions being developed. The distinctions
gradually reveal the ontological structures underlying the expe-
riences, structures common to all of the experiences despite the
diff erences in their details.

SPEAKING BEING
Marsha is that she’s an angry person. I know that’s what’s running her life. Once she’s able to be
with being angry, once she’s able to give being to being angry, she might fi nd out she’s not angry 
g
at all. But “not being angry” is going to run her life until she’s able to be angry. I know you don’t 
get all that yet. You’re starting to get it. As you go along today you will get it. Before you get out 
of here, you will get at the source of your identity. What happens if you get at the source of your 
identity, somebody with a yellow name tag?
Participant (who is wearing a yellow name tag, i.e. someone doing The Forum for the fi rst time)
It doesn’t own you anymore.
ERHARD
Yeah. It’s that simple. This is something almost nobody knows. You’re now one of the few people in 
the world that knows this. What everybody else in the world knows is that you’ve got to fi x what’s
wrong with you, you’ve got to avoid what’s bad, in you or in life. What you now know is any time
you get at the source of something, you are no longer limited to it. Most people would be afraid to do 
what Marsha has done. They fi nd anger so abhorrent, that they are afraid they might fi nd out that 
they are angry. And they can’t tolerate that, they can’t be with that, and so they never get to the being
angry like that’s a possible way of being; they fi ght against being angry, they reject it. In the 70s you 
were supposed to let it all hang out. That’s indulging anger, that doesn’t work either. When you felt
angry you were supposed to spray it all over the place on people. That’s indulging the anger. That’s as
much bullshit as suppressing the anger. There’s a thing called responsibility. As I told you yesterday 
you don’t know what that means yet, but we’ll get to it before we’re done here. Something close to 
owning something, being able to be with it. So you want to take a look down in the swamp down
there at what you’re afraid you might be or hoped you weren’t, or don’t want to be. That’s where the 
monsters are. The green slimy monsters of what you’re afraid to be are running your life. Most of us
would be afraid to get at it, because we’re afraid we might be
t
it. When you own that, at its source, it
e
no longer owns you. We’re afraid to get at it for fear that we might be it. What you’re afraid of owns
you. Marsha, what did you notice in there?
MARSHA
I notice that I’m angry at everybody and everything in this world.
Erhard (to the group)
You want to get the courage in that. She’s angry waiting to happen: already always angry. It’s all 
over the place. It colors the clearing in which the world occurs for her. And only to the degree
she is willing to be with that, standing in front of 800 people and starting to communicate it,
you’re starting to be with it. That’s a lot diff erent than hoping you’re not that. You were saying?
MARSHA
There isn’t one person in this world that I’m not angry with.
ERHARD
And that’s sad for you.
Through this process, as people in the room hear their own 
concerns repeatedly expressed in the speaking of others, not only
do they gain a new way of understanding their own situation, but 
at the same time, through the mutuality implicit in the Forum’s
dialogic structure, the withness of Being-with-Others is gradually 
brought to presence. The dialogue of The Forum thus unconceals
the possibility of a profound relationship of Being among human
beings. This relatedness, we propose, is at a deeper and more fun-
damental level than the diff erences—of race, ethnicity, religion, or 
politics—that occur for us as persistent barriers to cooperation in
all aspects of our lives. Erhard’s work, and its expanding manifes-
tation in the current programs of Landmark Worldwide, create the 
possibility for transcending those barriers. ■
ERHARD (continuing)
“
 So you want to take a look down in the swamp

MARSHA
Yeah, because I want relationships with people, and I can’t get close.
ERHARD
Listen up here, because most of you are not going to have the courage for this. So you need
to get it from those who do have the courage. That there’s something sad for her about being
angry—that’s why she’s afraid she might be angry, then it’s all mashed in with being close. 
Convoluted in a knot.
MARSHA
My whole life has been an act about being happy and cheerful, giving and caring, getting every-
body to like me, and they do. The truth is that I don’t have an enemy in the world.
ERHARD
Hold on for a second. So if you’re a person who has the skills that Marsha has, the skills of be-
ing related to people well, and somehow that’s not nurturing her deeply and profoundly; that’s
not leaving her full of joy, because it’s there in order for her not to be angry! Do you hear the
in-order-to? In order not to be angry?
Marsha remained standing while Erhard worked with several other participants.
ERHARD
So if I’m nice in order not to be angry, what persists? You’ve got to get clear on this. Who’s not
clear on this?
A participant named Mike stood.
ERHARD
So Mike, if I relate well, in order not to be angry, when I relate well, what’s always there is being 
angry. It’s being there as something I’m resisting.
Erhard approached another participant, and did a demonstration in which each man grasped the
other’s hands and attempted to push the other away.
ERHARD
So if I’m resisting something, I’m attached to what I’m resisting. All this relating-well dances 
around anger, is attached to anger. I never have any profound sense of being related, because
what persists under being related is being angry all the time. I don’t have a deep sense of fulfi ll-
ment out of relating well, because what persists is being angry all the time. See, I’m not related 
well in order to be related, I’m related well in order not to be angry. You ever notice that real 
nice people, when you crack their shell a little bit, there’s a lot of dissatisfaction and sadness?
You know, there’s a lot of real nice people in here; all you got to do is crack the surface and then
there’s dissatisfaction. Is it starting to be clear?

MIKE
Just a bit. I see you pushing against this gentleman over here, and I’m understanding something
about anger. You’re saying, pushing it away, it’s still there. Kind of fuzzy.

When I push him away, am I not attached to him? 
MIKE
You’re touching him yes.

No, attached to him. I can’t get away from him as I’m pushing him away, can I?

No you can’t.
ERHARD
So in a sense I’m attached to him, am I not?

And you’re doing the attaching.

Never mind who is doing the attaching.
Erhard returned to the other participant and had him hold Erhard’s shoulders.

So, he’s got me now, right? And I can’t get away. He’s holding on to me, right?

Right.
ERHARD
What’s the diff erence between that and this?
Erhard pushed the participant as he did in the previous instance.
ERHARD
In terms of being attached? Whether John is holding on to me, or I’m pushing him away, we are
r
equally attached.

Okay.

ERHARD
So, whatever it is you’re resisting, it’s exactly the same in its end result as what it is you’re
indulging. If I’m addicted to anger, I’m no more or less attached to anger than if I was resisting 
anger. Clear about that part?
MIKE
I am clear about that part.
ERHARD
Good. Let’s go to the next part. By virtue of not being angry... You see, what being eff ective at re-
lating is about for Marsha, it’s about not being angry. So what’s the result of relating eff ectively?
MIKE
I’m lost.
ERHARD
You’re not lost. You’re intelligent. You’re clear that you don’t understand what I’m saying. Say-
ing you understand when you don’t is “lost.” Clear?
t
MIKE
I want to say yes, but... go ahead.
ERHARD
Is it clear that you aren’t lost?
MIKE
It’s clear that I don’t know what you are talking about right now.
ERHARD
Yeah. That’s pretty clear isn’t it? So you’re not lost. You’re clear.
MIKE
I got that.
ERHARD
Good. Now we’re going back to this business about “if I relate well in order to avoid anger,”
what is the result of my relating well?
MIKE
I’m avoiding the anger.
ERHARD
Perfect. Is there any satisfaction in that? Is that going to leave you whole?

SPEAKING BEING
MIKE
It’ll delay confronting the anger.
ERHARD
It might do that but that’s not my point. My point is that being well related with somebody 
ought to be a source of fulfi llment and satisfaction, yes? 
MIKE
That’s a presupposition.
ERHARD
Yeah: A fairly safe one. If you and I are well related, there ought to be a sense of being fulfi lled 
by that.
MIKE
Okay.
ERHARD
But if you and I are well related in order to avoid being angry, the result of being well related
is not satisfaction and fulfi llment: it is avoiding being angry. So you can be well related all over
the place and it’s not going to leave you full of joy or profoundly satisfi ed. It’s going to leave you
having avoided anger. You won and they gave you the booby prize. Is that clearer?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
There are accomplished people who are not nurtured by their accomplishments, because they 
are accomplished in order to not be something they’re avoiding being.
(to Mike) 
Do you get that?
MIKE
Partially.
ERHARD
Okay, let’s get it completely clear.
MIKE
Okay.
“
 But if you and I are well related in order to 
avoid being angry, the result of being well 
related is not satisfaction and fulfillment: it is 
avoiding being angry.

ERHARD
This is a room full of highly accomplished people. And you know accomplished people?
MIKE
Sure.
ERHARD
And they are not necessarily profoundly satisfi ed, are they?
MIKE
No they’re not.
ERHARD
And they’re not full of joy.
MIKE
No they’re not.
ERHARD
There’s something wrong there. When people see that, like you and me, we start to come up 
with these stupid conclusions. “Well, life isn’t worth it after all. You get all this stuff  done and
so what?” “Is that all there is? I got to be the president of the company,” or “I raised a wonderful 
family. Success is shit. Do what you want.” People give up accomplishment: all these weird solu-
tions. Accomplishment doesn’t work for people because they do it in order not to be something. 
Clear?
MIKE
I get the theory.
ERHARD
Once you get what you call the theory, you want to stand in that theory and look at life. People
who get married in order to not be lonely, even when they are successful in the marriage, sim-
ply end up being not lonely, while still being attached to “lonely.” This whole big possibility of 
being married or being related, they’re not there. They’re in “lonely.” Clear?
MIKE
That part is clear.
ERHARD
Which part isn’t clear?
MIKE
I’m just trying to digest everything.
NOTE: This is a “hint” toward the conversation near the end 
of Day Three called “There’s something wrong here.”

ERHARD
Don’t try to digest everything. What I want you to do is stand in it and look out in life.
MIKE
How do I do that?
ERHARD
Tell me how to walk. And then I’ll tell you how to do that.
MIKE
Lean forward.
ERHARD
Tell me how to lean forward.
MIKE
Bend your back.
ERHARD
Tell me how to bend my back.
(silence)
The truth is, you don’t know how to walk. You walk, but you don’t know how to walk. You 
don’t walk out of “knowing how.” Even if you studied anatomy and knew every single muscle I 
needed to use, and understood the operation of all the parts of the body, and all the neural path-
ways impulses had to be sent down, you wouldn’t know how to generate them in the fi rst place,
besides which, you couldn’t keep all that in mind to lift one leg up, let alone to walk, right? The
fact is you don’t know how to walk. You just walk.
MIKE
I guess I never looked at it from that point of view.
ERHARD
You never looked at it from that point of view. You don’t need to guess about it. Who you are is 
an “I guess.” You don’t know how to walk, do you?
MIKE
I can walk.

Yes. That’s not in discussion.

MIKE
Yes, I know how to walk.
ERHARD
Okay, tell me.
MIKE
No, I don’t know how to walk.
ERHARD
Okay good.
(to the group)
You’ve all got a lot of stupid notions. You’re a bunch of thoughtless people. You’ve given very 
little thought to anything of signifi cance. You have a lot of thoughts, but you don’t give thought.
So in here, you and I are going to give thought. Like most of the other people on the plan-
et, Mike never stopped to look at whether he knew how to walk: wasn’t too important to his 
walking, so why bother? But in here, some of the things you take for granted, we won’t take
those things for granted. See, it’s common sense that if a person walks they know how to. But 
Mike and I just reduced the idea of knowing how to walk to an absurdity. Maybe knowing how 
is not the pathway. You can’t produce art by the numbers. So getting back to this standing in a
possibility: you think it, not believe it or agree with it. You think it. You think: “people are ac-
complished in-order-to.” So what they get is avoiding the “order-to.” But avoiding the “order-to”
is the same as being attached to the “order-to.” Stand in there and take a look at life from there 
and think that, generate it as a possibility. Speak to yourself or others. Clear?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
Thank you. That was a very useful conversation.
MIKE
Thank you.

ERHARD (returning to Marsha)
So Marsha, you were saying?
MARSHA
I’m angry at everyone in the world, because what I know about each person in the world is that
they don’t like me. I’m angry at them.
Giving and Reflexion
In his use here of the word “gives,” Erhard is employing a term 
that was central in Heidegger’s eff orts to say the relationship of 
language to Being.
For anyone who has participated in the work of Werner Er-
hard, and has experienced the way that a particular combination
of words can make available a new perspective on the world, a
primary delight in reading Heidegger is surrendering to his precise 
and profoundly reflexive languaging. Its frequent circularity is 
consistent with its purpose, which is not to take us anywhere new, 
but to bring us “back to where we already are,” which, he warns, is
“infinitely harder.” His task is to “think Being without beings”—that
is, to bring Being to language as distinct from beings, a distinction
that has been lost to our metaphysical tradition. He wants to say 
Being; his task is therefore “unceasingly to overcome the obstacles
that tend to render such saying inadequate” (OTB 24). 
The Being of Language
One of these obstacles he confronts in undertaking this task is
found in the nature of language itself. Language was increasingly
the focus in Heidegger’s later writing, and his most well-known 
statement is his assertion that “Language is the House of Being”
(“LH” in BW 217). But what about the Being of language itself?
W
Here Heidegger articulates the conundrum:
“
 We speak of language, but constantly seem 
to be speaking merely about language, while 
in fact we are already letting language, from 
within language, speak to us, in language, of 
itself, saying its nature. (“NL” in OWL 85) 
Heidegger’s characteristic response to this aporic puzzle is to 
problematize it further, beginning with a line from the German 
poet Stefan George, which reasserts his own view of language:
“Where word breaks off  no thing may be.” He teases us into the
paradox created by this statement: if without language things can-
not be, then things are only when the word already is. But is a word 
a thing? On the one hand, it seems so: “if the word is to endow the
thing with being, it too must be before any thing is—thus it must

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
So, “I am ‘they don’t like me’ waiting to happen.” The already always listening I am is “you 
don’t like me, so what was that you were going to say?”
MARSHA
I am already always “you don’t like me.” I’m angry at that.
ERHARD (to the group)
Yeah. And something happened when Marsha was a little girl. And when somebody didn’t like 
her, getting angry worked for that little girl. Now the little girl is running the mature woman
with a lot of relational skills being put to use by a little girl who gets angry because people don’t
like her. There’s a little girl mashed in with a mature and competent woman. And the mashing 
is that the little girl is in charge, calling the shots. And the mature competent woman keeps her
in charge by being afraid she might be angry, and not wanting to be. And see, the people who
can see Marsha now want to make her feel better. I don’t want to make her feel better. I want 
her just like she is, because what she is doing is growing up. She’s getting to the source of what 
she’s afraid she might be. When she’s completed that, she’ll have a freedom to be that she didn’t
have before this conversation. She won’t know better how not to be angry. There’ll be a freedom
that wasn’t there before. She’ll be related to people eff ectively in order to be related to people
eff ectively. That’s fulfi lling. The thing in itself. Anything else?
MARSHA
I suppressed anger starting in the fi fth grade.
ERHARD
What happened?
(to the group)
Listen through the distinctions we developed yesterday. “People don’t like me” never happens.
It’s a story about what happens. “People don’t like me” can’t happen. If you can’t see that, stand 
up?
A participant stood up and takes a microphone.
ERHARD
Lisa, I said, “people don’t like me” never happens.
LISA (smiling)
I get it now.
ERHARD
It never happens, it’s always a story isn’t it? It’s a story about what happened. Larry said you’re
a jerk. He might even have said, “I don’t like you.” That’s what happened, and you told the story 
“people don’t like me.” “People don’t like me” can’t happen, can it?
inescapably be itself a thing” (“NL” in OWL 86). But can a thing
then give being to another thing? If things cannot be without the
prior existence of words, the inevitable conclusion is that “word
and thing are diff erent, even disparate” (“NL” in OWL 86). But what
could be the nature of that diff erence?
Words can be said, but can the word for a word ever be said? A
dictionary is filled with terms, but no words, since “a dictionary can 
neither grasp nor keep the word by which the terms become words
and speak as words.” When we try to think this, Heidegger proposes, 
we seem to arrive at the conclusion that “saying has no being.” But 
then another question presents itself: we say a thing is when a word
is available. But what about the “is” itself? “The ‘is’ cannot be found
anywhere as a thing attached to a thing.” Indeed, “It belongs no more 
among the things that are than does the word” (“NL” in OWL 87).
At this point in our thinking, we may throw in the towel; or, 
says Heidegger, if we will follow him for one more step, we may be
struck by something we had not noticed. While we have reached no
answers in our inquiry—it has raised neither the word nor the “is”
nor the relation between the two to the status of thinghood—it has
pointed us toward something “thought-provoking and memorable.” 
It has suggested the possibility of “what is there and yet ‘is’ not.” 
“
 The word, too, belongs to what is there—per-
haps not merely “too” but first of all, and even
in such a way such that the word, the nature
of the word, conceals within itself that which 
gives [B]eing. If our thinking does justice to 
the matter, then we may never say of the word
that it is, but rather that it gives—not in the 
sense that words are given by an “it,” but that
the word itself gives. (“NL” in OWL 87-88)
Out of the unspoken background, the word gives a context of 
meaning for human action.
Thus we have dug down to the essential simplicity: es gibt (it
t
gives). Heidegger is languaging the Being/being relationship that
is also the heart of his important term, appropriation. As we will 
show later in this book, the nature of appropriation is absolutely 
central to the ultimate rhetorical move of The Forum.

going to work today. You have to be powerfully with people. You’ve got to be up on the edge 
of your chair when this woman is giving you a gift you ain’t going to get again. You’re going to
Werner Erhard, who found in Heidegger’s vocabulary a way of 
expanding the value that his own work made available, discussed 
the nature of giving in a 1989 satellite telecast from New York City.
“
 A distinction gives. It comes into existence 
by giving. . . .  You’ve got to be able to think
something coming into existence in the act
of giving existence. Distinguishing arises in 
the act of giving—hard for us to think about
because we can only think serially. I’m ask-
ing you to think of a new kind of relationship 
called giving. . . . This is getting to the essence
of Being. There’s no such thing as Being. You 
can’t separate Being from the world, therefore 
there’s no such thing as Being. . . . Being arises
in the act of giving. (“Beyond the Winning 
Formula”)
Reflexive languaging demands that thinking bend back on itself.
Such languaging is inherent in thinking about Being; note how that
very phrase tickles the mind. 
While Heidegger’s writing is oft en considered to be highly
complex, he suggests an alternate view: “What is strange in the 
thinking of Being is its simplicity. Precisely this keeps us from it”
(“LH” in BW 263, emphasis added). Heidegger teases out this idea
W
further in his “Letter on Humanism.” At one point in the letter, 
when considering the role of language in Being, he calls attention
to a specific instance of its simplicity:
“
 But just now an example of the inconspicu-
ous deed of thinking manifested itself. For to
the extent that we expressly think the usage
“bring to language,” which was granted to
language, think only that and nothing fur-
ther, to the extent that we retain this thought
in the heedfulness of saying as what in the 
future continually has to be thought, we have 
brought something of the essential unfolding 
of Being itself to language. (“LH” in BW 263)

go back out of here three days from now, and nobody’s gonna talk this straight to you. You’re 
going to go out and have those chicken shit conversations with people. So you want to get what 
you can out of this. And you aren’t going to be able to see this in yourself until you can see it
in Marsha. All that sadness of the fi fth grader is there right now. Marsha’s got a fi fth grader 
running her life. This is a mature, attractive, confi dent, accomplished woman with a fi fth grader 
calling the shots.
(to Marsha)
You were saying?
MARSHA
Suddenly there was a distinction. It was not okay with the other girls that I was not growing up. 
They starting getting in like a clique. And...
ERHARD
Talking behind your back and excluding you, and no longer was there that kind of loose easy 
sense of being with people. Now it was a drama to be with people: a kind of plot; a kind of 
strategy.
MARSHA
What I saw worked a little bit was to start getting happy, bubbly.
ERHARD
So this is pretty intelligent for a fi fth grader. It makes very good sense for a ten-year-old girl to
say the answer to this is to be happy all the time. You got to remember this is Marsha inventing
Marsha. This is Marsha inventing her identity. She has happiness as a way to push away sad-
ness. Then what happened?
MARSHA
As we grew up, they were the attractive ones, the cheerleaders; the boys were interested in 
them...
ERHARD
Listen up here, because this is about to get really stupid. Here is a really attractive woman who’s 
going to tell you she was not in with the girls who were attractive. Stupid in the sense that this 
is not logical.
MARSHA
Up until the fi fth grade I was called ___, after my ninety year old aunt who was an “old maid.”
ERHARD (to the group, lightly)
How come men are bachelors and women are called old maids? I don’t get it.
ERHARD (continuing)
In considering reflexive languaging, one is immediately reminded
of koan meditation—the process in which a Zen student is assigned
a single problematic phrase upon which he or she meditates until 
its embedded ontological hurdle has been made. The paradigmatic 
koan is the question, “What is the sound of one hand clapping?”
Heidegger’s paragraph above, considered carefully, pulls one
toward koan-like thinking.
Michael E. Zimmerman has likened Heidegger’s use of 
aporia—unresolvable problems—to the existential puzzles found
in koans. As an example, he cites the aporic conceptual dilem-
ma, central to Heidegger’s thought, that Being is inconceivable 
except as a being, and yet no being can be a being without a prior 
experience of its Being. As Zimmerman points out, the solution
to such aporia is beyond the capabilities of rational thought; and 
this is precisely the power of reflexion, that it turns the thinker’s
thinking reflexively in upon itself, demanding a diff erent kind of 
d
thinking and thus a diff erent thinker: “Before one can speak about 
the diff erence between Being and beings, it is crucial that one put 
oneself in the position of being able to experience that diff erence”
(“Heidegger and Heraclitus on Spiritual Practice” 100). Participants
in The Forum have put themselves in that position.
The experience of engaging one’s mind with a profoundly
relexive idea may be imagined as the process of revving an engine 
so hard that the torque sends it flying off  its mounts. This image 
calls to our minds the way participants in The Forum “get it” aft er 
several days of struggling to understand it conceptually.
Reflexive languagings, and the thinking they demand, are cen-
tral in the work of both Heidegger and Erhard. Erhard distinguishes 
thinking from having thoughts, and he hints at the diff erence using 
such languaging as “This statement is false,” “I always lie,” or “A
superstition is a superstition only when it isn’t a superstition, and
a superstition isn’t a superstition only when it is a superstition.”
Such statements call for thinking, call for the movement of thought
l
through the structure given in language. ■

That’s when I changed my name to Marsha. I wouldn’t answer to that other name any more.

who were really happy, not like you.

and who shook her head in response to each of Erhard’s questions.
ERHARD (continuing)
Is this hitting close to home? Popularity wasn’t your thing? What did you care? You have a chip
on your shoulder? If I asked your friends if you had a chip on your shoulder, what would they

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Listen carefully. What Marsha’s telling you doesn’t belong to her. That bullshit is all over the 
place. It’s a rainstorm. It’s all over the place: that bullshit about being stretched too thin. You
ain’t ever going to be big enough to operate in a way that doesn’t leave you unnurtured and too
thin. You’re going to die disappointed, because you aren’t ever going to accomplish enough to be 
fulfi lled when accomplishment is there in-order-to. All you’re doing is building dissatisfaction that
accomplishment is designed to avoid. It looks like a big pile of satisfaction. I mean, here’s a wom-
an who was successful as an older child; successful in college. Extraordinarily successful raising 
six children, married to a great guy: and it’s making her “thin.” It makes you thin when those
accomplishments are in-order-to. It ought to be making her “thicker” not “thinner.” They make
you thinner when they’re not fulfi lling, when they’re not enlivening, when they’re a strategy.
(to Marsha)
What else?
MARSHA
Here I am today.
ERHARD
You’re in the right place.
(applause)
You aren’t going to be around that much honesty for the most part. What you and I did yes-
terday was put together a structure in which it is possible to be honest. You need to develop a
language for honesty. You can’t be honest in everyday language. It’s not designed for honesty.
You and I have been building a structure of distinctions designed for honesty. So you and I have 
been building a language, a set of distinctions, building a structure where it is possible to be
honest. You’ve got to be a big person to be authentic about your inauthenticity. Being authentic 
about your inauthenticity gives you being big. There’s no “big” inside of Marsha. No qualities 
in there. What you and I describe as “qualities” arise in the moment of action. Someone who is
authentic about their own inauthenticity is giving themselves being big. Is that clear to you?
(returning to participant who remained seated without a mic)
There are no big people in here, because people are neither big nor small. They’re just people. 
And when you’re authentic about your inauthenticity, it gives you being big. If she already had
the quality in there, that would be like being tall. If big were inside us, there wouldn’t be any-
thing very interesting about that, would there? Big arises in the acting. On the common sense
view, what would it occur to you to do with your inauthenticity? Hide it. Stamp it out. Change
it. Fix it. Repair it. The way you already always are about your inauthenticity is something 
across the spectrum from fi x it, not-be-it, shove it down, across the spectrum to hide it. The idea 
to share it would never occur to you. The idea to dump it on others might occur to you because 
of the idea you’ve got called “friends.” It’s pure crap, what you tell your friends, pure crap. Be-
cause what do you tell your friends? The story. They have no respect for you so they sympathize 
with you. They think you’re crap, just the same as you do, and that’s sad. And the appropriate
for an ontological entity, such as a human identity, the essential
survival requirements are being right and looking good, which 
together justify and maintain whatever way we wound up being.
Both of these elements are addressed here during the second 
day of The Forum. Being right is proposed as one of the primary 
payoff s in the structure of a racket; and the discussion of looking
good grows out of the assignment given at the end of the first day, 
when participants were told to locate the places in their life where
they were being “used by looking good.” Both of these distinctions 
are essential elements of the model Erhard is creating in order to 
deconstruct our Cartesian understanding and reveal the clearing
for a new possibility of being human.
Heidegger has likewise proposed a structure for understand-
ing human Being (Dasein) in terms of its domination by a concern 
for the opinions of others. His rubric for this structure is das Man.
In the standard translation of Being and Time, this phrase is ren-
dered as the “they,” and here Heidegger describes the situation:
“
 [Dasein] itself is not; its Being has been taken
away by the Others. . . . These Others, more-
over, are not definite Others. On the contrary, 
any Other can represent them. What is de-
cisive is just that inconspicuous domination 
by Others which has already been taken over 
unawares from Dasein as Being-with. . . . The 
“who” is not this one, not that one, not one-
self, not some people, and not the sum of them 
all. The ‘who’ is the neuter, the “they.y ” (BT 164)
Hubert Dreyfus proposes that to translate das Man in this way 
suggests that I am to be distinguished from them. But the point is
that the “they” has taken me over, so that in being dominated by
the “they” I am one of them. Therefore Dreyfus prefers the trans-
lation “the One”; that is, we don’t conform to the norms because 
“they” do it, but because “it’s what one does” (BITW 151–152). 
W
Says Heidegger: “In this inconspicuousness and unascertainability,
the real dictatorship of the ‘they’ is unfolded” (BT 164). As a result,
T
Dasein loses itself in the ways of Being of the “they,” and the Self of 
everyday Dasein becomes the they-self.

response to that is sympathy. Awww, you poor thing. Marsha, thank you very much. And you
want to be clear that when Marsha sits down some of what didn’t resolve for her while she was 
standing up, although she was pretty complete about that, the rest of that will resolve for her.
See it’s like a house of cards: when you take one of the cards out, the whole thing falls down.
That whole thing that’s tied together begins to break apart. There’s more attached to that, that
Marsha didn’t tell us. She hasn’t looked all the way through it, and doesn’t want to be up there
for a half hour telling the whole thing. She already gave you one insight. Anger was related to
“people don’t like me.” And “I’m angry at people for not liking me.” So you fi nd the anger and
see that what’s attached to that is “people don’t like me.” And what’s attached to that is I’ve got 
to be likeable, and then you get really good at being likeable. Not in some cheap sense, not with 
smoke and mirrors; earned like. She produced the results, earned the contribution. Put out the
energy. And she’s gotten really good at it.
(moving among the participants on the fl oor)
The problem is that when it’s there in order to avoid not being liked, about which I’m angry...
Accomplishment doesn’t leave you nurtured. That’s why they have happy hours after work. The
way people relate to their job, accomplishment in their job doesn’t nurture them.
(turning to a participant who had been standing the entire time)
JODIE
Interesting how much things have changed since I stood up.
ERHARD
Amazing, right?
JODIE
Looking good rules my life: completely and utterly.
ERHARD
If you haven’t seen yet that looking good owns your life... if you haven’t seen that yet... I prom-
ise you that that’s the case. You may not have seen it yet. So you don’t know that it is the case. 
Like I said, I don’t know the truth, but I’m also not a guy in a diner about this, not a guy with 
an opinion. If you haven’t seen this you want to be listening up. Like Mike and I were saying,
you want to listen to this like a possibility...that when Jodie’s fi nished, you want to stand in the 
possibility that you don’t own your life, that your life doesn’t belong to you. Yeah, you’ve got 
this arrogant façade that you run your life and call the shots. Listen to Jodie’s sharing out of this 
possibility: to see how your life is shaped by looking good. And the quality of your life is that
of a life devoted to looking good. Your actions are limited to the span of action being given by 
looking good. Stand in that possibility when Jodie is fi nished.
JODIE
What also came up from yesterday when you talked about concept and experience and rein-
forcing each other, my whole life is, that I’ve got to look good and if I don’t look good it doesn’t
Heidegger specifies other characteristics of the “they” which 
thereby become aspects of our everydayness. First, because we 
generally encounter others in the context of our everyday con-
cerns—the competitive environment of the workplace, as well as 
the social and political realms—we experience “constant care as 
to the way one diff ers from them, whether one’s own Dasein has 
lagged behind the Others and wants to catch up in relationship
to them, or whether one’s Dasein has priority over them and sets 
out to keep them suppressed” (BT 164–165). As this complex of 
T
concerns takes Dasein over, the withness of Being-with-Others is
interrupted:
“
 The care about this distance between them is 
disturbing to Being-with-one-another, though 
this disturbance is one that is hidden from 
it. If we may express this existentially, such 
Being-with-one-another has the character of 
distantiality. (BT 164)
Further, since the “they” is everyone and no one, it is characterized 
as well by averageness:
“
 Thus the “they” maintains itself factically 
in the averageness of that which belongs to 
it, of that which it regards as valid and that
which it does not, and of that to which it grants 
success and that to which it denies it. In this 
averageness with which it prescribes what 
can and may be ventured, it keeps watch over 
everything exceptional that thrusts itself to 
the fore. Every kind of priority gets noiseless-
ly suppressed. Overnight, everything that is 
primordial gets glossed over as something that 
has long been well known. Everything gained 
by a struggle becomes just something to be
manipulated. Every secret loses its force. This 
care of averageness reveals in turn an essential 
tendency of Dasein which we call the “levelling 
down” of all possibilities of Being. (BT 165)

come off  well, and that reinforces that I’ve got to look good. And it just goes
around and around.
ERHARD
So when you don’t look good, it reinforces looking good, and when you do
look good, that reinforces looking good.
JODIE
And that there’s been times in my life where, that looking good prevents me 
from expressing what I want to express. I could go home to my intimate rela-
tionship and I could go home alone and say “okay, at least I look good.”
ERHARD
Yeah. Listen. Your little $625, that’s chicken shit compared to what you just 
got from her. You can’t buy that kind of honesty. That’s more insight than most 
people are ever going to have in their entire life. What she told you is that you
don’t own your life.  Looking good owns your life. And life is not about self-ex-
pression. You now know why there’s no satisfaction in your success. Looking
good is gratifying, but not fulfi llment. You notice it’s never enough. Nothing is
ever enough. Nothing. Nothing leaves you whole and complete, nothing leaves 
you full of joy. Because that’s not the name of the game. The name of the
game is looking good. It’s the only game in town. You are not living life. You 
are looking good. Of course, some people look good by looking bad. A lot of 
people look good by being the victim. For example, if you screw up someplace 
when you’re a kid and get a lot of attention. People who are unable. It’s a way 
of life. There’s an organ for some people called dealing with electrical things,
and they don’t have that organ, you see.
(laughter)
Not long ago they burned women to death in Scotland as a favor because their
souls were possessed. The best people in the community applied the tests to 
see if a woman’s soul was possessed by a devil. A lot of what you know to 
be true is in the same order as what those Scots knew that led them to burn
women to death. One of those things that isn’t true is that you own your life,
because you don’t. One of those things that isn’t true is that you’re free, but
you’re not. You’re owned by looking good.
JODIE
For me what happened was I was unattractive as a child. I was 5 feet 8 inches 
at 12 years old. I always stood out in a crowd, was gawky and all that. Always
popular with the girls and never with the boys. Unattractive all the way through
high school. And when I was 17 the transformation took place. I lost 35 pounds, 
got contact lenses and a professional haircut. All of a sudden men liked me.
What showed up for me was that when I was young men didn’t like me.
Collectively, these ways of being—distantiality, averageness, and
levelling down—constitute what Heidegger calls “Publicness,” 
which
“
 controls every way in which the world and Da-
sein get interpreted, and it is always right—not 
because there is some distinctive and primary 
relationship-of-Being in which it is related 
to ‘Things,’ or because it avails itself of some 
transparency on the part of Dasein which it 
has explicitly appropriated, but because it is 
insensitive to every diff erence of level and of 
genuineness and thus never gets to the ‘heart 
of the matter.’ (BT 165, emphasis added)
Finally, although all of this would seem to paint an unrelieved-
ly bleak picture for Dasein’s possibility of Being-in-the-world, there
is one more element that, at first glance, might seem to provide 
some relief, and might (initially at least) be called “the upside of 
the they-self.” In Werner Erhard’s model, it is in fact one of the 
“payoff s” in the structure of a racket:
“
 [B]ecause the “they” presents every judgment 
and decision as its own, it deprives the particu-
lar Dasein of its answerability. The “they” can, 
as it were, manage to have ‘them’ constantly 
invoking it. . . . It ‘was’ always the “they” who 
did it, and yet it can be said that it has been 
‘no one.’ . . . .Thus the particular Dasein in its 
everydayness is disburdened by the “they.” Not 
only that; by thus disburdening it of its Being, 
the “they” accommodates Dasein if Dasein has 
any tendency to take things easily and make 
them easy. (BT 165) 
And what Dasein wouldn’t want to make things easy? Avoidance
of responsibility for one’s situation, and off -loading of blame

Forum Day Two: Session One

ERHARD
Now is that true? Did that ever happen? “Men don’t like me?” Is it true “I’m not attractive”? Is
that true? Could that be true? Who said yes? “Not attractive” could happen? Stand up. I want 
you to tell me how that could happen.
SAM
I could make it up that I’m not attractive.
ERHARD
Oh, that’s a story. “Not attractive” can’t happen. Did you ever wonder, “that guy is so unattractive.
How did he ever get that woman? She must be blind.” Do you know that attraction is the weirdest 
stuff  in the universe? Everybody’s attractive. A lot of people don’t troll their bait, that’s all. So if 
your story is that “I’m tall and gawky and not attractive,” you don’t have your bait out. I would be
willing to bet that there isn’t anybody for whom there are no fi sh, given what I’ve seen. You begin
to live out of a story that you’re not attractive. Don’t tell me there are no fi sh if you’re not trolling.
(to Jodie)
You were saying?
JODIE
So I got attractive. And I know that I can walk into a room and every man will look at me.
That’s happened for me.
ERHARD
Nothing’s changed about being tall, right? Tall is now attractive. Same stuff . I want to get this
clear with you. You gotta get this.
Erhard walked to the blackboard, and drew two circles. One circle he labeled “attractive,” one he 
labeled “not attractive.” He wrote “tall” in both.
(continuing)
The way things are is not determined by the way things are. That’s hard to think, so that’s what
I’m asking you to think. The way things are is determined by the context in which things occur.
t
I’m wanting you to begin to see that this part—the circle, the context—is critically important.
I’m saying that the circumstances never produce problems. I don’t care what happened in your
r
life. That’s not the problem. I don’t care if you were raped when you were a little girl or you 
were molested when you were a little boy. I don’t care who’s sitting there with cancer. I know 
you think that did something bad to you. I’m saying no. The circumstances never are the prob-
lem. Tall occurs as not attractive in one context, in one domain of existence, and tall occurs as
attractive in another domain of existence. Anybody not get that? It’s never what happened that’s 
the problem. I don’t care what’s happened in your life. That is not the problem. The problem is 
the context in which “what happened” occurred.
(to Jodie)
Yes, you were saying...
onto someone or something else whom you can make wrong, is 
a significant payoff  of one’s racket, a distinction that has been
mentioned several times but will not be distinguished until the
next session. 
Aside from the payoff , the structure of a racket has another 
element: the cost. And here Heidegger names it: “[B]ecause the 
‘they’ constantly accommodates the particular Dasein by disbur-
dening it of its Being, the ‘they’ retains and enhances its stubborn 
dominion” (BT 165). Through its surrender to the domination of 
T
the “they,” Dasein has embraced the Cartesian security of being 
right in its averageness; but it has at the same time sacrificed its 
freedom and power. As The Forum participant Jodie states, “look-
ing good rules my life.”
In these “characters of Being,” says Heidegger, we find “the
‘constancy’ of Dasein which is closest to us” (BT 166). Certainly, the
T
attitudes and behaviors he has presented here are familiar to all
of us—and if we can’t quite recognize them in ourselves, we can 
certainly recognize them in others, or in the culture at large. And 
we must feel some discomfort in acknowledging that his descrip-
tions are so apt.
But straight talk about the way things look now is the essen-
tial first step in gaining a new perspective; and in The Forum, the 
creation of a new possibility must be preceded by a hard look at 
our present way of Being. Heidegger takes us through the steps 
one at a time.
“
 Neither the Self of one’s own Dasein nor the 
Self of the Other has as yet found itself or lost 
itself as long as it is in the modes we have 
mentioned. In these modes one’s way of Being 
is that of inauthenticity and failure to stand 
by one’s Self. (BT 166)
Confronting the reality of the they-self responds to the first question 
of The Forum: “What is the Being of human being?” Authenticity 
and taking a stand become available when the second is addressed: 
“What is the possibility of Being for human being?” ■

SPEAKING BEING
JODIE
When I was a child, I was not liked by boys. That’s my story...
ERHARD
Or boys didn’t say certain things to you. That’s what happened. And boys didn’t act in certain
ways with you. There’s a thousand possible stories: “I was so awesome that those twerps didn’t 
have the balls to say to me what they said to those little girls.”
JODIE
That’s what I say now.
ERHARD
All I’m trying to point out is that a story is just a story. The “what happened,” that’s what’s true 
or not. It did or it didn’t. Mostly true. Because she wouldn’t have even noticed boys not saying
or acting a certain way unless her listening was “boys don’t like me.” If your listening is that 
somebody doesn’t like you, everything they say is an expression of not liking you. If we pushed 
Jodie hard enough she could go back and remember that “oh yeah, one of them was trying to be 
nice to me once.” Something like that.
JODIE
So I got attractive and, men asked me out. What I fi nd now is that as an adolescent I believed
that men didn’t like me, so when I got attractive it was like a shell I was putting on.
ERHARD
This is good. I got to stop you because they are listening like this is a soap opera and they need
to listen deeply.
(to the group)
If you’re attractive to make up for not being attractive... if who you really are is unattractive, but
they don’t know that, every time you are attractive, what you are left with is being unattractive. 
When you change unattractive to attractive, what persists is unattractive. It’s a con game, under-
neath which is unattractive. There’s no object that has the quality “attractive.” There’s no being
fulfi lled in being attractive. There’s stuff  in my house I think is wonderful, the dog walks right by.
JODIE
When someone tells me “You’re really beautiful,” what comes up for me is “but you don’t 
really know me.” When I go home I take this off  and there’s the real me and you won’t like that 
person.
ERHARD
Here’s what you want to get: nobody wants to know that about themselves. Nobody wants to 
get that really underneath it all they’re really unattractive. That’s why you paid $625. Because
in here, it’s structured so you can get at that—to the degree that Jodie can be with this, and she 
“
  All I’m trying to point out is that a story is just 
a story. The “what happened,” that’s what’s 
true or not. It did or it didn’t. Mostly true.

doesn’t screw it up by trying to fi x it. If all she does is just be with it, there will be a whole new 
possibility in attraction. It’ll be a diff erent thing for her. That will not be the limit of attraction.
JODIE
I’ve buried me. I’ve buried it so much, I don’t even know what’s there anymore. I don’t want to
take it out and look at it.
ERHARD (to Jodie)
That’s really very beautiful, what you saw: really extraordinary. It took me about ten years to 
get what you got overnight. What you begin to see here is that when the name of the game
is looking good, there is no self-expression. None. So whatever there is, whatever quality life 
would have, if life were self-expression, it doesn’t have that when life is looking good. And life is
looking good.
(to the group)
You aren’t going to get any clearer than she gave it to you. I’m going to talk about it a lot. But
she gave it to you real clearly.
(to Jodie)
What else?
JODIE
It all comes down to wanting to be liked. And what shows up for me in relationships and espe-
cially work relationships, I put on this story: “I don’t care if I’m liked, I want to be respected.”
ERHARD
Anybody who tells you that is full of shit. What they really mean is that they’re not sure about
being liked. They don’t know whether they can play that game. They got more confi dence about
being respected. Everybody wants to be liked. It’s nothing personal about you. It’s a rainstorm
called the already always being of human beings. And it is in the nature of being of human be-
ings to have a powerful concern for being liked. And there are endless strategies for dealing with
this powerful addiction to looking good. People who say they don’t care about being liked: if you
don’t care then why are you telling me? You didn’t say you didn’t care if I blink my eyes. Why 
did you go out of your way to say you don’t care if I like you? “Methinks the lady doth protest 
too much.” It’s not personal. Can we get that fl at now? It’s not personal. You don’t have a fuck-
ing thing to do with it, nothing. You didn’t make that up. It belongs to the already always being
of human being. You just happened to walk into the rainstorm called being a human being, and
as such you got wet by that rain. You personally want to be liked, have to be liked, need to be
liked, are addicted to being liked. But it’s nothing personal, and treating it personally is stupid
and it will make you stupid. Some people are guilty about wanting to be liked. You’re guilty of 
being a human being, that’s all. You need to know it’s an ontological phenomenon, a phenome-
non of being. And it doesn’t belong to you personally, it belongs to being human, as you do.
“
  What you begin to see here is that when the 
name of the game is looking good, there is no 
self-expression. None. So whatever there is, 
whatever quality life would have, if life were 
self-expression, it doesn’t have that when life 
is looking good. And life is looking good.

SPEAKING BEING
While Jodie remained standing, another participant, Max, who had the story about Vietnam, stood
to speak.
MAX (visibly shaking)
I’m stuck. I’m afraid I won’t get it. I want to pay my money and have you give it to me. I don’t 
want to have to work at it. I’m really controlled by looking good. I know it controls my life.
I’m living my life for everybody else, not myself. I’m stuck and I don’t know what to do with
that right now. I’m pissed off  at myself when you asked if there was anybody who didn’t get
authenticity...
ERHARD
About being inauthentic.
MAX
I’m stuck on that. I don’t know where to go with it. I don’t understand it.
ERHARD
All right. I got it. You’re in the right place. Relax. I mean, I know you won’t relax, but you’re in 
the right place. I just read your thermometer. You’re all right.
JODIE
I’m really concerned about people liking me, but it’s not me that I’m portraying for them to like
anyway. There’s this big catch 22. I really want you to like me, but it’s not the real me anyway so
if you don’t like me, I already have an out.
ERHARD
Right. It’s very illogical. Very nutty. What’s that thing about lies and webs? “Oh what a tangled
web we weave, when fi rst we practice to deceive.” You have no idea how tangled it is. It starts 
with the fi rst lie, and the fi rst lie is: the story is true. Very powerful contribution. Thanks.
Jodie sat to applause. Wes then replaced Erhard on the platform and directed participants to engage
in a few minutes of “paired sharing—sharing with the person seated next to you what you have 
been seeing in The Forum so far today.”  Following this, he gave the group an assignment for the 
upcoming break.
WES
Have a conversation, like an inquiry, with at least one other person about your racket. I want
you to consider the possibility that you are a candy store with a racket in the back. Rackets have
t
a cost and a payoff . What are yours? Get some insight into your racket—what the payoff  is and
what it costs you. There’s a point to it that gets you something from other people and from life,
and what does that kind of way of being cost you? Get some insight into your racket. That’s the 
opportunity of the break.
The fi rst break of the day began at 12:35 pm.

SPEAKING BEING
“Proximally” is a term Heidegger uses frequently in Being and Time to characterize 
our most obvious and everyday experiences. These experiences, he says, do not 
include a perception of Being, which remains hidden, even though it constitutes 
the meaning and ground of what shows itself. Therefore, when defined by its sub-
ject-matter, “phenomenology is the science of the Being of entities—ontology” 
(BT 61). For Heidegger’s phenomenology “the thing itself” (which of course is not a 
T
thing at all) is Being.
A further complication for the phenomenological approach is that for Heide-
gger it must always be recognized as hermeneutical. Hermeneutics is the study of 
interpretation, the process by which we develop an understanding of a phenome-
non. We can never get to “the things themselves,” says Heidegger, since perception 
is always mediated by the understanding of the human being doing the perceiving,
and that understanding has always been arrived at by a process of interpretation.
Thus by defining his phenomenological method as hermeneutical, Heidegger is
including his recognition that whatever understanding he arrives at will never be the
“final” one: “For in such an inquiry, one is constantly compelled to face the possibil-
ity of disclosing an even more primordial and more universal horizon from which we 
may draw the answer to the question, “What is Being?” (BT 49). 
T
This lack of closure that characterizes a hermeneutical phenomenology is
important for both Heidegger and for the work of Werner Erhard. Heidegger’s stated
goal is to let Dasein “put itself into words for the very first time, so that it may decide 
SESSION ONE INTERVAL
Hermeneutic Phenomenology
Heidegger’s analysis of Dasein in Being and Time is based in two philosophical orien-
tations: phenomenology and hermeneutics.
Heidegger’s introduction to phenomenology as a philosophical method came 
by way of Heidegger’s mentor and colleague, Edmund Husserl, who summarized the 
approach with his famous exhortation, “To the things themselves!” In Heidegger’s 
characteristic reformulation of this approach, phenomenology means “to let that
which shows itself be seen from itself in the very way in which it shows itself from
itself” (BT 58). Both statements point to phenomenology’s fundamental purpose:
T
to set aside all previous theoretical and philosophical constructions (Husserl called
this “bracketing”), in order to bring the phenomena fully into the light.
Of course, Heidegger acknowledges, this purpose may be seen as “abundantly 
self-evident,” since it states “the underlying principle of any scientific knowledge 
whatsoever” (BT 50). And certainly phenomenology, as both a philosophical ori-
T
entation and a method of inquiry, is suff iciently flexible to have been subjected to
widely varying interpretations (see, e.g., www.phenomenologyonline.com). (Note: 
Although at the time of this 1989 Forum Werner Erhard did not present his work 
using the term “phenomenological,” his later projects, as well as the recent work of 
Landmark Worldwide, have employed this term.)
But regardless of the term’s inexactness, Heidegger is adamant that a rigorous
phenomenological inquiry can penetrate the layers of appearance and semblance
which normally impede our access to things. Heidegger’s goal in the inquiry is 
aletheia, or unconcealment, which for the early Greek philosophers was the truth of 
“pure sensory perception,” prior to any judgment or covering-up. Phenomenology 
perceives things “just by looking at them,” thereby (in a phrase employed by both
Heidegger and Werner Erhard) “letting beings be.”
Since Heidegger’s inquiry is concerned with the meaning of Being, his phenom-
enology has a specific character:
“
    What is it that by its very essence is necessarily the theme
y
whenever we exhibit something explicitly? Manifestly, it 
is something that proximally and for the most part does 
not show itself at all: it is something that lies
t
hidden, in 
contrast to that which proximally and for the most part 
does show itself; but at the same time it is something 
that belongs to what shows itself, and it belongs to it 
so essentially as to constitute its meaning and its 
ground. (BT 59)

Forum Day Two: Session One Interval 117
of its own accord whether, as the entity which it is, it has that state of Being which 
is disclosed in this interpretation” (BT 362). But really, isn’t it more accurate to say
T
that the words into which Dasein is being put are Heidegger’s words (and likewise, 
Erhard’s words)? Heidegger is creating his own hermeneutical vocabulary here. Why 
should we accept these terms as valid?
Heidegger is not arguing that we should. He is not proposing a final truth, but 
a step on the way, and he asks that we—as ourselves Dasein—decide “of our own 
accord” whether we find value in his interpretation. This is always the way that 
thinking advances—through the development and testing of new vocabularies. In
the field of psychology, Freud invented a vocabulary to describe the behaviors he
observed in his work. He did not “discover” the ego and the id, but invented them, 
and for decades they demonstrated their validity through their use by generations of 
psychotherapists. More recently, they have been largely supplanted by other vocab-
ularies, or by psychotropic drugs; and many of Freud’s terms have taken their place
in our everyday usage, where excessive neatness is routinely characterized as “anal” 
behavior, and an inflated ego is considered as natural as a sore elbow.
Werner Erhard regularly frames his work as a new vocabulary to be consid-
ered. “We ask you not to believe anything that’s said in here,” he tells The Forum 
participants at the outset of the four days. Instead, he says on numerous occasions,
“consider the possibility,” or “stand in that theory and look at life,” or “try it on.”
¥
In the passage below, taken from an audiotaped 1986 seminar, we present an 
example of Erhard’s phenomenological approach that is quite diff erent from that
demonstrated in The Forum. This seminar is a working session, in which he is inter-
acting with Forum graduates to develop distinctions on the subject of leadership, a 
subject that Erhard has continued to develop in subsequent years into what is now
called the Being a Leader and Exercising Leadership Eff ectively Course: An Onto-
logical/Phenomenological Approach. His method here is oft en framed in a sports
metaphor, in which the ideas to be “bracketed” are characterized as the comments 
of observers (“up in the stands”), while “the things themselves” are the events as 
they are experienced by those engaged in the game (“down on the court”). 
ERHARD
What’s on the court when you’re on the court, rather than what’s on the court 
when you’re up in the stands? What’s actually there like a presence? Peter?
PETER
Me watching somebody else.
ERHARD
Okay, very good. So if we stand back from the whole thing, there was you in 
the stands watching somebody else. Now, you notice something down with 
the people you were watching, which is the comment of an observer giving an 
account. When you were giving that account, what was the guy and the gal on
the court . . . what was present?
PETER
(Silence)
ERHARD
Now let me give you a little clue about how to do this. One of the things that I 
imagine was present was somebody. Is that true? There was actually somebody
there. . . . You don’t get leadership on an empty court. . . .  So this is kind of 
obvious, but at least it’s a place to start: that leadership as a presence is people.
Okay. So what else is there, like a presence? People, we got that much. What
else, like a presence, is present?
PETER
There’s action.
ERHARD
Okay, but what action? Okay, let’s just stay with that. There’s action. So leader-
ship as a presence presences itself as action. People in action. . . .
PETER
So all I have is a description of it, an observation.
ERHARD
Good. Now I want you to get down there on the court and tell me what’s there. 
So far what you’ve got down there is people in action.
PETER
So there’s . . . commitment.

PETER
Anything I can think of is a description.
ERHARD
Yeah, it’s okay. That’s right. And every time you say it, I’m going to say that’s a
description, and what’s underneath that? Why? Because—you know, I’m going 
to say this a thousand times today, I can feel it coming—because it’s the inquiry 
where the power is, not the information you derive from the inquiry. Look, 
we’ve invented a new technology. We’ve invented a technology called ontologi-
cal inquiry. Really, that’s wrong. We’ve invented a technology called ontological
design. The way you do ontological design is like Peter and I are doing it: “May-
be it’s this. But how could it be that? What’s underneath that? Well, underneath
that is this. Okay, but how could it be that? What’s underneath that?” And
somehow, if Peter and I are doing it correctly, when we’re all done, neither of us 
will know anything we didn’t know before, but life will be an opening for that
into which we’ve inquired. So Peter and I will find ourselves, not remembering
what to do to be leaders, or not remembering what property we need to have 
to be leaders, but rather we will find ourselves being leaders. . . . Because I say
that a well-designed, rigorous inquiry, while not leading to answers, while not
leading to information, while not leading necessarily to understanding, leads to
an opening, like a possibility, like a clearing, for that into which I’m inquiring.
ERHARD
No. Can’t see commitment. It’s not a presence. I don’t mean you can’t see it, 
therefore it’s not a presence, but I’m trying to kind of engage you into: how do 
you inquire into presence? So is commitment ever present? No, that’s always a 
conversation, an assessment about what’s going on there. . . . What’s actually 
going on there?
PETER
I don’t know.
ERHARD
Try this: something about unrestrained action? Maybe something like unre-
strained action, maybe something like consistent action? Maybe something like
repetitive action, maybe something like action powerful enough to meet a resis-
tance? I don’t know. See, I don’t know, and I don’t care about the answer! What 
I care about is establishing ourselves in the domain of leadership as a presence. 
That’s what this is all about. It’s a trick. This is not really to get the answer. We’re
not going to give you a test to see if you got the answers right aft erwards. . . .
PETER
It’s action without concern.
ERHARD
Okay. Good. Now, what does concern mean? See, no matter what he says, I’m
going to have a question, aren’t I? Why? Because I don’t care about the answer!

SPEAKING BEING
Erhard was on the platform as the second session began at 1:15 pm.
ERHARD
So I’m willing to tell you The Answer now. You’re not going to like the answer. What you get
after sitting on a mountaintop for twenty years—what you get is—the answer is that there
isn’t any answer: and that is The Answer. Somewhere on the third day that will fall into place
for you. What we want to do is distinguish a racket. The problem is that you don’t know what 
distinguishing is. First we need to distinguish distinction. When you and I distinguish some-
thing, it’s not the same as defi ning it. Distinguishing and defi ning are two diff erent operations.
And distinguishing is not describing. When you distinguish something you are not describing it.
What is it that defi ning does? When you defi ne something, what does that do for you?
PARTICIPANT
You set up a boundary, or a limit.
ERHARD
Right on. When you defi ne something, what you do is to take a mass of undefi ned stuff , and
you draw a kind of line that divides what you’re defi ning from what you’re not defi ning. Also, 
defi ning indicates something with reference to something else, something you’re not familiar 
with in relation to something you are familiar with. Distinguishing doesn’t work like that.
Defi ning objectifi es something. When you defi ne something you turn it into an object. Defi ning 
gives it a form, a location in space and time, turns it into a thing. And we’re all comfortable with
things. When you distinguish you don’t turn it into an object. And that’s why distinguishing
makes people uncomfortable. Because while it exists by virtue of being distinguished, it doesn’t
exist as a thing. 
(pausing)
So we’re going to take a little bit of a look at what distinguishing might be. Defi ning identifi es; 
distinguishing sets up a realm. You don’t need to understand that yet. Just have it like, “He says
distinguishing sets up a realm.” 2, and 9, and 74 are numbers. But number is not itself a num-
r
ber. It’s a realm in which numbers can happen. Number distinguishes a realm of possibility.
Erhard called on a participant to stand up.
ERHARD (to participant)t
How many loops in one square foot of rug?
 PARTICIPANT
A couple thousand.
ERHARD
You know exactly how many: a lot. If I take one loop away, how many are there? The exact same
number. The number is called a lot. We can’t distinguish between that number and that number 
minus one. A lot minus one is still a lot. You have no way to see the diff erence between a lot and

a lot minus one. Conceptually they’re diff erent, but conceptually the world is fl at. We’re talking 
about the way the rug occurs for you. Similarly, we’re told that there are cultures, societies, in 
which the number system goes up to seven.
(holding up eight fi ngers)
That would look like many.
(holding up nine fi ngers)
So would that.
(to the group)
You’ve got to get this, you see. This is one of those things you’ve got to get. Now we’re going to talk 
about two... like t-w-o. Pretend you’re in a culture with no numbers at all. You’ve got only none, 
one, and many.
(holding up two sheets of paper)r
If I said that was two, you’d say, “All right.”
(holding up two rulers)
If I said that’s two, you’d say, “okay.”
He continued, holding up two erasers, then two fi ngers, each time responding with increasing cer-
tainty as the imaginary tribesperson—until he held up one ruler
and one eraser.
ERHARD (continuing)
Can you see that you’d say, “I don’t know”? Two diff erent things would not occur for you as
t
“two.” However, after a few examples of diff erent things as two, you would eventually get that.
(holding up two things in one hand and one thing in the other)r
A new level to get, which would again require demonstration by examples. Then another new 
level.
(holding up one fi nger)r
A set and an empty set. You’d never get this as two. No set of examples, however large, ever 
distinguishes two. It only describes or defi nes two. You can’t invent new twos when you’ve just
got a defi nition of two. When you distinguish two, what you do is create a realm of possibility
in which things can occur, arise, as two. You can’t ever invent without a distinction. Defi nitions
limit, distinctions open up. What you are doing when you are distinguishing is creating, open-
ing up a context in which what you are distinguishing can occur, can happen. Is that starting 
to get clear? What you’re doing now is very diff erent. You are distinguishing distinction. That’s a
little bit like putting your hands underneath your feet and lifting yourself up.
PARTICIPANT
How would you distinguish two?
THINKING 
The kind of thinking that Martin Heidegger was distinguishing in
his writing has not been available for human beings. We can’t think
this way because this way of thinking has not yet been thought 
as a possibility, and therefore it is none of the things which 
already-thought ideas always are: understandable, consistent
within themselves, or consistent with our other thoughts. It is not
yet already-available for assertion or evaluation. It must first be
unconcealed.
Heidegger’s first step in bringing forth this unthought think-
ing is to distinguish our current thinking as “our current thinking”
rather than simply as “thinking.” Essential to an inquiry into the 
possibility of thinking, Heidegger says, is an inquiry into what 
thinking is for us now: what we presently think about thinking,
what we presently define as thinking, and—since our thinking
gives us our being—what we are that thinking is (WCT 17). We must
T
begin to think the diff erence between the possibility of thinking
and whatever it is that we are doing now in the name of thinking,
so that the diff erence becomes the opening for the possibility. The 
development of this distinction—a new way of thinking—is central
to Werner Erhard’s work, as it is to Heidegger’s; therefore we will 
mention here several of the ways in which Heidegger characterizes
the thinking he is attempting.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
We’ll get to that. Here’s what I want you to get fi rst. Distinguishing establishes a domain of possi-
bility, is making possible, not giving form to, but making form possible; very important to get that 
diff erence. Be in this conversation: distinction or distinguishing is an operation unlike defi ning, ex-
plaining. It does not lead to understanding. You do not understand two when you have distinguished 
two. Distinction is an action which leads to power, because it creates possibility, which is freedom.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader
(
)r
What is the diff erence between occurring and distinguishing?
ERHARD
Occurring happens in a realm distinguished. There are cultures in which, we are told, if you 
show people a photographic image they don’t see it. These people, by the way, survive an 
environment you would die in, so they’re probably not stupid. There’s no image on the paper 
or in your brain. These cultures have never generated the possibility “photographic image,”
and so they see splotches on the paper. If you explain it to them, they don’t see an image but a 
representation of an image. Where does the image happen? It happens in the distinction “pho-
tographic image.” In that domain of possibility arises “photographic image.”
”
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader
(
)r
I would like you to tease this out for me a bit more. Using the example, when you’re distin-
guishing two with any objects, and then it now occurs as two. So when you give me examples of 
that, the occurrence now is determining how it occurs for me.
ERHARD
No. The defi nition is determining its occurring. 
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader
(
)r
So it’s a concept.
ERHARD
Yeah. And what you get is a conceptually driven occurring. And isn’t that the way you learned 
mathematics? You weren’t creative or generative in mathematics. Mathematicians learn math at
the level of distinctions, not at the level of defi nition. Consequently, they invent numbers. They 
are not limited by arithmetic; they are freed by arithmetic, because arithmetic is constituted
by distinctions not by defi nitions. Arithmetic is not conceptual for them. Art is conceptual for
most people. Artists don’t generate art conceptually. If they do, that’s not art. That’s handicraft, 
not art. You can’t create out of concepts, defi nitions. Dancers don’t dance out of explanations of 
dance. They generate it out of a domain of possibility in which they can invent forms. What’s 
present when a dancer is dancing is an occurring allowed by the possibility, not an occurring
allowed by the conception. You start doing the same thing over and over again when your art is
reduced to a concept. That’s painting by the numbers.
Fundamentally, this thinking is a response to an appeal. The
appeal arises from the wavering in appearance of Being, from its 
tendency in the act of appearing to disappear. “Nature loves to 
hide,” says the common translation of a fragment of Heraclitus,
the pre-Socratic Greek thinker (Wheelwright 70), which Heidegger 
retranslates to emphasize his reading of physis (pronounced foo’-
sis): “Being (emerging appearance) intrinsically inclines toward 
self-concealment” (IM 126). Thus the essential—Being, that which
must be thought—turns away. Being withdraws. And although
Heidegger acknowledges that for contemporary humans this with-
drawal is now almost unnoticed, nevertheless as beings, we are. 
Therefore at some level we are always turned toward that missing 
aspect of our existence:
 What withdraws from us, draws us along by its
very withdrawal, whether or not we become
aware of it immediately, or at all. Once we are
drawn into the withdrawal, we are drawing
toward what draws, attracts us by its with-
drawal. And once we, being so attracted, are 
drawing toward what draws us, our essential
nature already bears the stamp of “drawing
toward.” (WCT 9)
“
This is the exigence in the background of our lives. We are drawn 
toward the ongoing concealment of Being, and in being so drawn 
we find ourselves pointing in its direction: “We are who we are by 
pointing in that direction—not like an incidental adjunct but as . . . 
an essential and therefore constant pointing toward what with-
draws” (WCT 9, emphasis added).
T
The way to draw toward that which withdraws is through
y
thinking, since “Being in general gets interpreted on the basis of 
thinking” (IM 129), but not in the ordinary way we understand
thinking. To think is “to lend a hand to the essence, the coming to 
presence, of Being” (“TT” in QCT 40). When we are thinking we are
T
looking and drawing toward what withdraws: “Whenever man is
properly drawing that way, he is thinking—even though he may 
still be far away from what withdraws, even though the withdrawal

PARTICIPANT (Forum leader
(
)r
So occurrence can be constitutive of distinguishing?
ERHARD
No. The other way around and constitutive is not the right word. Allowed by is better. Occur-
ring is allowed by the distinction in which it occurs. The occurring is possible by virtue of the
domain of possibility which you have established. For instance, the photographic image doesn’t 
occur in the brain or in the eyes. Those were operational before. The occurring happens in a 
“house called possibility.” Possibility is a product of an operation called distinguishing.

ANOTHER PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 2

I have a sense that there’s an architecture, or whatever word you want to use, so that in order 
to objectify something, you have to be able to locate it, someplace, sometime, some form, some 
architecture for defi nition. Is there an architecture for distinguishing?
ERHARD
I’m not clear about your use of the word architecture.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 2
(
)
Anatomy or elements.
ERHARD
At one end of the spectrum is design, at the other end is making. Anatomy is at the making 
end. What’s up at the design end, mostly lives in what will remain unsaid. Although present by 
virtue of... all that...
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 2
(
)
Is it possible to elevate or transform a concept to a distinction, and create a possibility?
ERHARD
That’s moving from anatomy to design. When you deal with distinction, with design, there’s
something inherently satisfying about that. There’s something inherently satisfying in master-
ing something, and mastery and distinction are synonymous.
(to the group)
Whatever it is, what are you going to use it for? To look good. The problem is, you can’t use dis-
tinctions. Distinctions use you, you don’t use them. Distinctions give you. Not many people own 
a yellow car, right?  Buy a yellow car and see how many yellow cars you see. We’re developing

may be as veiled as ever” (WCT 17). Therefore Heidegger says of 
T
Socrates: “All through his life and right up to his death, Socrates
did nothing else than place himself into this draft , this current, and
maintain himself in it. That is why he is the purest thinker of the 
West” (WCT 17).
T
The relationship of thinking to Being is easily conceived in
familiar Cartesian terms: “Being is the objective, the object. Think-
ing is the subjective, the subject. The relation of thinking to Being
is that of subject to object” (IM 150). Such a conception, however,
keeps us stuck in one of the primary dualities of metaphysical
thought. Heidegger finds an alternative view in a fragment from 
the Greek thinker Parmenides: to gar auto noein estin te kai einai, 
which has been translated, traditionally and (says Heidegger) inad-
equately, as “thinking and Being are the same” (IM 152). In fact, the 
relation between thinking and Being is much subtler than simple
“identity,” and it is the development of the nature of this relation 
which is at the center of Heidegger’s later thought. In Werner 
Erhard’s work, this relation is explored persistently in the dialogue
of The Forum.
Heidegger emphasizes that the way to thinking is not think-
ing about thinking, a practice that has flourished in the West as
t
“logic” (WCT 21). Nor, even more fundamentally, is it the kind of 
T
thinking which Nietzsche called “blinking,” the formation of ideas
which “present and propose of everything only the glitter, only the
appearance of surfaces and foreground facets” (WCT 82).
T
Merely having thoughts, for Heidegger, is “idea forming,” 
and not at all what is involved in true thinking: “We understand, 
of course, and consider it the most obvious thing in the world, 
when someone says, ‘I think the matter is such and such,’ and 
with it has in mind, ‘I have such and such an idea of the matter’”
(WCT 45). But we have not yet really thought what is involved
T
in idea-forming. That is, we have thought of “idea forming”
as “thinking,” but we have not yet thought of idea-forming as
idea-forming, that is, as a distinct mode of thinking. Thus we
have not thought something which is determinative of our very
existence:

THEODORE
How do you distinguish something without defi ning it?
ERHARD
Yeah. We’re going to get to that. 
THEODORE
I got something about looking good. In being here I want this to be successful, and one of my 
fears is not looking good, going home and seeing that nothing happened.
ERHARD
You’re not free and that will keep something from happening. So when you’re willing to be with 
one of the possible outcomes–that nothing will happen–then you’re in a place where something
can happen to you. You see how strange that sounds? By being willing to have nothing happen
you are in a place where something can happen. Thanks.
(Theodore sits down)
Distinction is an operation in language. In the normal course of events, you and I think of 
language as something we use to report on something. Language is for talking
t
about. It’s for
abouting. Describing and explaining are operations in language called reporting. We think that 
there’s something out there that has a particular way it is, and I make a representation of it. And 
if my representation is accurate, I can make it work. But now we’re distinguishing a new kind 
of operation in language. It’s an operation in language called generating. It’s as though I said
“chair” and a chair came out of my mouth. Watch. You’re going to see this thing fall out of my 
mouth as I say it: I promise. When I said “promise,” what fell out of my mouth was a promise. 
When I say “I promise,” that’s a promise, isn’t it? What falls out of my mouth when I say “I 
promise”? A promise. When I say “I promise,” a promise falls out of my mouth. All I want you to 
see is there’s possibility in language that didn’t occur to you, because you hadn’t distinguished 
language as a generative act. So we’re sneaking up on the answer to the question: what is the
operation by which one distinguishes? Not an operation in language like reporting, but creating.
Listen up. Apes are not stupid. But no ape has ever picked up a stick along a path because he
needed to knock down bananas. Why not? Because apes live in a world with no possibility; be-
cause they live without language. And I don’t mean laboratory apes. Laboratory apes are tainted 
with language.
LOUISE
What about the hundredth monkey?
ERHARD
It’s totally false, that example. It’s bullshit, and demonstrated to be so. The author has acknowl-
edged that he wrote that to make a point. Lyall-Watson recanted that as scientifi c evidence. I
want to stop hearing that crap about the hundredth monkey.
That is, idea-forming shapes us, and thus “the essence of 
idea-forming is probably the first thing that must be put into 
the language of thinking” (WCT 55). This is the first step in the
T
appropriation of our current way of thinking: the recognition
and taking-over of that thinking, which is necessary before we 
can attain a possibility beyond it.
This aspect of Heidegger’s thinking has been central through-
out its evolution, emerging in various iterations, from the reso-
luteness of Dasein in Being and Time to the gentler releasement 
of his later work. It is also a central element in Werner Erhard’s
methodology. Both men posit the paradoxical idea that, rather 
than resisting those aspects of ourselves that we see as in some
way problematic, we let them be, and own them, and thereby gain
a freedom to think beyond them. The idea is fundamental to the 
transformation that both men are working to make available. ■
One might say, for instance: “I think it will 
snow tonight.” But he who speaks that way is
not thinking, he just has views on something.
We must be very careful, however, not to 
regard this “viewing” as insignificant. All our 
daily life and all we do moves within what we 
have in view, and necessarily so. (WCT 32)

Apes and dogs have language. So do rocks.
ERHARD
If everything’s got language there’s nothing to talk about, because nothing’s distinguished.
LOUISE
They are diff erent languages.
ERHARD
You’re making yourself stupid. You’re a fucking Californian. It’s that hundredth monkey shit. 
You denigrate the great mysteries when you turn them into crap. Apes don’t have language. It’s
true that apes signal. But they don’t communicate. Rocks bump into each other, and animals 
have a fancy form of bumping. But animals don’t have language, they have signals. Whatever it 
is we’re distinguishing with the word language, it’s what human beings do. Apes don’t dwell in 
possibility. To dwell in possibility you’ve got to have what I call language. I’m asserting some-
thing, and you can’t prove an assertion. You can disprove an assertion but you can’t prove it.
You can validate an assertion, and there’s a lot of evidence for that one. You can move without 
language. Rocks move all the time. One distinguishes by an operation in language in which pos-
sibility is generated. And it’s generated by speaking and listening, and by what’s present without
being said by virtue of what is said. Let me give you an example.

Julie, give me some water please? She doesn’t come up and throw a bucket of water on me.
(to the group)
Where the hell is “in a bucket” or “in a glass”? It’s not in your brain. It’s in the conversation. 
One of the possibilities in the domain of possibility called language is possibility itself. Two was 
distinguished in the conversation we had for distinguishing distinction.
(moving to the chalkboard and drawing a series of marks)
Is this two?
LOUISE
It’s two.
(grouping the marks with two enclosing outlines)
Now it occurs as two. Two is there if you’ve got the possibility “two.” There’s an infi nite number 
of ways to make that “two.”
LOUISE
But how do you do it?
ERHARD
It arises in language. Do you know how to ride a bicycle?

LOUISE
Yes.
ERHARD
How did you learn?
LOUISE
Just started to go and then discovered that my dad was not behind me.
ERHARD
That’s the story they say. But let me tell you how it happened. When you fi rst sit on a bicycle 
all the sensations are the same. They all feel the same: they’re all falling. At some point some 
sensations are falling and other sensations are not. They’re the same sensations you had when
you fi rst sat on the bicycle, but now some of them occur as falling and some as not falling. That 
happens when the distinction balance is distinguished as a possibility. Now your father told 
you, “you’ve got to balance. And balance is up like this.” That didn’t help. It all still felt like 
falling. When the distinction balance is distinguished—not conceptualized—then some of the 
sensations start to occur as balance, as not falling. 
(pausing

There are no twelve easy steps to distinguishing. If you’re willing to engage in the conversation
there’s a possibility of distinguishing there. Distinction arises in the conversation. You just can’t
see conversation. Very useful conversation. Thank you.
ANOTHER PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 3

When you said “I promise,” a promise falls out of your mouth; if I had listened to you promise 
twenty times and not keep your promise, then when you said the word “promise,” a promise
wouldn’t fall out of your mouth, just the word “promise” would.
ERHARD
Yeah. If you don’t keep your promise repeatedly, you create a no-possibility listening for promis-
ing, so that what falls out of your mouth is the word. So the possibility lives in the conversation. 
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 3

So the sacredness of a promise can only live in a conversation.

Yeah. And one of the things that fucks it up brutally is that bullshit about sincerity. Disgusting.

ANOTHER PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 4

In mapping this conversation onto an area of my life where I have a rich body of distinctions,
things like skiing or leading The Forum, or being with my kids. Looking at my kids’ develop-
ment. It seems like there are three things in the conversation for distinguishing distinction. I
wanted to see if I’m tracking with it. One is that it’s almost entirely in what is unsaid. What’s 
said is almost only because something needs to be said for there to be an unsaid.  The second is
that action is a necessary component.
ERHARD
Yeah, that would be misunderstood at this point. You can have an action in language too.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 4
(
)
The spoken conversation doesn’t necessarily need to be about what’s being distinguished.
ERHARD
That’s right. That’s what I read from Heidegger about leaving it the realm of the unsaid. Like in 
the Karate Kid.
ANOTHER PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 5
(
)
I had participation as a defi nition, and it shifted over to a distinction. I started to listen diff erent-
ly. When you talked about being used by a distinction, two things happened. I recalled a movie I
saw called The Gods Must Be Crazy. There was no Coke bottle for them, but I get that there was
no not-Coke bottle for me. I’m here for a breakthrough in my commitment in my relationship 
with my children and my wife. I’ve used up the context for my family.
 ERHARD
Listen up here. You create a possibility for your family and when you use up that possibility,
and wonder where the juice went: What’s missing may not be more and better content. What’s 
missing may be a new opening, a new possibility.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 5
(
)
And I could see that the conversation for extending the single dimension. There’s a new demand
for myself for generating distinction.
ERHARD
Something extraordinary opens up with a new realm of distinction. It’s not additive. It’s unrelat-
ed to what it was before. No persistence of the old.

So now this isn’t news—the power of distinction—see I had that as a defi nition distinct from
HEIDEGGER’S PEDAGOGY
Here, despite the aff inities we are proposing between the thinking 
of Heidegger and the work of Werner Erhard, we call attention to a 
fundamental diff erence in the nature of their work. This diff erence 
lies in the rhetorical form of their communication. In The Forum, the
model is not orator and audience, a commonplace view of rhetoric. 
Rather, The Forum’s form, elements of which have emerged in the 
various perspectives expressed in this book, is rhetorical dialogue, a 
strategic transaction which has as its aim the inclusion of the dialogic 
participants in the disclosive experience itself. Preservation, in this 
model, stands in a diff erent relationship to disclosure: it becomes the 
dwelling-within the work by those who have themselves participated 
in the disclosive and creative act of communication.

distinguishing distinction. And then I saw that there’s a particular relationship that I’ve adopted. 
I don’t see the incident, but I’ve got an already always listening, a new one I hadn’t seen before: 
“this is theirs, not mine.” I can see now that’s been using my life. There’s an opening.
ERHARD
When you can see “it’s theirs, not mine,” then there’s a possibility beyond “it’s theirs, not mine.” 
When you keep avoiding it, there is no possibility.
KYLE
What is the diff erence between diff erence and distinction?
ERHARD
Distinction is not dependent upon relationship, and diff erence is. Something that’s diff erent
is dependent upon that from which it is diff erent. I don’t see photons, I see people, although
what’s out there are photons. I don’t see with my eyes. I see with my mouth. That is to say, I 
see with language. Things occur as they occur because of language. What distinguishing is, is
to take something like an undiff erentiated mass and to bring forth from that mass a realm of 
possibility. Distinction gives existence. It makes existence possible. Distinctions aren’t depen-
dent on. They are kind of, of themselves. The eff ectiveness of someone who can deal from the
whole—and all that means is having the distinction—is very diff erent from someone who has 
all the parts.
(Kyle sits down)
Why we had this whole discussion: so we can distinguish racket—so your racket occurs for 
you as a racket. So that you’re not looking around for what fi ts the defi nition. I want it to show 
up for you as a presence. I’m going to distinguish a racket. A racket’s got to be something that
you’re protesting, saying you don’t want to be doing or being. Something you wish you weren’t
doing, or trying not to do it. Like let’s say you’re being stupid. It’s not a racket if you say listen, 
I’m being stupid on purpose, I get a lot out of being stupid. See when I’m stupid I don’t have to 
be responsible for anything. That’s not a racket. A racket is where you are like, “I wish I wasn’t
so stupid!” That’s when it’s a racket. A racket has got to be something you’re doing or being that 
you are protesting or resisting or that you don’t want to do or be. That’s what makes it a racket. 
And what’s driving it is the payoff . You’re getting something out of being stupid—that’s your 
racket. Like, “my family walks all over me, and I don’t want them to do that.” There’s a protest 
there. Then what’s the payoff ? I get to feel sorry for myself. “Oh I see: that’s a racket.” What’s 
driving you to be a way that your family walks all over you is the payoff  you get for having your 
family walk all over you. And then there’s a cost. There are three elements to a racket. You’re
doing or being something that you’re protesting or resisting, but you’re still doing it. It’s persist-
ing and you’re protesting the persistence. The second element is the payoff . It’s the payoff  which 
drives the racket. Rackets are not habits. Take the payoff  away, the racket disappears immediate-
ly. Being cranky is not a habit. Brushing your teeth is a habit. Pull all your teeth out, you’d brush
your teeth about three days. The payoff s are invariant and the costs are also always the same. 
Someone give me an example.
The scholar John Anderson has observed that throughout his
work, Martin Heidegger is “urging his hearers and readers toward 
a kind of transmutation of themselves. . .” (DT 12). Ronald Bruzina
locates this transmutation in a surrender to the direction of Heide-
gger’s thinking: 
Heidegger is not attempting to formulate a 
position, but rather to execute a movement. If 
we realize now that this “movement” he exe-
cutes is not only always in language, but also
in a highly original and strange kind of word-
ing, then we are close to seeing that this very 
immersion in a wording movement constitutes
thinking. (Ronald Bruzina, “Heidegger on the
Metaphor and Philosophy” 197)
“
Heidegger himself claimed that this direction of movement 
requires a transformation, which “occurs as a passage. . . in which 
one site is left  behind in favor of another. . . and that requires that
the sites be placed in discussion” (“DL” in OWL 42).
The critical element in this process was the passage. This point 
was made again at the beginning of the lecture series later published 
as On Time and Being, when Heidegger instructed his students on
the way of listening they should bring to the lectures in order that the 
intended transformation might be achieved: “Let me give a little hint 
on how to listen,” he said. “The point is not to listen to a series of prop-
ositions, but rather to follow the movement of showing” (OTB 2).
At the same time, Heidegger recognized the limitations of the 
lecture format for achieving the transformation he sought. In con-
cluding this same lecture series, he acknowledged that “the form of a 
lecture remains itself an obstacle. . . . The lecture has spoken merely in 
propositional statements” (OTB 24). Neither, he suggested elsewhere, 
is a “scientific dissertation” an appropriate medium for an inquiry into
language and Being, since “the movement of the questioning that is
called for here might too easily congeal” (“DL” in OWL 50, emphasis
added). Nor, he added, can “a transformation” be “established as the 
consequence of an accumulation of the results of philosophical re-
search” (“DL” in OWL 42). For Heidegger as for Erhard, transformation 
was a gestalt switch from one site of understanding to another, a leap.

MARY
I don’t want to follow the rules.
ERHARD
Are you up front about not wanting to follow the rules?
MARY
Yes.
ERHARD
Then it’s not a racket. So, let’s say we’re going to have a relationship. I’m going to be up front 
that I’m not going to follow the rules. Fine. No racket.
MARY
Are you saying it’s hidden?
ERHARD
It’s just not a racket if you’re up front about it. So if I say, hey Wes, I want to follow the rules in
the relationship, and I try to, but I just can’t do it. It’s not hidden, just something you’re protest-
ing. Something you’re resisting. If you’re doing what you want to do and saying that you don’t 
want to do it, and you’re doing it to get the payoff , that’s the racket.
ANOTHER PARTICIPANT
My racket is sitting still, not participating.
ERHARD
And he wants to stand up and participate, except he doesn’t, but he wants to. One more 
example.
ANOTHER PARTICIPANT
I say I am a partner with my husband, but I do things unilaterally.
ERHARD
Right, good. We’ll get into more examples, but fi rst I want to talk about the payoff s. If you’re 
unhappy about something in your life, unhappiness is invariably a racket because there’s some-
thing that you are that you don’t want to be. Nobody wants to be unhappy. What’s the payoff ? 
“Well there’s no payoff , it’s just terrible. I’m unhappy.” No, no. There’s a fucking payoff  in there. 
And the payoff  is...
(Kipp writing on the board: the three elements of a racket: Protest Payoff  Cost)
You’re protesting, but it persists... When you go home tonight and start to run your racket, 
I want it to be present for you like a racket, not like some fucking soap opera about “you’re
unhappy”; present for you more like “I’m that way because I’m getting something out of it. And
While Heidegger was committed to a transformation of 
his students’ thinking about Being, he did not engage them as 
individuals in a dialogue about the possibility of this transforma-
tion in their own lives—that is, in their own Being-in-the-world. 
Heidegger’s student Gadamer has commented in an interview with 
Ansgar Kemmann that Heidegger’s lectures, while astonishing in
their eff ects, were not explicit exchanges with his audience. In fact,
Gadamer has suggested that Heidegger’s relentless dedication to 
the communication of his ideas, in many ways so gripping, actually 
worked against his ability to engage the students in mutual con-
versation (“Heidegger as Rhetor” in HR 50).
An example of Heidegger’s pedagogical inquiry, consistent with 
Gadamer’s observation, is given in Medard Boss’s account of Heide-
gger’s 1958 seminars at the Psychiatric University Clinic in Zurich. 
Says Boss: “Only the participants of those first seminars are able 
to estimate what endless eff ort it cost until his medical listeners,
trained solely in natural science, began to even suspect what Heide-
gger was trying to say” (Heidegger and Psychology 10). The following
y
exchange is a fragment from the transcript of one of the seminars. 
Heidegger: What is distance?
Listener E: A definition of space.
Heidegger: What then is space as such?
(Ten long minutes of silence. . .)
 Listener F: We have never heard such questions
and do not know what you regard as important,
what you want to hear, what you want to say.
 Heidegger: I am only concerned that you open
your eyes and do not immediately dim and dis-
tort your vision once more with artificial sup-
positions or theoretical explanations. How is it,
then, with this matter that you have called an 
interval of space?
(Seven minutes of silence. . .).

I am uncomfortable with calling my unhappiness over my divorce a racket.
ERHARD
Yes, you’re fucking divorced.
ANGEL
It invalidates the fact that it hurts.
ERHARD
You’re fucking divorced.
ANGEL
It’s not a racket. It hurts.
ERHARD
You’re fucking divorced. It didn’t hurt. That is a fucking racket.
ANGEL
The word racket makes it sound like...
ERHARD
No I said fucking racket...
ANGEL
Fucking racket makes it sound like it’s not real.
ERHARD
It’s as real as any soap opera ever got.
We can assume that the students in Heidegger’s philosophy classes
would have been more responsive. Yet the transcript suggests 
that Heidegger, accustomed to the one-way communication form 
of the lecture, seems not to have been practiced in prompting
dialogue. ■

we not? Look, you’re so frightened of losing that racket it’s got you really upset. You’re going to
be a real wrong lady when we’re done with the conversation. You will have spent years in pain

Ahhh. Emerging racket. Listen. There is a payoff . Yeah, you got to justify what happened. That’s

Not insult. I’m insulting that crap.

SOLICITUDE OF A FORUM LEADER
In Heideggerian terms, the Forum leader’s way of Being-with-The-
Forum participants is characterized as extreme positive solicitude.
Solicitude is Heidegger’s term for Dasein’s way of Be-
ing-with-Others who are themselves Dasein—that is, other human
beings. This is distinct from how Heidegger understands concern,
which indicates our way of being toward Things, or present-at-
hand entities (please see the sidebar “Concern” in Session Four of 
Day One). Solicitude is an existentiale, which is to say, an aspect of 
Dasein’s Being. “Thus in concernful solicitude the Other is proxi-
mally disclosed” (BT 161).
T
Throughout Being and Time, Heidegger introduces charac-
teristics of Dasein as occurring in various ways or “modes,” which 
indicate that the characteristic generally shows up to a greater or 
lesser degree, or in some cases not at all. Describing this feature of 
Heidegger’s work, the book’s translators, John Macquarrie and Ed-
ward Robinson, comment: “It is as if zero and the negative integers 
were to be thought of as representing ‘deficient modes of being a 
positive integer’” (BT 42, note 1).
T
Heidegger tells us, for example, that solicitude, as a charac-
teristic of Being-with-one-another, maintains itself for the most 
part in the “deficient and Indiff erent modes.” “Being for, against, 
or without one another, passing one another by, not ‘mattering’ to 
one another—these are possible ways of solicitude” (BT 158).
T
Because of the prevalence of these deficient modes, Dasein,
sensing a need to create factical human connection, has devised

ANGEL
Having this as a racket isn’t my fault?
ERHARD
No, the question of fault is... it isn’t somebody else’s fault either. And it’s your responsibility. 
And as I’ve said, nobody knows what I’m talking about when I use the word responsibility, so
we’re not going to talk about that much anymore. Relax until we get back. You’ve been living 
with the pain for however many years it’s been, another... while people take a break... You know, 
peeing is very important to people... Peeing is more important to people than their lives. And
particularly more important than your life. If it was their life they might not have to pee, but 
because it’s your life, they have to pee. So we’ll continue this after the break.
Erhard left the room, and Kipp came onto the platform. He moved to the blackboard and expanded 
what Erhard had written about the structure of a racket:
right
g
dominates
justifi es itself
j
win
wrong   avoids domination        invalidates others      lose
KIPP
The payoff  expresses itself as: it always dominates, wins, or justifi es itself. Till you can get up
here on the board, I promise you nothing. The structure for the payoff , what keeps the payoff  in
place, is what’s up there on the board. The fi rst thing it costs you is your self-expression. Second,
the cost is any happiness in your life. You’re only happy to be right. The next cost is your vitality 
or your health. And the fi nal cost of having your life be lived by your racket is the possibility of 
love, of affi  nity.  You cannot put love, affi  nity, and being right together. If the cost gets bigger
than the payoff , you’ll give it up in a moment. That’s why in a tragedy you’ll be heroic: because 
the cost is right there in your face. Angel has been too generous. She has given you the whole
mechanism. If she couldn’t be right about the pain what would she have to confront in her life?
Erhard joined Kipp on the platform.
ERHARD
Angel, the pain makes the divorces right. You getting a divorce was wrong, and the pain makes 
it right. You’ve got the pain to make yourself right. That’s the payoff . What I’m asking you to see
is that the pain is not there because you got divorced. The pain is there to keep you from being
wrong about having been divorced. It works that way, doesn’t it?
ANGEL
Yes.
ERHARD
Never mind why it’s there. Forget that for the moment. Too hard to see that. If the pain weren’t 
there you’d be very wrong wouldn’t you? You’d be a shallow nobody whose promises didn’t 
ontic structures to correct the problem—empathy and “welfare 
work” are two that Heidegger mentions. But he also points out that 
these ontic solutions can never constitute or adequately replace 
Being-with, since they overlook the fundamental ontological issue:
the deficiencies in the dominant modes of Being-with.
But solicitude has a positive mode as well, which Heidegger 
calls extreme solicitude. This mode has two forms. On the one
hand, Dasein can leap in for the Other:
This kind of solicitude takes over for the Other 
that with which he is to concern himself. The
Other is thus thrown out of his own position. . 
. . In such solicitude the Other can become one
who is dominated and dependent, even if this
domination is a tacit one and remains hidden 
from him. This kind of solicitude, which leaps
in and takes away ‘care,’ is to a large extent
determinative for Being with one another. . . .
(BT 158)
“
In normal circumstances, a Forum participant might expect to 
receive that kind of sympathetic response to her circumstances, 
such as the marital issues being described by this participant. But 
Erhard’s solicitude in The Forum is of the second form:
[This is] a kind of solicitude which does not 
so much leap in for the Other as leap ahead of 
him . . . not in order to take away his ‘care’ but 
rather to give it back to him authentically as 
such for the first time. This kind of solicitude
pertains essentially to authentic care—that is, 
to the existence of the Other, not to a “what”
with which he is concerned; it helps the Other 
to become transparent to himself in his care 
and to become free for it. (BT 158–159)
“
We find in Heidegger’s distinction here of extreme solicitude as
leaping ahead of the Other a profound characterization of the role
r
of a Forum leader. ■

mean anything, wouldn’t you? Yeah. So you need the pain to keep you from being wrong. At
least it works that way doesn’t it?
(She nods)
Good, that’s all I want you to see for the moment. I want you to see how godawful important
it is to look good. Now we’ve gotten looking good a lot more sharply defi ned. Looking good is
constituted by being right. Or having something you identify with as right. And having other
people and other things be wrong. Angel would tell you that people who get divorced easily and 
don’t have any pain are wrong. I want you to see that it is so important that you’re willing to
suff er pain over a long period of time: intense pain over a long period of time that destroys your
happiness. Being right is so important, so sacred, that even a lot of pain over a long time is not
too much a price to pay to be right. I want you to see that this is not anything that would occur
to you normally. It would never ever in a million years occur to Angel that the pain made her
right, because that’s not the structure for interpretation in which we hold life. You and I have 
invented a new structure of interpretation for life: racket. Getting divorced does not produce
pain. Having your child die does not produce pain. Rackets produce pain. What happens never 
produces pain. If you lose a child and you’re sad, that heals the loss, and that’s not a racket. 
Authentic sadness heals the loss, then the loss diminishes, then the sadness, and fi nally it’s 
complete. But not in a racket: where life becomes about being sad. It’s very hard to see this, and
that’s why you need to distinguish this possibility powerfully so that what was a soap opera, a 
drama, which is very real and valid, can be seen for what it is, namely a racket. That isn’t going
to be easy for you to do, so you need to listen up with the distinguishing.
(indicating Angel)
You and I are not fi nished. After the break.

SPEAKING BEING
SESSION TWO INTERVAL
The Forgetting of Being, Part One of Eight: Getting and Losing 
In November 2013, while this book was in development, we delivered a presenta-
tion about it as members of a panel at the National Communication Association 
conference in Washington DC. Our thesis was that the ontological discourse of The 
Forum provides participants with direct access to an experience of Being. Following 
the presentation, an audience member asked this question: Aft er participants have
undergone the experience of Being that The Forum makes available, what becomes 
of that experience? Does it persist? 
This is obviously a central question for any consideration of Erhard’s work.
From its inception as the est Training, there has been a persistent quality of elusive-
t
ness, and therefore of mystery, 
y about the transformation this work makes available. 
People do not leave The Forum having gained the kind of cognitive understanding 
we generally expect from an educational process. The result, instead, is that by en-
gaging in the conversation that occurs in The Forum, participants have “gotten it,” in
somewhat the way that one gets a joke. Heidegger characterizes such a phenome-
non as undergoing an experience with language, which means that language “befalls
us, strikes us, comes over us, overwhelms us and transforms us” (“NL” in OWL 57).
The process is not linear; Erhard has described it as not getting it for a long
time, and then getting it all at once. But there is at the same time a recognition that
what you’re suddenly seeing is a truth you’d already always known at some level. 
Heidegger characterized it as “a leap” onto the ground on which we are already 
standing (WCT 233), and Erhard has characterized it in similar terms: “I can’t have it 
T
and give it to you. But I can communicate in a way so that you get an opportunity to 
realize that you have it yourself already. Essentially, this is what the est Training [and
t
later The Forum] was developed to do” (Bartley 169).
y
Heidegger’s German word for this kind of experience is Augenblick. The usual
translation is instant, moment, or split second; but Hubert Dreyfus says that in Heide-
gger’s use, the word is more appropriately rendered as moment of vision or transfor-
mation (BT, note 376; Dreyfus,
T
Being-in-the-World 321). In
d
Being and Time, Heidegger 
uses the word to designate the gestalt switch that occurs when a human being takes 
resolute ownership of his life and an authentic existence becomes possible (BT 387). 
T
Since the experience of The Forum is not understood in the usual way, neither 
is it retained in memory in the way that cognitive understanding is. Being can be
communicated, and the results reported by Forum participants give evidence that
its communication is experienced as transformative; but a quality of elusiveness
persists in the way that transformative experience is retained. Further, according to 
Erhard, the elusiveness is to be expected. “That’s the way it’s supposed to happen,”
he tells The Forum participants. “Getting and losing.”
 Why the elusiveness? What is it about Being that leads it to withdraw—as it
has withdrawn over two millennia from the human experience of existence; and as 
it withdraws repeatedly during The Forum dialogue as Erhard and the participants 
struggle to bring it to presence?
Heidegger has provided a response to this question in a series of lectures he
delivered at the University of Freiburg in 1935. Published in 1959 under the title An 
Introduction to Metaphysics, these lectures became his first book-length work to be 
translated into English. He later extended his thinking on the subject in four essays, 
published in 1975 as Early Greek Thinking. In these volumes, Heidegger locates the
source of Being’s withdrawal at the point of its first emergence. He calls this junc-
ture the beginning of history—the moment when the West’s first philosophers were 
beginning to think about the nature of Being, and to understand themselves as
world-creators.
 But in Heidegger’s account, Western thinking, at its very inception, failed to
capture the truth of Being in language. As a consequence, Being, and what its 
experience might make available, has been lost to us, and so thoroughly that even
its conceptualization defies our thinking. What does Heidegger see as possible 
if human access to Being was restored? He says that we would be opened to the
epiphany of a world (IM 69)—our everyday perceptions and experiences would occur 
newly, in a context of possibility that is not present in our current view of things. 
This context of possibility, he says, was available to humans in one brief 
moment of history. What became of Being? In this series on the forgetting of Being, 
during Intervals between sessions, we will present Heidegger’s account.

doesn’t happen. 
KIPP
What’s the truth?
JODIE
I’m not in a relationship.
KIPP
No. What’s authentic is “if I had a relationship, I’d be wrong. What gets me up in the morning is
how I can avoid being in a relationship.” And the racket is that you say what?
JODIE
That I want a relationship.
KIPP
Who do you get sucked into the racket? There’s a distinction called “on the court.” There’s
another distinction called “up in the stands talking about what’s on the court.” What your life is
about is not having a relationship. How do you feel about that?

JODIE
Cheated. 
KIPP
That was on the court. You could hear that. Who has to pay for your not having a relationship?
JODIE
Everyone in my life.
KIPP
If you’re not cheated, you don’t know who to be in life. Maybe there is no being authentic.
Maybe the best there is, is being authentic about your own inauthenticity. Being related is much 
more risky than being unrelated. You’ve got to be there in the presence of being human. 
JODIE
I got it.
KIPP
Don’t be so quick to get it. See, I don’t think you got it. I don’t think you got the dagger in your 
heart. What’s your racket an excuse for? You don’t have to reveal yourself. You don’t have to
create a relationship. What persistent condition do you complain about? A cheated person has 
to look like a cheated person. You can’t have love in your life or you’d be wrong. What today’s 
about is beginning to be in the presence of your own life.
JODIE
I want to get beyond this. 
KIPP
There is no getting beyond it. That’s more California. The opportunity is to be with it. Maybe
there is no getting beyond your racket. Maybe the only dignity is in owning it.
The participant, Mike, who earlier in the day had interacted with Erhard about “knowing how to
walk,” raised his hand.
MIKE
I don’t know what my racket is. I’m lost.

Look at your life. What is your life about? What is something that if you could do, you’d do it?
MIKE
I would have everybody like me.
KIPP
But...
MIKE
But if they get to know me, they stop listening to me after ninety seconds.
KIPP
When you are in the presence of another human being, what’s there?
MIKE
I look at the ceiling.
KIPP
Do you feel stupid?
MIKE
Yes.
KIPP
What happened when you were young?
MIKE
I tried to get in with a crowd of kids at school. I tried to blend in. A good friend of mine turned 
away and cut me out of the circle.
KIPP
Any others?
MIKE
When I was sweeping. Ten-years-old. My dad said I didn’t sweep well. I wasn’t smart enough to 
sweep.

KIPP 
“I’m not smart enough to sweep” never happened.
Erhard joined Kipp on the platform.
ERHARD
Mike, it’s something you became. Did “I’m not smart enough to sweep” ever happen?
The tone here was very quiet and still—the interaction was delicate, Mike somehow fragile.
MIKE
I don’t understand; I need more clarifi cation. I know that I missed places.
ERHARD
Did it happen that you missed places?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
Did it happen that your father pointed out where you missed?
MIKE
Yes. 
ERHARD
Did “I’m not smart enough to sweep” ever happen?
MIKE
I guess not. 
ERHARD
What do you mean, you guess? Guess is part of your racket about being stupid. I want you to get 
something: you became “I’m not even smart enough to sweep.” You didn’t just think it. You didn’t
”
just have that thought. You became “I’m not smart enough to sweep.” You made yourself into
“I’m not smart enough to sweep.”
Erhard sat on the edge of the platform facing Mike. The room was very still. Kipp sat nearby on the
platform edge.
MIKE
I became “I’m not smart enough to sweep.”

ERHARD
You made yourself into “I’m not smart enough to sweep.” It wasn’t true; It wasn’t false: Because
that’s not something that’s true or false. It’s just something you became.
MIKE
Okay. 
ERHARD
What’s the payoff  in becoming that?
MIKE
I didn’t have to try any harder, so I gave up.
ERHARD
One of the payoff s was, you avoided the responsibility of having to produce the result. You
avoided the domination of the responsibility for producing. Your brothers and sisters were dom-
inated by the need to produce. You avoided that domination.
MIKE
Correct.
ERHARD
Good. When did you fi rst have this conversation about being stupid?
MIKE
Eight or nine years old.
ERHARD
What happened that that became a conversation?
MIKE
Another time I was sweeping, I missed a spot.
ERHARD
And you became stupid at some point. You’ve got as much sense as anybody does. You started 
being stupid when you were eight or nine years old as a way of dealing with what was going on
with your dad. It’s a way of being you took on. What other payoff s are there?
MIKE
I didn’t have to fi ght my dad back in fi ghting that I was stupid.

ERHARD
You avoided the domination of your father by giving in.
MIKE
Right.
ERHARD
How much energy did your father put into fi xing you?
MIKE
He kept pointing out all the wrong things I did.
ERHARD
So you dominated your dad by getting him attached to your stupidity, right? Like Brer Rabbit. 
That was his relationship to you, trying to deal with your stupidity. 
MIKE
When he was trying to correct me.
ERHARD
What other payoff s did you get out of being stupid? Did you get to be right? Did your father get
to be wrong?
MIKE
I got to be right about being dumb.
ERHARD
Did you identify strongly with your father?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
So you made what you identifi ed with right.
MIKE
Correct.
ERHARD
What did it cost you to have a racket called being stupid?

I stopped talking with my dad.

A certain loss of love.
MIKE
Loss of my self.
ERHARD
You lost self-expression. You cut off  that avenue of self-expression called intelligence.
MIKE
Okay.
ERHARD
What about happiness?
MIKE
I was sad that I couldn’t make my dad happy.
ERHARD
Got it.
MIKE
I still don’t understand why the whole crowd was laughing at the beginning.
ERHARD
I don’t know. Why were they laughing at the beginning? 
KIPP
They laughed when he stood up and said he didn’t know what his racket was.
ERHARD
Mike, you’ve been in here for a little while right? People thought I was insulting when I called
them assholes. That was like a “damned with faint praise,” not an insult. Asshole is a fairly high
level. People are really stupid. Are you tuned in?

MIKE
Yeah.
ERHARD
I want to acknowledge you for not pulling one bit of shit during the two conversations you’ve 
had with me. You are an extraordinarily straight guy, who just had one racket: stupid, which 
you now know is a racket. My business is that when you run the racket you’ll know it’s a racket.
Anything else to complete for you?
MIKE
No.
ERHARD
Thanks.
(applause as Mike sits)
(to the group)
All you’ve got to do is get it straight: my racket is, the cost is, the payoff  is. That’s all you got to
get. Just that.
(looking around)
Where is Angel? Stand up and tell me what you’ve made of this so far.
Angel, who had earlier interacted with Erhard about her divorce, rose.
ERHARD
What’s your racket? My racket is...
ANGEL
I’ve had a long time to think about this so I’m supposed to know, right?
ERHARD
You’re not supposed to know anything. What do you know? My racket is...
ANGEL
That I’m a victim.
ERHARD
Very good. Yeah. You’ve got this big stupid soap opera, this stuff . The truth is you’re a racke-
teer. The truth is you’ve got this racket about being a victim. That’s the truth. Not all this soap
opera... That’s a smoke screen for being a racketeer. Your racket is that you’re a victim. Yes?

ERHARD
And what is the payoff  for being a victim? Take your time and look up there and say what the
payoff  is. 
(pausing as Angel stares at the chalkboard
(
)
Puzzling, isn’t it?
ANGEL
I don’t know what I get to be right about. I get to be right about what?
ERHARD
About being sincere.
ANGEL
And deeply emotional and caring. You forgot about that.
ERHARD
Yeah, you’re not deeply emotional and caring or sincere. You’re a fucking racketeer. And the 
racket is being a victim and the payoff  is that it makes you right. You’ve got this bullshit golden
calf called being deeply emotional and caring and being sincere. Being emotional and caring 
and sincere is bullshit. This is not holy or sacred. I didn’t say it wasn’t nice. So, you’ve got this
racket called being a victim and it makes you right because if you weren’t a victim and you 
weren’t suff ering, then you would be wrong, you would be invalidated, would you not?
ANGEL
Yes. 
ERHARD
You would be invalidated as a caring, deeply emotional, sincere person.
ANGEL
That’s why your telling me that I don’t hurt over my divorce invalidates and hurts.
ERHARD
I understand. I understand. All I’m doing is getting you, what I call “up on the pike,” so we can
work together on something. Did you want to say something?
ANGEL
I say that what I want to get out of The Forum is a marriage that would, like, last forever, but 
obviously what I’ve been about is making sure that I never can have that.

Forum Day Two: Session Three 147
ERHARD
But you don’t care about having a marriage that would last forever. All you care about is what 
validates you as a caring, sincere, deeply feeling person. 
ANGEL
That would do it.
ERHARD
Yeah exactly, but you see, you don’t care about being married. You really don’t care about being 
married. You don’t. If God came into the room and said, if you dyed your hair purple, that
would make it clear to everyone that you are a deeply caring, sincere, feeling person, hell, you’d 
be out there dyeing your hair purple. To hell with getting married. That’s your act. Your act is
that you’re sincere, deeply feeling, and a caring person. That’s an act with you. That’s not what
you are. Mike is not stupid. Mike has an act called “being stupid.”
ANGEL
So his father gave him his act.
ERHARD
No, no. He gave himself his act to deal with his father. Never mind that. Here’s what I want you 
to get: Mike is not stupid. Mike’s got an act called being stupid. You don’t care. You’ve got an act
called “I care” and you’re not deeply feeling. That’s an act. And you’re not sincere. That’s also an
act.
ANGEL
I believe he’s not stupid. 
ERHARD
And you don’t care. Now that’s not quite accurate. So listen up. It’s worse than that. I don’t
mean that you don’t care like “I don’t care.” I mean you are not caring. That’s an act. What you
call caring is a fucking act. Why are you afraid of not caring?
ANGEL
It would make me a bad person.
ERHARD
Who didn’t care?

It’s the opposite.

Okay. What happened there? We haven’t made the connection yet. Did you decide you had to be

ANGEL
Right. My mom told me I didn’t care.
ERHARD
I got it. And?
ANGEL
And that’s what happened. My mom told me I didn’t care.
ERHARD
How old were you?
ANGEL
I was fi ve.
ERHARD
Good. So what does a fi ve year old... Take your time. Let yourself be with that. So you were a
fi ve-year-old little girl, and your mother told you that you didn’t care. Yeah?
ANGEL
Yeah. My mother took in foster children. And I felt unloved because she was giving them her
love and attention. She told me I was not being caring because I should care and understand 
that they need it more than I do, and that I was being selfi sh.
ERHARD
Isn’t that a stupid fucking thing to tell a fi ve-year-old? Listen...
ANGEL
But she was helping somebody who really needed it, who didn’t have a mother or father, who...

Horseshit! What do you mean really needed it? That’s all horseshit. They’re probably 10 times as 
tough as you are. Probably needed a lot less than you did. But...irrelevant. You think a fi ve-year-
old is sophisticated enough to deal with that kind of logic?
ANGEL
I tried.
ERHARD
Is a fi ve-year-old sophisticated enough to deal with that kind of logic? You know what a fi ve-
year-old girl looks like?
ANGEL
Yeah, I do, I saw home movies over Christmas. I know exactly what I looked like. 
ERHARD
A fi ve-year-old girl is pretty...not very worldly, huh? And also very caring, aren’t they?
ANGEL
Yes. But she told me I didn’t care.
ERHARD
Wait. We’re not back at fi ve now. We’re having a discussion up here for a moment and then we’ll
go back to fi ve. But I want you to look at a fi ve-year-old little girl and see that a fi ve-year-old girl 
cares very deeply, and is not up to the logic “you don’t care” because if you’d care you would 
know that these other children need more love and attention than you do. So you dealt with it
like a fi ve-year-old. What does a fi ve-year-old decide?
ANGEL
She was right.
ERHARD (raising voice)e
No! She decides she’s going to be the most caring person in the whole world!
ANGEL
Yes! Yes! Yes!
ERHARD
Like those magical bullshit fucking things that fi ve-year-old girls do, which is wonderful when 
you’re a fi ve-year-old girl. You know, you decide, “I’m going to be the most caring person in the
whole world! No one’s going to care more than me.”

SPEAKING BEING
ANGEL
Right.
ERHARD
You became that like Mike became stupid. It wasn’t something you decided, it wasn’t something 
you thought. You became that.
ANGEL
You want to hear something stupid? Being stupid isn’t good but being sensitive and caring is 
good.
ERHARD
But listen up. You didn’t quite get what I said. You actually became, gave yourself an identity,
called caring. Whatever caring you had got buried under that identity. You became a caring ma-
chine. You became a caring robot. And whatever authentic caring you had, whatever authentic 
feeling you had; that got obscured by the robot. You get what I’m saying? You know what it’s 
like to be married to a robot? Not good. This is not a good thing. Being related to a fucking
robot. Particularly when the robot looks like they might be good for something else, like a real
relationship. Did you hear what I just said?
ANGEL
Yes.
ERHARD
That caring act will get you plenty of relatedness, but it will never fulfi ll itself.
ANGEL
Right. That’s why I could get married a million times, but I can’t stay.
ERHARD
Caring is very attractive. The only problem is it’s no fun to do it with a robot. And you’re a fuck-
ing robot. You know, like a doll. Like a caring doll. You push on the button that says “I care.” It’s
a lot of fun for a little while. But after a while it’s got to have some substance. You took a very 
good thing and turned it into a mechanism.
(referring to Mike)
You see, he at least took something bad and turned it into a mechanism.
(laughter)r
He had a little better luck than you did. You took something really good and turned it into a 
mechanism. So you know, his straightness, his authenticity leaks out around his act. But you 
took caring and being, like really being there, and turned it into an act, and it obscures your
authentic caring and authentic feeling.

So I’m inauthentic about caring.
ERHARD
Precisely. Now you have a great fucking act. It’s attractive, like bait.
Erhard sat on the edge of the platform, facing Angel. His tone was more forceful in this interaction
than it had been with Mike. Kipp again sat nearby.
ERHARD (continuing)
You attract people because you’re good at your act called caring. And you’re good at your act 
called deeply feeling. So you get the fi sh up.
ANGEL
I was so good I believed it.
ERHARD
Exactly. See, underneath there is some kind of caring. I don’t know what the hell it is. Maybe
you care, I don’t know. That doesn’t interest me. I’ll tell you one thing. You’ll never be happy 
being something you’re not, being your act. Ever. You’re never going to care enough, feel deeply 
enough, to be happy, because none of that is who you are. And I don’t know what you are. You 
may be caring. I don’t know. Neither do you. You only know what your act is. What there is to 
get is that it’s an act. You’ve done a very good job of that standing there. And I know it isn’t easy. 
You noticed how a lot of the stupidity for Mike started to go away near the end of that conver-
sation, interesting, right? Yeah. You want to relax for a little while; about this caring shit and 
about being deeply feeling. You might want to enjoy yourself for a little while, having some fun 
being shallow.
(laughter)r
See it doesn’t make any diff erence. This is a really important conversation because most of the
acts are going to look a little nasty. But a positive act is as detrimental as a negative one, in fact
it’s worse. She would have died like that. Shit. All the pain is pure bullshit, pure bullshit, noth-
ing authentic about the pain, not an iota of it. It’s all there to make you right. The pain’s not so
attractive anymore is it?
ANGEL
No.
ERHARD
What happened? You got divorced twice. Okay. That’s what happened, right? You got married. 
Then you got divorced. You got married. Then you got
divorced. That’s all that happened. Not, “and I didn’t keep my vows, and nah nah nah nah.”

Right.
ERHARD
When my dog walks up to you, and all he can tell is you smell good. That’s the whole story 
about you for my dog. You’re starting to get how brutally stupid it’s been to waste your life feel-
ing badly about those stupid divorces. You know, you made a mistake. You know, I had seven
children. I never punished my children. I never decided on their punishment. In fact we never 
talked about punishment. In life you do whatever you want, I’ve got certain rules. The rules are
not for you; they are for me. Don’t walk out in the street and get run over, I don’t want to see
you bloody. When you grow up you can do anything you want. When you’re around me don’t
get run over, I don’t want to see you bloody. You get run over there’s a consequence. When my 
kids did something I would say, “You did it, good, now what’s the consequence?” “I shouldn’t 
be allowed to eat for a week.”
(laughter)r
“Okay,” I would say, “I understand what you said, but we’re going to be a bit more lenient than 
that.” Kids are nuts about punishing themselves. And you had a fi ve-year-old running her mar-
riage. You had to be the most caring person in the whole world. So when the marriage didn’t
work, like when I asked my kids what should happen to you because you did this, I should not 
eat for a week. You had to make this enormous punishment for yourself.
ANGEL
Like I should not be happy for the rest of my life.
ERHARD
Precisely. Very good. I don’t want to see you cry any more about that. I want you to see how 
stupid that is, how patently, brutally stupid. How old are you?
ANGEL
Thirty-two.
ERHARD
How old were you when you fi rst got married?

Yeah. The suff ering and unhappiness was in the marriage.
ERHARD
But you put up with it.

And that was good because somebody who cares more than anybody else in the world will put
up with a lot of shit. So it made you right to suff er in your marriage. Made you a good person.

People who step on them.
ERHARD
Exactly. You got it. And you know what? A doormat keeps a person who wants to wipe his

dominated him by being the victim. Now, he had his racket as well—two racketeers rubbing up

Watch that word “created”; that gets bandied around by people who have done this work, and
they don’t know what they’re talking about. What happened was: you got divorced. And that
left you deeply unhappy.
ANGEL
The same place I was when I was married before.
ERHARD
Yeah. So you’ve got to get to the point where a fart and having been divorced are on equal levels.

There’s something very wrong about that. I don’t know what it is...

Is that really possible?
ERHARD
Yeah it is really possible. They’re both just a “what happened.”

ERHARD (playing an imaginary violin)
n
Yeah, your zhuuuuuu.
(laughter)r
Okay. Your racket is being a victim. And your racket is being righteous.
ANGEL
And being caring.
ERHARD
Right. And it makes you right and the rest of the world wrong. It allows you to dominate and 
allows you to avoid domination of a gutsy being-related-to-somebody.
ANGEL
Yes.
ERHARD
Don’t forget that part. That’s an important part of the payoff . And you got to justify yourself. You 
see, “after all I was a good girl.” And what it cost you is, well, my guess is you pay for everything 
up there.
(referring to the chalkboard)
You’re so young, maybe you haven’t paid with any of your health, I don’t know, maybe vitality. 
Clearly it cost you happiness and love.
ANGEL
Because I thought that was the act of loving someone.
ERHARD
And it is the act, but in that wrong sense. And my guess is that it has cost you some self-expres-
sion. See I don’t know who you are.

I don’t either.

SPEAKING BEING
fi nd out every time you’re on it. And for you, on it is caring. And feeling deeply. I’ve been doing 
this work long enough that I can see behind people’s masks a little bit, and you’re a very beau-
tiful person, but not in the way you think. Not in some airy fairy bullshit sense. But in a really 
gutsy sense. Who knows. I can be full of shit too.
(to the group)
There’s no fi nish to this... There’s no “And then she stopped being that!” She’ll be that act for-
ever. And when she’s being that she’ll have a possibility beyond being that. When she’s running
that act there will be no possibility beyond running that act. You got to own being a fake. You’ve
got to be authentic about being inauthentic. Good for you. There ought to be some lightness in
that for you. 
ANGEL
It’s incredible. I can’t even describe how it feels to be able to say that I faked caring.
ERHARD
Yeah. 
(long, loud applause)
(to the group)
The important part for you is to get how implausible this is, that being able to be that you’re 
a fake gives you power. That’s totally implausible. It’s what you’re afraid to be that keeps you 
from being. And the worst thing in the whole universe, the worst thing for the last twenty 
seven years of Angel’s life would be to be a fake. There couldn’t be anything worse than that. 
The nastiest thing she could be. And avoiding being that cost her her life. That’s implausi-
ble, that doesn’t make any sense, and if I told you that yesterday you wouldn’t have gotten it. 
You could not have gotten what Angel just did with herself, yesterday. You’re now living in a 
diff erent structure of interpretation. You’re dwelling in a diff erent conversation. So you can 
tolerate counter commonsensical phenomena: what doesn’t make sense normally—like being 
able to be “I don’t care” for a person for whom that is the worst thing you could be—would be 
a source of power.
(to Angel)
Anything else?
ANGEL
No, thank you.
ERHARD (to another participant)
Yes?
SOCIAL MOODS
As we pointed out in our discussion of moods in Day One, Heide-
gger says that moods are not individual “psychical” phenomena,
but rather aspects of the way the world is disclosed to Dasein. 
He also says that moods can be public:
Publicness, as the kind of Being which belongs
to the “they,” not only has in general its own
way of having a mood, but needs moods and
‘makes’ them for itself. It is into such a mood 
and out of such a mood that the orator speaks. 
He must understand the possibilities of such
moods in order to rouse them and guide them
aright. (BT 178)
“
In our analysis of The Forum, we are not characterizing Erhard
(or any other Forum leader) as an orator, but as a rhetor, which is
to say simply a person who uses language to some end. Rhetoric 
does not have the same formal implications as oratory, and the di-
alogic ontological rhetoric of The Forum is a significantly diff erent 
mode of communication from the monologic public speaking of an 
orator. 
And yet Erhard, in a debriefing with The Forum leaders during
the 1989 Forum, stated that one of the results he had to achieve in 
leading The Forum was to “produce some eff ects.” We also know 
from our experience that Forum leaders are acutely sensitive to
the mood in The Forum room.
Hubert Dreyfus, in his study of Being and Time, asserts that
in addition to being public, moods can be social, and he quotes
this passage on social moods from a lecture Heidegger delivered 
in 1929:

Forum Day Two: Session Three

PARTICIPANT
Can you have more than one act?
ERHARD
Yes. I don’t say you won’t do your old number again. I just say you’re left with a possibility 
beyond your old number. Being related is enormously risky. I don’t care what fairy-tale bullshit
you bought into. You’re going to get hurt being related.
(to the group)
There are no answers to being successfully related. And you, assholes, have been looking for the
answer to being successfully related. That’s why you’re assholes. There’s a way to be empowered 
and enabled in the face of the risk that being related is. You can bring power and ability to the
risk. You can’t bring answers. There are no formulae, no ten easy steps. Okay. We need to do this 
about three times.
Kipp now took the lead in the interactions with participants, but Erhard remained in the conversa-
tion, wandering around at the back of the room and sometimes taking over an interaction that Kipp 
had begun. 
ERHARD
See, you’re so thrown to the story that you tell the story about the racket, and that will nev-
er give you anything beyond your racket. That’s what the structure of the distinction racket 
is for, to break up the story. You die without knowing who you are if you live your life for
approval.
(regarding one participant’s persistent back pain)
You think people are really built that badly?
PARTICIPANT
My racket is I’m scared of doing it wrong. That doesn’t sound right.
ERHARD
That’s a very frequent payoff—avoid the domination of being responsible for. That’s a very 
childish concern, but that’s where your racket comes from. Kids’ rackets are avoiding the 
domination of being responsible. You are going to be a little boy or little girl until you com-
plete your relationship with your parents. You are not going to grow up until you complete 
your relationship with your parents. You are not going to get away with it. I happen to have 
had a mother who never made a mistake... only one. I’ll tell you what that was later. This
is one that I know about deeply and profoundly. You are not ever going to make it until
your parents make it with you. No kidding. You just got to get off it with your parents. I’ve 
spent most of my life engaged in this question about what it is to be human. What is it that 
Moods are not accompanying phenomena;
rather, they are the sort of thing that deter-
mine Being-with-one-another in advance. It
seems as if, so to speak, a mood is in each case
already there, like an atmosphere, in which 
we are steeped and by which we are thor-
oughly determined. It not only seems as if this 
were so, it is so; and in light of these facts, it is 
necessary to dispense with the psychology of 
feelings and experiences and consciousness. 
(Being in the World 171)
“
Observes Dreyfus: “Heidegger would no doubt appreciate the fact 
that we ordinarily say we are in a mood, not that a mood is an
experience in us.”
Having participated in, and observed, a number of Forums, we 
know from personal experience that the process can be seen as a 
roller-coaster of mood shift s. Erhard tells the participants on the
first day that they should bring their current moods into The Fo-
rum with them, and not try to fix them; so the moods of the partici-
pants are of course at some level individual, though not subjective, 
with each participant Being-in-his-or-her-own-world.
But in conjunction with our analysis of Being-with (in the
sidebar with that title in Session One of Day Two), and in light of 
our own experience of The Forum, we raise this point about the
nature of social moods. We do so to contrast such moods with the
collective sense of aff inity that inevitably accompanies The Forum
transformation. 
Heidegger’s distinction of the publicness of the they-self is 
presented as an aspect of Dasein’s fleeing its authentic self. Public-
ness, in that context, characterizes the levelling-down of Dasein’s
possibilities to the average, in the service of its flight from authen-
ticity. We assert that the general mood in The Forum, through its
roller-coaster changes to its ebullient finish, is an aspect of what 
it means for the authentic self to appropriate its own inauthentic-
ity, and it diverges greatly from the levelling down the publicness

makes you and me the way we are? The standard interpretation as to how you and I got to
be the way we are has no power. It gives me nothing to say about it. I can’t talk myself into
being. A lot of the lack of freedom is constituted in your relationship with your parents.
The single most important learning experience in my life was doing programs with teenag-
ers. The ten-day course for teenagers we used to do in the mountains—let me tell you what 
I found out about teenagers. After ten days, you find out that the single most important
thing in your life is that you love your mother and father. And that’s no shit. And there’s
very little structure in a teenager’s life to express that. You’ve got to get that resolved, and if 
you’re smart you’ll get it resolved tonight. We’ll let you out of here early enough to call your
mother, call your father.
(forcefully
(
)
You just gotta get off  it. You’re wasting your time and money in here if you’re going to stay on it 
with your parents. 
(in response to a question about what it means to be complete)
What I meant by being complete... your parents have got to be all right with you exactly the way 
they are. Your parents don’t owe you a thing. They don’t owe you their love. You are not entitled
to your parents’ love. You owe them. I know, it’s a bitch. I don’t like it either. I don’t like gravity.
I don’t like being tied down. Gravity doesn’t care. It’s the way it is. Until you are complete with 
your parents you can’t be yourself. Just loving them isn’t enough. You’ve got to be able to fully 
be with your parents the way they are. You know, I spent most of my life tied to my mother’s 
apron strings. And she had very long apron strings. I deserted my family. They didn’t know 
where I was. Gone for years. I was still my mother’s little boy. I didn’t grow up till I was thirty 
something.
Here Erhard acknowledged a nineteen-year-old participant who had shared about his relationship
with his parents for being complete with them at an early age.
ERHARD (continuing)
I don’t know if you can see it or not, but until that happens you aren’t anything but your moth-
er’s little boy.
Erhard left the room at this point, and Wes took the platform.
WES
We’re now in the bonus category. This goes beyond The Forum. Look at your relationship with
your parents from the question: “Are they really all right with me?” What do you have to get off  
with them? Being complete never leaves anybody with something dumped on them. Use the din-
ner break to complete with your parents.  Find a telephone. Reach them. If your parents are not 
alive, fi nd someone with whom you are incomplete and complete with them. Is anybody unclear?
As Erhard returned to the room, Jane, a teenage participant, rose and spoke, her manner very shy 
and serious.
of the they-self governs. As participants share and disclose their 
stories, as they own up to and appropriate the ways they wound 
up being (owning their “thrownness”—see the next sidebar), and
further, as they grasp and admit the harm that justifying these
ways of being has wrought: the “social mood” of profound aff inity 
gets evoked. ■

I don’t understand about being complete with your parents.
WES
Are your parents all right with you the way they are?
JANE
Yeah.
WES

Jane, there’s something going on with you about your parents, isn’t there?  
JANE (very tentative)
I don’t know. 
ERHARD

Yeah.

Yeah.
ERHARD
What is it?
JANE
The only thing I can think of is my stepmom, the way they brought her into my life.
THROWNNESS
Thrownness is a central Heideggerian term that Werner Erhard uses
extensively in responding to the first question of The Forum: What
is the Being of human beings? 
In Being and Time, thrownness is a fundamental aspect of 
Dasein’s existence; Erhard calls it “the default clearing” for human 
beings (Author notes, Intro to 6-Day LA 1989). “In thrownness,” 
says Heidegger “it is revealed that in each case Dasein, as my 
Dasein and this Dasein, is already in a definite world and alongside 
a definite range of definite entities within-the-world” (BT 264
T
). 
Thrownness determines Dasein’s options in life, and there are no
others: “As something thrown, Dasein has been thrown into exis-
tence. It exists as an entity which has to be as it is and as it can be”
(BT 321
T
), and further, “it has been brought into its ‘there,’ but not
of its own accord” (BT 329
T
).
The word “thrownness” expresses the way we wound up
being, the way we find ourselves to always already be: thrownness
determines what we automatically are, and it limits our future 
possibilities (what we “can be”). It is the ontological clearing which
Being has sent in our time. “We’ve got only the possibility which 
we inherited,” says Erhard, “the possibility into which we were
thrown—we’re thrown to be this particular way, we’re thrown into 
this kind of being that has this particular set of options” (“The
Heart of the Matter”).
Heidegger says that these options are not objective brute facts 
about the environment into which we are thrown; that would be the 
factuality of the situation, and we might discover those facts if we
y
looked for them. But Dasein’s thrownness “is meant to suggest the 
facticity of its being delivered-over” (BT 174). We live in the facticity, the
T
way we
y
wound up being, and not the factuality; we don’t see the raw 
data of the environment, we see a story about the world. This is our 
y
facticity: that we are thrown, and that our thrownness is not deter-
mined by the things or circumstances “out there.” Rather it is char-
acteristic of Dasein’s way of Being-in-the-world. Dasein has wound
up whatever way it wound up being, and to perpetuate itself, Dasein 
must avoid owning up to what it costs to self-justify this thrown way
of being. From the point of view of the way we 
y
wound up being, then,

ERHARD
So let’s talk about that a bit. What happened?
JANE
My dad came home with her. He was gone for a while, and he said “this is your mom.” That’s it. 
No questions.
ERHARD
And what did you say to yourself?
JANE
Fine.
ERHARD
Did you? Did you stuff  it?
JANE
Well I thought that maybe he brought her in so that I would have a mom, ’cause my parents got
a divorce, and then two months later my real mom died. And I feel like he brought her into my 
life.
ERHARD
Is what you’re feeling badly about...
JANE
But my mom loves me. I’m glad for half the things she does. But at the time I thought, “she’s 
such a bitch, why is she doing this?” And I wanted to just run away. Now I realize she loved me, 
and that she wasn’t trying to replace my real mom.
ERHARD
Good. It doesn’t mean that your mother is not weird. Because we’re all weird, right, you’ve seen
that in here. But your mother loves you, and she’s weird. With your mother, it’s got to be that 
she’s all right just like she is. I didn’t say she was right to be the way she is. My mother didn’t do 
the stupid things she did with me because she loved me. She did the stupid things she did with
me because she was stupid. And she loved me. It’s not that she was right. So you’ve got a little
bit of a ploy in there about making your mother right for the way she is, you all. So, any better 
sense of what that sadness is? Does it have to do with your mother and father’s divorce?
JANE
I don’t remember that.
ERHARD
Does it have to do with your mother dying?
ontological inquiry—the kind of speaking that evokes Being—occurs 
as something to turn away from, to try to leap over. 
Indeed, Heidegger is emphatic about the centrality of our 
facticity in determining our existence. Our mood, our state-of-
mind, the way we understand our world—from the phenomeno-
logical perspective—those are the facts: “[M]ood brings Dasein 
before the ‘that-it-is’ of its ‘there,’ which, as such, stares it in 
the face with the inexorability of an enigma.” Even if Dasein 
strives for “rational enlightenment,” tries for a detached stand-
point, and tells himself that, really, it’s just a mood—“all this
counts for nothing as against the phenomenal facts of the case”
(BT 175
T
).
Hubert Dreyfus, in his reading of Being and Time, chooses to
translate Heidegger’s Befindlichkeit as aff ectedness rather than state-
t
of-mind. The latter phrase, he feels, suggests a private subjective 
mental state, when what Heidegger is distinguishing is Dasein’s 
“being found in a situation where things and options already matter” 
(Being In The World 168). This is an important point. In our thrown-
d
ness, things are encountered as already and always meaningful:
Letting something be encountered is primarily
circumspective; it is not just sensing some-
thing, or staring at it. It implies circumspec-
tive concern, and has the character of becom-
ing aff ected in some way. . . . Being-in as such 
has been determined existentially beforehand
in such a manner that what it encounters
within-the-world can “matter” to it in this
way. (BT 176)
“
Heidegger’s point is that our moods, like our states of mind, are 
not the subjective individual phenomena found in a Cartesian 
model of human being. For Heidegger, a mood “comes neither 
from the ‘outside’ or ‘inside,’ but arises out of Being-in-the-world, 
as a way of such Being” (BT 176
T
). 
Our thrown way of being is not one that we could make
explicit or theorize. It is not based upon beliefs, and human

No.

You notice the almost stupid “not”? She didn’t have to be stupid there. Not “I guess.” And that’s
from the beginning because she just showed up and you didn’t have a chance to build a relation-
ship. Like here’s your mother. Have you built a relationship since then?
JANE
Yeah.
beings do not, for the most part, subject our everyday actions 
to analysis. We simply engage in the practices of our inherited
traditions, the tradition into which we have been thrown. But
our understanding of ourselves remains superficial: “Ontical-
ly, of course, Dasein is not only close to us—even that which
is closest. We are it, each of us, we ourselves. In spite of this,
or rather for just this reason, it is ontologically that which is 
farthest” (BT 36
T
).
Dreyfus has proposed examples of the way we inherit 
elements of this thrownness. A Japanese mother comforts her 
baby in the manner of her culture, in quiet and soothing ways, 
while her American counterpart stimulates her baby into more
active and vocal behaviors. These parenting choices are, in large 
part, unconscious on the part of the mothers; they are simply
reproducing their cultures’ ways of being. Nevertheless, by
the time the infants are three to four months of age, they have 
already learned to be Japanese and American infants (Being In 
The World 17). In another example, Dreyfus proposes that all of 
d
the implicit but important rules governing nonverbal behaviors, 
which differ widely among cultures—such aspects of proxemics
as the appropriate distance to stand from others, the relative
desirability of direct eye contact, or the situational expectations 
regarding touch—are learned by unconscious observation as we 
mature within a culture (Being in the World 18). These rules be-
come inculcated long before we might explicitly reflect on them,
and by then, Dasein’s everyday existence is already determined
factically, along with the social moods that shape our options 
for being with others in the world.
It is important here to note that thrownness, like other 
ideas introduced by Heidegger to distinguish Dasein’s existence,
should not be interpreted as a negative state of Being. Given its
apparent limitations, this is counterintuitive, and challenging for 
us to think. But such paradoxical languaging is crucial to under-
standing the thinking of both Heidegger and Erhard. Negative
conditions naturally lead to the human impulse...to “fix” them, 
but both Heidegger and Werner Erhard propose a more unortho-
dox response. ■

Okay that’s what happened and that’s what you’re sad about. You had a bond with your father,

JANE
That I had to break the bond between them, her and me? Tell her how I feel. And tell her how I 
felt that she came.
ERHARD
That’s not a strange way for a little girl to feel, now is it? 
JANE
No.
ERHARD
But for a mature woman, that’s clearly not what happened, is it?
JANE
I don’t understand.

Looking from your point of view now, did your father’s marriage break the bond between you
and your dad?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
Can you get off  it with your stepmom about breaking the bond between you and your dad?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
So maybe you could say to your stepmom that when I was a little girl, I didn’t even realize it un-
til I saw it today, but there’s been something in the relationship between you and I. “When I was
a little girl and you came into my life, it felt like you had broken my bond with my father, but 
now I see that that isn’t true. So that’s not between you and me any more. I can be fully related
to you.” How does that feel?

FORUM DAY TWO: SESSION FOUR
The Forum resumed at 9:10 pm, following the dinner break. Kipp was on the
platform with Erhard, and asked for questions in response to the break assignment
to have a conversation about the seminar program. After Kipp fi elded these ques-
tions, Erhard came forward.
ERHARD
I know it’s possible to turn this into another thing you’ve done in your life.
In independent surveys, most people say it was the most, or a very, signifi -
cant experience in their life. The way you determine what’s possible is by the
conversation that you are. This was not designed as another seminar. This was 
not designed to help you get better. This was not designed to improve you. We
could have done that with a lot less time and eff ort. You want to be here for 
something extraordinary. You want to be here for the possibility that this could 
make the diff erence in your life. This was designed to make the diff erence in 
your life. Now with regard to this seminar business: See, I don’t like this con-
versation. What is so strange about doing something about who you are reg-
ularly? I go to the dentist regularly, do something for my teeth regularly. This
is extraordinary stuff . If what happened in this room before the break didn’t
move you, didn’t touch you... if that didn’t turn you on, this is not a great thing 
for you to do. But if this speaks to you, this is a very appropriate place for you. 
So we’re going to talk to you about the seminar program. You have the power
to decline. This is a very easy conversation to pay attention to if you’re clear 
about the fact that you’ve got the power to decline.
During this conversation Erhard came down from the platform and moved around
among the group.
(continuing)
How many of you have had some major impact in your life out of the two days
so far?
A majority of the participants stood. 
(continuing)
This is a part of The Forum. You know that form you fi lled out this morning?
That’s a part of The Forum.

He’s not like you. He’s not hanging out. Kipp is up to something. It looks 
like we’re doing one Forum. We’re really doing fi ve hundred diff erent Fo-
rums because each person brings something diff erent to it. You don’t know 
what you are. You only know what you were. If you give yourself a future
based on what you were, that’s not very powerful, is it?  We want to give you
the power to create a future not given to you by the past.
PARTICIPANT
Isn’t that artifi cial?
ERHARD
Yes, in a certain sense it’s artifi cial, in that you can’t predict it. But in a certain 
sense isn’t everything that’s created artifi cial? I have a little rule in my relation-
ships. Don’t ever do anything you don’t want to do. I’ve got another rule: ride 
the horse in the direction it’s going. They’re the same rule.

Because nobody ever does anything they don’t want to do... “I don’t want to be

At this point Wes moved forward on the platform. Erhard remained in the room, 
strolling around in the aisles.
WES
We’re going to take a deeper look at the distinction racket. You have to be lis-
tening from the question, what is the distinction racket and what is my racket? 
Try on the possibility that your racket is both something put out there and
something covering up.
ERHARD
You don’t need to see what happened... Here’s all that’s important: my racket
is, the payoff  is, the cost is. Wes is going through the other stuff  with people
so you can see more of the racket that underlies that. But you don’t gotta get
what happened in order to gain some freedom from your racket.

Lots of people are trying to get better. And it’s a racket. If you’re trying to get
better, it’s all right if you don’t produce results. There are certain relationships 
between payoff s and costs. Avoiding responsibility and stifl ed self-expression
are almost invariably related.
WES
Selfi sh lives in your mouth. Or, more rigorously, in your conversation... Selfi sh

fact, people will give up their whole lives to be right. How many people on the
dinner break called and reached someone in your life and got complete?
About one hundred people raised their hands.
As the second day of The Forum neared its end, assistants distributed homework
assignments to the participants.

Here’s your assignment for this evening. First, consider inquiring into what’s

for its own why. The question “Why the Why?” looks externally 
and at first like a frivolous repetition of the same interroga-
tive, which can go on forever; it looks like an eccentric and
empty rumination about insubstantial meanings of words.
Certainly that is how it looks. The only question is whether we
are willing to fall victim to this cheap look of things and thus 
take the whole matter as settled or whether we are capable 
of experiencing a provocative happening in this recoil of the 
why-question back upon itself. (IM 6)

The Forgetting of Being, Part Two of Eight:  Questioning
The Forum is an inquiry. It is a process of asking questions, not providing informa-
tion. The value of the process arises in the questioning itself. This is questioning of a 
radically diff erent nature than we are accustomed to. “To pronounce the interroga-
tive sentence, even in a questioning tone, is not yet to question,” says Heidegger; he 
continues:
“
If I say to you “Why are there beings at all instead of nothing?”
then the intent of my asking and saying is not to communicate 
to you that a process of questioning is now going on inside me. 
Certainly the spoken interrogative sentence can also be taken
this way, but then one is precisely not hearing the question-
ing. The questioning does not result in any shared question-
ing and self-questioning. It awakens nothing in the way of a
questioning attitude, or even a questioning disposition. For 
this consists in a willing to know. . . . Questioning is willing-to-
know. (IM 23)
M
In this passage Heidegger distinguishes a questioning state of mind, a standing-
in-the-question that at the same time wills itself forward into the opening of the 
question—a dialogic engagement in the questioning process, a listening which par-
ticipates in the questioning advance along with the questioner. This possibility of the
listener’s thinking-Being along with the questioner will be seen to be an important
element of The Forum.
Despite the fact that the question of Being never elicits an answer, the question-
ing itself—“a distinctive occurrence that we call a happening” (IM 6)—is a transforma-
tive experience. This is because “the question of Being must be asked of Being about
Being from within Being” (BT 24), and therefore is in its essence reflexive:
T
“
 The why-question challenges beings as a whole, so to speak, 
outstrips them, though never completely. But this is precisely 
how the question gains its distinction. What is asked in the 
question rebounds upon the questioning itself, for the ques-
tioning challenges beings as a whole, but does not aft er all 
wrest itself free from them. . . . It runs up against the search 
A body of scholarship has noted the aff inities between the thinking of Heidegger 
and that of Zen (e.g., Steff ney (1977), Kotoh (1987) and Storey (2012)). Heidegger’s 
attention here to the possibilities of an apparently tautological question recalls the 
use in Rinzai Zen of seemingly nonsensical koans (What is the sound of the one hand
clapping?) to eff ect a transformation in thinking.
But the locus of the transformation is not the thinking of the questioners; nor 
are the circumstances themselves altered. Rather, in the questioning itself, every 
secure foothold is lost (IM 32). In that moment, the possibility of new understand-
ings emerges. 
This power of the question of Being to undermine foundations is central to the 
process of The Forum. Erhard’s ontological inquiry is constructed upon two funda-
mental questions: What is the Being of human beings? and What is the possibility of 
Being for human beings? The first question undermines the foundation; the second
?
moves toward the creation of new understandings. Both are essential and distinct 
elements of the same questioning movement. It is this modulation of questionable-
ness into possibility that Heidegger addresses here:
“
 Our questioning just opens up the domain so that beings
can break open in such questionworthiness. . . . Yet, it is this
questioning that pushes us into the open, provided that it it-
self, as a questioning, transforms itself (as does every genuine
questioning), and casts a new space over and through every-
thing. (IM 33)
M
The situation is not changed through questioning; its possibility is transformed.
But questioning, according to translator J. Glenn Gray, was not for Heidegger a
codified procedure:

“
 Putting in question is not primarily a method for him as it was 
for Descartes and for his teacher Husserl. At least it is not a
method in the sense that one uses it as a preliminary to build-
ing up a body of doctrine aft er tearing down earlier systems.
No, for Heidegger questioning is a way or path of thinking 
which each one must clear for himself with no certain desti-
nation in mind. (WCT xiii)
T
The seeking of answers is so basic to the scholarly calling that conceiving such a 
questioning attitude is problematic, and maintaining that attitude more so:
“ 
 Being able to question means being able to wait, even for a 
lifetime. But an age for which the actual is only whatever goes 
fast and can be grasped with both hands takes questioning as 
a “stranger to reality,” as something that does not count as 
profitable. But what is essential is not counting but the right 
time—that is, the right moment and the right endurance.

SPEAKING 
BEING
DAY THREE
Day three of The Forum began at 9:00 am, with The Forum leader, Kipp, on the platform asking 
participants to share about the assignment from the previous evening: to share their experience of 
The Forum with someone in their lives.
KIPP
When you talk about what happened, people are left, and you’re left, with whatever description 
gives you. We’re going to call that domain of speaking “up in the stands.” Does talking to the 
person next to us about what’s down on the court impact the game? Now I’m asking you to get 
on the court and share from being on the court. Here’s how it starts: “Who were you with?” 
“You said what?” “What did they say?” 
Wearing a dark gray sweater-vest with black slacks, Erhard appeared in the back of the room, 
watching the interaction. 
BETTY
I phoned my brother last night, and I told him, in the beginning of him harassing me to make a 
decision of being here, that I wasn’t sure of... that I blamed him...
KIPP
You said you blamed him?
BETTY
I said I blamed him. This is the conversation that we had. “I blamed you Bob for me being here 
because I didn’t want to be here. It’s your fault and I hate you for it.” 
KIPP (to the group)
You’re right there with her because she’s not talking about sharing, she’s sharing. You’re right 
there on the phone with her. Then what did you tell him?
BETTY
I told him that I was sorry for how I felt, that I had no right to feel that way, that I was the one 
who was wrong and selfi sh.
KIPP
And he said?
BETTY
He said that he loved me, and that the reason that he wanted me here was because it would be 
good for me. And I told him that I didn’t want to see it from his point of view; to see it from my 
point of view, and it took me to get through yesterday to realize that. I got through that point. 
I realized it. I’m here. It’s great for me. And I told him that I appreciated him for making that 
decision for harassing me.

KIPP
Whether it’s convincing you or harassing you, neither ever happened. In the sense of what 
happened, your brother spoke to you. 
BETTY
In a sense it didn’t and in another sense it did. 
KIPP
It’s called describing it. He spoke to you. 
(to the group)
What she just shared with you just about never happens after two days of anything in your life. 
This isn’t a new situation; this is, however, many years between her and her brother and two 
days. It’s hard to be present to that; it’s hard to see because it seems like two years. 
BETTY
I hated being here the fi rst two days. 
KIPP
No you didn’t... You had those thoughts. Did you have anything to do with any of those 
thoughts? 
BETTY
No.
KIPP
No. It was like the rain.
BETTY
It was like the rain.
KIPP
Stop identifying with the rain.
ERHARD (entering the conversation)
He’s making a slightly diff erent point, and it would be useful for everybody to get it. That’s not 
you thinking. The stuff  going on in your head is not yours. It doesn’t belong to you. You didn’t 
invent it, or generate it. It’s thoughts you’re having. I want you to be able to think that what’s 
going on when you’re thinking is not you thinking. You’re having thoughts. It thinks. I’m having 
the thoughts it thinks. In the book, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat—there was such 
a man—he actually thought his wife was a hat. And you mistake it thinking for you thinking. 
Not you personally. People mistake it thinking for them thinking just like the guy who mistook 
his wife for a hat. You have to do some thinking to get that. It thinks, and you have the thoughts 
that it thinks. You want to stop being so entangled in your thinking. You want to be able to 
IN-ORDER-TO
Here Erhard is characterizing the current clearing for Being as 
calculative—as technological—wherein everything is placed in 
reserve, standing by, ready to be used—everything including our 
selves (please see the series of sidebars on technology during the
third and final session of Day Four). Since we have not recognized
the technological clearing as a paradigm, a particular way of being 
which we have been sent, we see it as simply the way things—
including our selves—are. The in-order-to of standing-reserve, not

stand back a bit and watch it think. You think you’re limited to what it thinks. But that’s it 
thinking. It has thought you into a lot of pain and suff ering, unhappiness, and dissatisfaction. 
And it has a purpose, like a machine. It is designed in-order-to. It is not designed in order 
to leave you with love, fulfi llment, and full self-expression. Have you got any idea what it’s 
designed in-order-to? It’s designed in order to make you look good. That’s its design function.
(in the aisle among the group)
And it uses thinking and feeling, interpretations, what you believe to be true, in order to make 
you look good. It utilizes and organizes those elements and generates those elements in a form 
designed to make you look good. What does it mean to look good? Well, specifi cally, it means 
to make you right and others wrong, to foster your dominating and to avoid the domination 
of anything else. And it uses your thinking and your feelings, and your perceptions and your 
interpretations, conclusions, etc., to justify yourself; except yourself and it have become one. 
You have identifi ed with it. You are an it; you are an anybody. What makes you an anybody 
is you identify with it. You identify with its thinking and its feeling, and that makes you an 
anybody, and the costs are love, happiness, and self-expression. It thinks and you have its 
thoughts, and it thinks in order to make you look good, and what it costs you to identify with it 
is love, happiness, vitality, and self-expression. 
BETTY
I think the thing that hit me the strongest was the racket. When I could identify my racket and 
my reason for allowing things to take place in my life and receive the cost that I received from it, 
was the identifi cation of breaking through the barrier of all of this. I felt like this ton of bricks 
was lifted from my shoulders, being able to acknowledge that. And I realize what I was doing...
ERHARD
See—hold on. It doesn’t think like that. What she’s speaking doesn’t have anything to do with 
looking good, does it? As a matter of fact if you were real concerned with looking good you 
would never say what she just said. You can’t say what she just said without thinking, because it 
might make you look bad. Go on.
BETTY
I realized the cost that I was paying for the racket I was having. 
ERHARD
Running. You run a racket.
BETTY
The racket I was running. In allowing myself to be used for acceptance.
ERHARD
Kipp and I may have to go home and let her do this. That’s extraordinarily powerful to 
recognize that your life doesn’t belong to you. That it’s using your life for its purposes. And its 
confronted as the “it” which we have been sent, becomes “us.”
The “giant cybernetic system,” to use Hubert Dreyfus’ s phrase, 
has thereby been set in motion: “We don’t produce the clearing. 
The clearing produces us” (“Gaining a Free Relationship to
Technology,” Applied Heidegger Conference).
We have become both the “it” which acts in-order-to, and, as 
the they-self/identity, one of those entities which is subject to the 
in-order-to of the “it.” Erhard has summarized the result of this 
system:
“
When you are that you are the identity “I”—when
you are that you are that—and you couple that 
with what “it” is up to, you get a very powerful 
look into how this what-it’s-up-to is translated
into our everyday way of Being-in-the-world, 
into our everyday engagement with our everyday
concerns. What “it” is concerned with, once 
you are that you are it. . . what “it” is up to is 
making you right. . . and making anything else by
contrast wrong. (“The Heart of the Matter”)
In Being and Time, the in-order-to is also shown by Heidegger 
to be a central element of the existential structure of Dasein. As we 
have shown elsewhere, Dasein is always in the world in such a way
that it is concerned about things—getting them done, producing
d
them, giving them up, considering them, and so forth (BT 83–84,
T
96)—and our understanding of the world is mediated through
these concerns (see the sidebar “Concern” during Session Four 
of Day One). Heidegger calls the things we encounter in this way
equipment, and in-order-to is a characteristic of equipment: 
“
Equipment is essentially ‘something in-order-
to. . . .’ A totality of equipment is constituted
by various ways of the ‘in-order-to,’ such 
as serviceability, conduciveness, usability,
manipulability. [. . .] Dealings with equipment
subordinate themselves to the manifold 
assignments of the ‘in-order-to.’ (BT 97, 98)

purposes are looking good--all that stuff  up on the board specifi cally--that’s what looking good 
looks like: being right, making other people and other things wrong, dominating, avoiding 
domination, justifying yourself and invalidating others, and other things. When you come to see 
that that’s what your life is being used for, you’ve gotten pretty close to the source of your self. 
You’ve gotten pretty close to the source of your identity. Pretty close to the source of that with 
which you’ve confused your self. Go on.
BETTY
He was right that I allow myself to be used for acceptance. That was the cost that I was paying. 
I didn’t enjoy the cost I was receiving. I made them wrong to be right when I was the one who 
was wrong. 
KIPP
Even though she didn’t enjoy the cost she was receiving, it was familiar. And what you call 
comfortable is what is familiar, what you are used to. She doesn’t know now how to relate to her 
brother. She knows how to relate to him before: make him wrong. But now she has to be in the 
presence of the risk...
ERHARD
She’s got to make up a relationship with her brother. That’s called “invent.” She’s got to invent a 
relationship with her brother. Another word for that is “create”: create a relationship with her 
brother. You want to think about that a little bit: The possibility of living life as a creative act, 
where you don’t have an answer when you stand in front of the canvas. What you’ve got is an 
empty canvas, possibility. You create something in the empty space of not knowing how to be 
there already. Knowing how to be there already is nothing more than the past coming around to 
meet you in the future. Sure she knows how to relate to her brother that way she’s always been. 
That’s comfortable. It’s uncomfortable to stand in front of an empty canvas. It’s uncomfortable 
because you’re at risk. You might make a fool of yourself. You might be conned. You might get 
taken advantage of. You don’t like that, visit the surgeon and get a lobotomy. 
BETTY
It doesn’t just stop at my brother.
ERHARD
Obviously it doesn’t stop at your brother. Somebody who says “I hate, I hate, I hate”—that is 
“disgruntled and unhappy” waiting-to-happen. Suppose she doesn’t have this as a way to start 
every morning? Suppose she doesn’t have that as a way to walk into work? She’ll have to create 
a way to walk into work, and create a way to walk into her relationships with her family, and 
create a way to walk into relationships with men in her life—instead of being sour to start with 
before anything happens.
BETTY
I stay sour constantly.
referentiality, a frame of reference for our understanding—a
“towards-which” for all of our/its dealings in the world. And the 
primary towards-which, says Heidegger, is always the “for-the-
sake-of-which” that Dasein itself is: “the ‘for-the-sake-of’ always
pertains to the Being of Dasein, for which, in its Being, that very
Being is essentially an issue” (BT 116–117). My concerns and my
T
actions always circle back to my own Being, always defined by
the in-order-to: “In so far as Dasein exists factically, it understands
itself in the way its ‘for-the-sake-of-itself’ is thus connected with
some current ‘in-order-to’” (BT 416).
T
One of The Forum’s central purposes is the unconcealment
of the in-order-to, which is the design function of the “it”—the 
calculative thinking which characterizes the technological clear-
ing. Erhard has pointed out that recognizing his own thrownness 
to in-order-to was central in the development of his thinking. 
During his 1971 experience of ontological insight, from which the
est Training was generated, he says:
t
“
I realized that I actually didn’t know anything. Ev-
erything that I knew had a tag on it, and the name 
of the tag was “in order to.” So I knew this in order 
to, I knew that in order to, et cetera. Everything
t
was somehow a part of a story about how it was 
going to advance me or how it could be used, or 
how it could benefit people, or whatever it might 
be. Nothing lived on its own. (Simon  37)
As we will show in the closing Interval for Day Four of The Forum,
the danger of the technological clearing, for Heidegger, is that we
are oblivious to its nature and are thus denied access to the truth 
of aletheia: “Through [the technological destining of enframing]
the other possibility is blocked,” said Heidegger, that human 
being “might rather be admitted sooner and ever more primally
to the essence of what is unconcealed and to its unconcealment 
[aletheia]” (“QCT” in BW 331).

ERHARD
See, look. If she won the Nobel Prize that would be less important to her life than what she just 
said. There’s nothing more important for her to say. Because once she can own that, there’s a 
possibility beyond that. And until she can own that, there’s no possibility beyond that. All there 
is, is shucking and jiving around that: one ploy after another ploy—trying not to be that way, to 
fi nding out you are that way, giving in to being that way, making up your mind to be some other 
way, trying not to be that way, fi xing being that way—it’s all a trap like having your foot nailed 
to the fl oor and running around real fast.
BETTY
I’m going to fi x it.
KIPP
What do you mean by that? Because it’s going to be misheard.
BETTY
I’m going to fi x it by acknowledging my racket. When my racket goes to swing I’m going to 
stop it. Because I’m not going to allow myself to pay the costs, just for me to be right and make 
everyone wrong. Feel what I’m feeling. I’m going to take full control of it. 
ERHARD
Most of that’s pretty good. A little “fi x it” in there; a little “stop it” in there. Most of it is 
responsibility for it. And to the degree that she can be responsible for it, to the degree she can 
be with it—be with it and be responsible for it—these words are synonymous, by the way—to the 
degree that she can be responsible for it, to that degree she’s not limited to it. It’s not going to 
go away. That’s who she is. That’s the identity she’s built for herself. It’s gonna be there forever. 
And to the degree she can be with that, there’s a possibility beyond that. We’re too far into today 
now, so I’m going to stop talking like that.
KIPP
What you’re present to is the distinction sharing. There’s no manipulation, no in-order-to. 
That’s what sharing sounds like. This is what The Forum is about. So if you’re sitting in your 
chair, if you’re with whatever’s happening in her life with yours, if there’s a harmony, if it 
strikes a chord, then you should know that’s what this work is about. If you fi nd yourself in her 
speaking—if you fi nd yourself in your life in her life—that’s what we’re doing here. Out of her 
generosity—the truth is, out of her getting off  it—that’s what it sounds like when someone’s 
getting off  it. She had no life. What she had was hate and resentment and bitterness, and 
hate and resentment and bitterness were winning. We’re going to continue to distinguish this 
distinction “sharing.”
SUSAN 
I didn’t think you’d call on me.
Similarly, for Erhard, it is the in-order-to of the technological 
clearing which diminishes our experience of truth:
“ 
. . .if you take something which is true and add 
to it an “in order to” or even a “because” or 
a “therefore,” you’ve changed it. And you’ve 
changed it so dramatically that it’s no longer the 
truth. It’s the truth used for something—to prove
d
something, to coerce others, to be right or make 
someone else wrong. The truth used like that isn’t 
the truth any more. It’s closer to a lie—something 
pretending to be the truth. (Simon, ibid. 38, em-
phasis added)
Here we find ourselves in another instance of the reflexive thinking
that characterizes the work of both Erhard and Heidegger: even
attempts to escape in-order-to are undertaken in order to escape
in-order-to. Consequently, much of The Forum is devoted to the 
distinction of a possibility beyond in-order-to. As Forum leader 
Roger Armstrong told the Openings participants during this 1989 
Forum, “To do one thing that’s not in-order-to” could be worth the 
entire four days of The Forum. The paradox—embedded deeply in 
Heidegger’s central distinction, appropriation—is that one can get 
beyond in-order-to only by allowing and owning the inevitability of 
in-order-to. ■

SUSAN
Well I called my husband last night, and he’s the one I thought had forced me to do it. 
KIPP 
Let’s get a little more rigorous. You had the thought...
SUSAN
Right. We were recently married in October. He participated in The Forum a couple of months 
ago. When he came back from it he was so excited and he was great. He was excited about 
our relationship—which was wonderful. But what really bothered me was that he said it was 
because of The Forum. And that bugged me. My husband told me the reason he married me 
was because of The Forum. That is a bunch of garbage; “You married me because you love me, 
and there’s nobody who is making you marry me.” I went to Forum Introductory meetings and 
didn’t like it because they wanted to work on me. 
KIPP
No, you didn’t like it because you’re a creep. 
SUSAN
Right. Yesterday I was sitting in here, and all these people have these major problems. I don’t 
see a major problem in my life. And then I said, “my gosh, that’s one right there.”
KIPP (to the group)
That’s big. Some of you haven’t gotten here yet. Slow group.
SUSAN
As I developed it in my mind, I realized I got to share this, and so I put my hand up. “Now what 
if he calls on me? I have to make sure I got this all planned out to say it right.” Then I realized: 
I’m terrifi ed.  
KIPP
That’s the point. The rest was fi ll. Keep going, please.
SUSAN
The thing that I came into The Forum to accomplish was to have the ability to fi nd the right 
position. I just moved up here, and I don’t have a job yet. I wanted to wait until after the 
holidays...

Wait. What’s true is you don’t have a job yet.

That’s right. I’m afraid I’m not going to fi nd the right position. I told him about my racket, that 
“I’m right only when it matters to you that you’re right. It doesn’t matter if either way is okay. 
But if you’re adamant about being right, then I want to be right.”
KIPP
It’s called new love. It’s a new marriage.
SUSAN
Anyway. Very diffi  cult for me.
KIPP
But that’s the important part. How diffi  cult it is. Everything that you call yourself is going to 
fi ght against it. Every justifi cation in the world is going to be there to shut up.
SUSAN
I was afraid that I would lose footing.
KIPP
That’s right. Marriage isn’t about loving, about being at risk: it’s about dominating and winning. 
SUSAN
I thought I didn’t want to dominate. I just didn’t want to be dominated. 
ERHARD (entering the conversation) 
Thanks for this Susan. Very useful conversation. Dominating and avoiding domination are two 
sides of the same mirror. It doesn’t mean be a patsy either. There’s an alternative to dominating and 
avoiding domination. There’s a possibility beyond that. And it’s not possible to see that until you 
see what it costs you to dominate or avoid domination. Most marriages are about dominating and 
avoiding domination. They’re about being right and avoiding being wrong. That’s what marriages 
are really about. They’re not about the stuff  they put in the fairy tales. And they’re always going to 
be about that because you and I didn’t make that up, we inherited that when we became human 
beings. And it’s only to the degree that you can own that, for there to be a possibility beyond that. 
What you’re doing now, looking at that and owning that, taking it on and seeing that that’s what 
owns your marriage: that starts to create the possibility of some power in the marriage. 
(pausing)
The other thing is, you want to be able to get to the point where you can be with what people 
say. Otherwise you’re going to be manipulated by what people say. See, whatever your husband 
said about The Forum: stupid. But you couldn’t be with it; it took your being away from you. 
SUSAN
He used a lot of the terminology that you used, and that drove me nuts because he acted kind of 
smug. You know he had found “it.” I hadn’t, so I had to go get “it.”

ERHARD
Yes. That’s the smell of enlightenment. You want to keep your enlightenment to yourself and 
not let the smell out. What you want to share with people is empowerment, not enlightenment. 
You want to watch doing enlightenment with people, and it’s possible to empower people. 
If someone says something stupid to you—I’m not telling you how to handle this, I’m just 
illustrating that there’s a way to be with it—if somebody says something stupid to you, you can 
say, “okay, I understand exactly what you’re saying.” That gives you much more of an opening 
than “that’s stupid.” I don’t talk like this outside of here. I don’t use all this jargon outside of 
here. I use it in here because there’s a reason to. Now, you’re going to be stupid. You’re going 
to use all the terminology inappropriately. And there’s not much you can do about it. It’s hard 
not to. If we could take it back before you left here, we would, so you would just be left with 
yourself. All this stuff  in here is not signifi cant. The only thing signifi cant is you. And you can 
work your way through those things with your husband now that you’re hip to what’s going 
on. It’s a pretty exciting thing to think about the possibility of marriage beyond the games in 
marriages.

So in sharing with your husband last night, you said?

I said “I’m sorry I was such a twit about signing up.”

Forum Day Three: Session One

ERHARD
And standing in the love that was there. Not a bad place to stand—talking about power. What 
you call love is not love: it’s love in-order-to; love to keep somebody around; or love to get 
something out of them; love because you need. That’s not love. When you take everything 
else away, what is left is love. When you take away “I was a twit,” and take away him being 
arrogant, what you’re left with is love for each other. And it doesn’t mean anything, but it’s 
extraordinarily powerful. And you can stand there and really make something happen in life—
like really create something worth creating. Fabulous.
SUSAN
During dinner last night I was expressing things that had bothered me before, and he said, “I 
think it should be a requirement for spouses, that when one takes it the other should take 
The Forum.” 
ERHARD
We like it to get bad fi rst, though. Makes it clearer about what you’re up to if it gets bad fi rst. 
SUSAN
I know because listening to everybody else yesterday, things they wanted to fi x, and I didn’t 
think I had anything--I just haven’t lived long enough.
ERHARD
You know, we do this with children. They’re as fucked up as you are. They’ve got all the same 
stuff  as you going on and they’re in the process of building their identity. And I’m probably one 
of the few people in the world who’s an expert on teenagers. And I know almost nothing about 
teenagers. The truth about teenagers is that they’re human. People are insulted when I say that. 
But when you live with a teenager, you’re not sure. 
 
(laughter)
The truth is that teenagers are adults. That’s hard to get, because they’re a weird kind of adult. 
They’re adults who don’t have their act together well enough to get it bought all the time. And 
it’s very painful to get called on your act. Very painful. Adults are teenagers with their act so 
well put together that they almost never get called on it. Very simple and very powerful.
SUSAN
I see that as I was looking for a job I was afraid of telling my husband for fear he might make 
me continue if it didn’t work out. 
KIPP
Yeah, don’t establish a network of support for yourself.
SUSAN
He might force me: “Just in case it doesn’t feel good you can jump right out.”

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Susan brought up something important about living in fear all the time. The truth you’re going 
to fi nd out today is that you live in fear all the time. It’s so pervasive that for you it’s become 
ordinary. So it’s only when you’re overwhelmed by fear that you notice that you’re frightened. 
But the fear is there all the time: “afraid I might get stuck with this”; “afraid I might get boxed 
in.” It’s there all the time. This is an experiment to see what it looks like to live in fear and don’t 
call it that. Call it “everyday living.” The more forceful you are, the more frightened you are. 
You’re just overcompensating for the fear, so to speak. Why do you suppose it takes courage? 
The more frightened you are the more courage you need. The more forceful you are the more 
frightened you are.
SUSAN
I’m not really sure. I keep being confused. My natural tendency is to want to fi x it. 
ERHARD
No, it’s not your natural tendency; it’s its natural tendency. 
SUSAN
Its natural tendency. I keep looking for something. 
ERHARD
Right, to try to fi x it. And whatever you try to fi x gets permanent-ized.
SUSAN
I can’t wait to be able to share equally with my husband.
ERHARD
Well done. Just one point about not sharing in-order-to. Sharing attracts. Looking good ensnares, 
and sharing attracts. You don’t build relationships talking about what you think. You build 
relationships by speaking yourself, and listening self; listening for the self there, not listening 
for the story there. If you listen for self, people will speak their selves. If you listen for crap, people 
will tell you their crap. If you listen for self, people will tell you their crap fi rst, but they’ll get 
around to speaking themselves.

ERHARD (to the group)
You’ve got to have advanced training to know that about yourself.
ANDY
My life’s been about being a sleaze. The question was “what do you care most about in life?” 
and I said “I care about making a diff erence with people.” And I see that isn’t it. I care about 
making a diff erence with young people and I could give a fuck about adults. And my actions 
show that. So who I am with an adult is a snake in the grass.
ERHARD
That’s pretty popular. I’m for this and the hell with everything else. That doesn’t give you any 
power with what you’re for.
ANDY (replaying a conversation he had)
So she said, “what do you get out of that?” I said, “well, I get to look good. Mr. morality. Mr. 
right. Look like I’m honest—all the good stuff  that goes along with it. It was all fun and games 
at fi rst.” “What’s the cost?” “I don’t see no cost. Maybe self-expression. Tell people what I’m 
really thinking because I’m being manipulative.” “Well what about love?” “I could give a fuck 
about love: I’ve got my family. I got all the love I need.” And then she said, “how could you do 
what you do? You fucking hurt people, you use people, you lie. How would you feel if someone 
was doing that to you all the time? And that’s all you’re doing.” And it does hurt. It hurts deep 
inside. I was denying it.
KIPP (moving closer to Andy)
You were doing what you’ve done your entire life. 
ANDY
I’m not denying it anymore. I am a sleaze.
KIPP
Being a sleaze is a nice handy phrase that doesn’t let you be present to what’s there in your life. 
ANDY
I don’t trust adults.
KIPP 
That’s a concept. “I don’t trust adults” is saying information about it. 
(clapping his hands) 
That sound is present. What’s present when you’re with adults? 
ANDY
I don’t know.

KIPP
See, you got hurt, didn’t you, when you were growing up? 
ANDY 
Yeah.
KIPP
See how you said “yeah”? So today your job is to get present to your own life. And you gloss 
over it by saying you’re a sleaze. People aren’t interested in things, people are interested in you. 
We give people things, we don’t give them our selves. You’re a guy walking around with a chip 
on your shoulder, and the chip has become your life.
ANDY
Right.
ERHARD (coming forward)
Hold on, hold on a minute. A lot of people in here with a chip on their shoulder. How many 
people in here have a chip on their shoulder? I’m looking around here to see if the right hands 
are up. 
Erhard pointed out a couple of people to indicate that they needed to have their hands raised. He 
addressed one of them.
(continuing)
That costs you your beauty, you know that? You’re a beautiful woman. Nobody can see that 
with that fucking chip on your shoulder; takes your power away from you.
KIPP
Anything more?
ANDY
Just that it is so powerful.
KIPP
Right. The chip on your shoulder uses your life.
ANDY
Like a drug.
KIPP
Thank you.

KIPP (to the group)
I’m inviting you to keep being present to sharing.
XAVIER
I called my girlfriend. I think I’m getting things. I kid myself about getting things, and I don’t 
know shit.
KIPP
Yeah. What do you do in life?
XAVIER
I’m a student.
KIPP
Of course, you have to be a student if you don’t know shit... Somebody that doesn’t know shit 
has to be a student—because you can’t be present to “I don’t know.” If you can get that you’re 
reporting when you’re reporting—that’s worth the four days... “I was talking about rackets” is 
reporting. “I said I was full of shit” is sharing. And what did your girlfriend say?
XAVIER 
That I was just reporting on things.
KIPP
Listen. That’s worth his four days. If you can get that you’re reporting when you’re reporting, 
it’s worth the four days. And?
XAVIER
I said that I am full of shit; I am running rackets all the time.
KIPP
She said?
XAVIER
She shared about how uncomfortable it is to be called on her rackets. It’s embarrassing.
KIPP
Being alive is embarrassing. If you don’t want to be embarrassed, stay dead. 
ERHARD
It’s embarrassing to be yourself. Ask any teenager, he’ll tell you. That’s why teenagers put an 
act together. It’s innately embarrassing to be yourself. That’s how you get to be an adult when 
you’re a teenager. You learn not to be yourself. It’s true about everybody in the room. You want 
to get that. It’s embarrassing to be yourself.

You start participating in your own life, it’s going to be awkward and embarrassing for you. It 
took about three years to train me. I was too embarrassed to be with people.
(prompting Xavier to keep sharing rather than describing) 
And you said? And she said? 
XAVIER
We broke up on Tuesday. 
KIPP
Good. Always break up before The Forum. You might get lucky in here.
(laughter)
Careful. You’re having fun. It might be a shock to your system.
(laughter)
XAVIER
I’m sitting here during The Forum having these thoughts. 
KIPP
No, the thoughts are having you. And the thoughts say?
XAVIER
I’m a worthless piece of shit. 
Kipp crossed the platform to the table, picked up a box of tissues, and used the tissues to demonstrate 
Xavier’s “thoughts” that he was “identifying with,” and “being owned by.” Kipp did this by pulling 
a tissue from the box, wafting it through the air, and inserting it into one of his nostrils, and then 
another in the other nostril, to much laughter.
KIPP (with tissues in his nostrils, regarding Xavier)
And you go?
XAVIER
I’ll never amount to anything.
KIPP (fi lling both ears with tissues; laughter)
And the next thought? 
XAVIER
It’s hopeless.

This is what you’ve been calling you.
XAVIER
I see the payoff s and the costs, but now what?
KIPP
Two more days, that’s what.
Xavier sat down looking considerably lighter than when he had stood up. Another participant, Edna, 
stood next.
EDNA
When I came in here I had a bag of negatives with me.
KIPP
“A bag of negatives” is a description. 
EDNA
I didn’t want to be here. I have six children and grandchildren in this Forum. I thought we were 
all going to do The Forum together. It didn’t take me long to realize that they were going to do 
their Forum and I was going to do my Forum. I kept looking for where in the room my family 
was. At one point, I saw my son walking toward the door. I feared for his and my looking good. I 
realized how much looking good had been running my life. It’s not anymore. 
KIPP
It is anymore. It is there. But you’ve got some choice now in how it uses you.
 
(to the group)
What you’re listening to is a mother whose children became trophies.
ERHARD
Like all mothers: you lose yourself. You become your children. Let me tell you something: you 
have very little to do with the way your children grow up. Look at yourself. You did it the way 
you wanted to do it. But everyone has bullshit about “They made me.” Kids like to eat. “If you 
want to eat in this house, do this and this and this. If you don’t want to eat, do something else.” 
I told my son, “I don’t feed you because I love you. It’s against the law not to feed you.” You 
lose yourself and become your children. The single most important thing you have to give your 
children is your own well-being, and make sure they don’t get in the way. They may not use it 
wisely, but your self is what you’ve got to give them. The one thing I could never get away from 
with my mother was who she was. But I forgot everything she told me.
EDNA
They didn’t know the reason for me wanting them to look good: so that I would look good.
AWAKENING ATTUNEMENTS
Werner Erhard has consistently denied that his work is 
appropriately characterized by the term philosophy. But he
has issued this denial in a cultural context where philosophy is 
generally regarded as a purely academic pursuit, in which one
studies the thinking of great thinkers in order to gain knowledge 
and perhaps thereby to attain wisdom. 
The people who direct this study are professors of philosophy, 
but are rarely considered publicly to be themselves philosophers; 
our culture has no clear or off icial requirements for that desig-
nation. The academic process generally entails learning about
philosophy, not doing philosophy. This is not necessarily the
aim of the professors, but arises from the constricting assump-
tions of the current paradigm that structures the processes of 
acquiring knowledge within academic settings. Given this way of 
understanding the term “philosophy,” it clearly does not describe 
Erhard’s methodology. 
But certainly, as Erhard has acknowledged, his work does 
address many of the concerns of philosophy (“The Heart of the
Matter”), concerns that are likewise central in the work of Martin
Heidegger, who is considered as off icial a “philosopher” as anyone 
from the twentieth century. In Germany during the prime of his
career, between 1920 and the 1960s, Heidegger was immersed 
in a culture that revered both the academic system itself and in
particular the academic discipline of philosophy. In responding to
this opportunity, he rose to pre-eminence as an academic and as a 
philosopher. (Please see Michael E. Zimmerman’s Aft erword to this

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
If you were going to design a universe you would not design growing up like people do it. But 
that’s the way it is. It’s messy. The single most important issue between parents and children is 
that they love each other. And that’s almost never the discussion. It doesn’t make you a better 
person to clean your room. The point is to have a little straightness in the conversation. It’s a 
diffi  cult process at best. There are no experts on raising children. No one has the code. It’s very 
powerful what Edna is talking about. You’ve got to keep getting off  it with your children too. 
The interesting thing about kids: if you get off  it with them, they’ll get off  it with you. When 
you’re being straight with them, it occurs to them they might be straight with you. Great, Edna. 
Good stuff , really good stuff .

Where’s Jane? 
The young woman who had spoken the previous day (Day Two, Session Four) about her father and 
stepmother stood. 
ERHARD
What happened to sad? 
JANE
I don’t know.
ERHARD
Do you really not know, or do you not want to talk about it?
JANE
I think I was sad because... it was all up here. I was scared so much.
ERHARD
What do you mean “I think”?
JANE
I know.
ERHARD
What you’re saying is “I was feeling emotional because I was standing up in front of a group of 
people.” What happened that you feel that way? Don’t say “I don’t know” ever again.
JANE
Something that happened that I don’t remember.
ERHARD
Can you remember a time when you stood up in front of a group of people?
book to provide further context concerning questionable political 
judgments of Heidegger the “man,” which put at risk the substan-
tial innovations and contributions of Being and Time and of his
other writings.)
The contribution and innovation of Heidegger’s thinking that 
is central to our study includes his particular path of thinking,
a path that reached beyond the academic context in which he 
worked and thrived, and into the domain of ontology. Working
persistently in this domain for more than five decades, he strove to 
honor the discipline of philosophy by committing his life to under-
mining its foundational concepts.
Embedded throughout his many published volumes is a per-
spective on philosophy, and its relation to language, that strongly 
resonates with Werner Erhard’s approach to ontological inquiry.
In the lectures published as The Fundamental Concepts of Meta-
physics, for example, Heidegger is elusive regarding philosophy’s
nature. Philosophy is
“
not some mere gathering of knowledge that we 
can easily obtain for ourselves any time from 
books, but (we know this only obscurely) some-
thing to do with the whole, something extreme,
where an ultimate pronouncement and interlocu-
tion occurs on the part of human beings. (FCM 4,
M
emphasis added).
He is emphatic on one point: “Philosophy is philosophizing. . . .
It itself is only whenever we are philosophizing.” Philosophy 
emerges in acts of languaging; and if it is authentic philosophy, it 
emerges newly in each iteration, “however much we seem merely 
to be repeating the same thing” (FCM 4). Frequently in The Forum, 
Erhard calls out the participants whom he hears codifying their 
experiences as beliefs. Authentic philosophy rips space open newly 
in every articulation; it is philosophizing that never calcifies into 
philosophy. 
Further, Heidegger suggested the direction that philosophical
dialogue should move in the current epoch. The task concerns at-
tunements, which are ways of being open to the world. A human be-
ing is never just open; we are always open in some particular way.
