Forum Day Three: Session Two Interval

and culture—the meanings, the values and standards, the art and the traditions,
the metaphors—make available a particular way of understanding the world, and
our lives are lived within the possibilities and limitations of that understanding. In
our current understanding, made available by the metaphysical tradition, Being has
been forgotten. In our world, there was no possibility of Being.
Therefore the work of both of these men was directed toward the creation
of new terminology; and one of the terms that has been central for Erhard, and
that has served the function of what might best be called “originary naming,” is
languaging (see the “Primordial Metaphor: Clearing” sidebar in Session Two of Day
Four). While the word language, as a noun, indicates a formal structure of words and
rules and the uses toward which they are commonly put within a given linguistic
community, “languaging” as a verb form indicates an action that is not merely
putting the words and rules of language to use. Languaging indicates the action of
generating new meanings, thereby creating new ways of understanding the world.
The creation of distinctions, which is the central element of The Forum, is a process
of languaging new contexts or clearings for understanding, which make possible
new ways of being and acting in the world.
For Heidegger, thinking a way to the presence of Being involved not only the
creation of a new vocabulary for the human condition, but also a thinking back
into history to discover how the earliest philosophers in Western culture languaged
their understanding of the world, and why this understanding devolved into the
ideas of the metaphysical tradition. Students of Western philosophy generally begin
their studies with Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle; these philosophers are the most
familiar to us because in their work we find the beginnings of our own tradition of
thinking. But there was an earlier group of thinkers in ancient Greece whose ideas
are in some ways at odds with that tradition, men in whose thinking a possibility
emerged briefly that was never thought again, and has since been forgotten. It is in
the writing of these men that Heidegger finds what he is seeking.
David Farrell Krell, in his introduction to Heidegger’s Basic Writings, tells us
that as a seventeen-year-old student, Heidegger read a German scholar’s thesis
(Franz Brentano) on Aristotle’s understanding of Being. The experience provoked his
thinking, and led him to seek out Aristotle’s own Metaphysics, where he found the
question that would guide him for the rest of his life: “The question that was raised
in earliest times, that we raise today and that will always be raised and will always
be a matter of perplexity [is]: ti to on, What is being?” (Aristotle, Metaphysics, VII, 3,
1028b, 2–4). Here Krell imagines Heidegger’s perplexity:
“
Had some Polonius asked the young man what he was reading
in his two books on “being,” he might well have answered,
“words, words, words.” German words from recent times trying
to translate Latin words from a bygone age that were trying to
translate Greek words from antiquity. But what were the Greek
words trying to translate? (Krell, “Introduction,” BW 5, emphasis
W
added)
It was this mystery that ultimately led Heidegger to his etymological explorations of
the earliest Greek philosophers. It puzzled him that although Aristotle’s writing had
been foundational in the development of almost every area of human intellectual
activity, his most profound question, while it had generated two thousand years
of scholarly disputation on the subject of ontology, seemed now to have lost its
meaning.
Heidegger’s focus in his quest was the work of those philosophers traditionally
known as the pre-Socratics—particularly Heraclitus and Parmenides—who lived and
wrote in the fift h and sixth centuries BCE. As Heidegger saw it, this brief historical
period was a particularly explosive time in the evolution of human understanding.
The pre-Socratics were not the first human beings to use language, but in
Heidegger’s view, they were the first to consider the diff erence it made that they,
among all beings, were the language-users; and they left  a written record of their
thinking, of which only fragments remain.
As the first philosophers of the West, these early thinkers made decisions about
the meaning of what they saw, and their decisions set Western culture on the path
which eventually evolved into the metaphysical tradition. “[W]e constantly return to
the Greek conception of Being,” says Heidegger, “because this conception, though
entirely flattened out and rendered unrecognizable, is the conception that still rules
even today in the West—not only in the doctrines of philosophy but in the most
everyday routines” (IM 64–65).
Therefore, to locate the source of this tradition and to discover how it might
have been otherwise, Heidegger has turned to the writing of those philosophers.
Their work survives only in brief fragments, but for Heidegger they provide
evidence of a crucial moment in the history of the West. They speak of “what since
ancient times is to-be-thought but is still unthought” (EGT 4). Here Krell, one of the
translators of Early Greek Thinking, characterizes the fragments:
210
SPEAKING BEING
“
Each is a truncated monument of thinking. Like the torso of a
river god or the temple of Poseidon at Sounion, each fragment
conveys a sense of loss, of tragic withdrawal and absence; yet
each is a remnant of an exhilarating presence. . . .  (EGT 4)
T
Only indirectly do the fragments indicate their subject matter. . . .
These merest fragments seem to talk about everything,
g all being,
g
whatever is. We moderns are convinced that this is nonsense. . . .
(EGT 7)
T
But Heidegger reads these words with the eyes of a man who is relentless in his
commitment to hear the language of Being; and what he has found provides us with
a new perspective on the way Western thought has understood the world for two
millennia (EGT Intro 5).
Is Heidegger’s understanding of pre-Socratic thinking credible? Is it persuasive?
His reading challenges the traditional translations, and as Krell acknowledges, his
interpretations are distressing, even violent:
“
Although Heidegger takes each word of the fragments
seriously—rather because he does so—his thinking plies a
dangerous, uncharted course which we are at pains to
follow. . . . But it is the violence inherent in any attempt to
cross over to that foreign shore, the violence by which we
overcome inertia and translate ourselves to the matter of
early Greek thinking. (EGT 11)
T
As we have noted in the last Interval (“The Forgetting of Being, Part Three of Eight”),
several scholars find Heidegger’s etymologies controversial, including one of his
recent translators, Richard Polt, who calls them idiosyncratic and oft en “fanciful,”
and wonders whether Heidegger is “so attracted to the pre-Socratics because
they survive only in fragments whose interpretation can easily be skewed in a
Heideggerian direction” (HI 133). But Polt nevertheless concludes that despite their
idiosyncrasy (or perhaps because of it), his readings succeed in shedding new light
on the tradition.
Heidegger reads the writing of the pre-Socratics to unconceal the language of
Being. As we will see, what he finds has substantial relevance for our inquiry into the
work of Werner Erhard.

SPEAKING BEING
When The Forum resumed at 4:30 pm, Kipp was on the platform. Erhard was present, seated on the
platform’s edge. Kipp asked participants to share what they had found out about their lives. A young
man named Tony stood and said that he had sensed “the joke of it all.”
TONY (continuing)
I remembered when I was six my mom took me to Taiwan and once I got off  the plane there
were all these children with missing fi ngers and hands and arms asking for money and I was
terrifi ed. And I saw that everybody is afraid of everybody and that’s what’s wrong with this
world.
KIPP
When you got off  the airplane, what happened at that moment?
TONY
I felt really bad.
ERHARD
The most important thing you said is that it’s all a joke. That’s what we’ve been heading for the
past couple of days. All that stuff  about rackets and being afraid and all that stuff —that’s not
important.
TONY
And I’ve been all afraid that “I’m not going to get what I came to get out of The Forum! I’m not
going to be able to have what I want in my life.”
ERHARD
You want to know what? You’re not!
TONY (laughing)
And now that we got that cleared...
ERHARD
Yeah, well, once everybody gets that cleared we can all go home.
TONY
There really is nothing to get.
ERHARD
That’s right.
TONY (laughing)
What the fuck am I doing in here?
