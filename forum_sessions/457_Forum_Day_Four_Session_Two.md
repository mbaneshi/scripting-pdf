Forum Day Four: Session Two

ROSS
I had this distinction of choice at some point, and then I made a choice called “no” when I
really wanted to say “yes,” and now I can’t say no anymore. So when faced with big things, real
choices, I say yes, and then look around and say “what did I get myself into?”
KIPP
Consider that you lost the distinction “choice.” It got folded back into reasons and thoughts
and feelings. What’s going to empower you in the matter is to work with this choice business,
to actually see: “Oh I see, choice is simply a choice. Me choosing. I choose whatever because I
choose whatever. You stopped being the chooser. You called a decision a choice and got them
muddled up again.
ROSS (hesitant)
Yeah...
At this point Wes rejoined the conversation.
WES
We’re not saying choice is right. We’re saying choice is choice. We’re not saying decision is
wrong. We’re saying decision is decision. They’re diff erent games. You don’t want to play one
game and call it the other. That’s pretty silly. Mixing them up is like dressing up to play football
and then walking out onto the baseball fi eld, and the pitcher throws the ball to the catcher and
you tackle the catcher.
(laughter)r
Does that look like your life Ross?
ROSS
Exactly. I really got that because sometimes the circumstances are really overwhelming and I
give into them, and instead of saying that I gave in to the circumstances and made a decision, I
say “Oh, I chose that.”
WES
You should decide when deciding is the game you want to play and be responsible for the pro-
cess called decision. Choosing is distinguishing a way of being with life. And there are appropri-
ate times for deciding.
ROSS
Or at least be clear when you decided or when you chose. At least you’re on the right ball fi eld
and can play that game.
WES
In your game—you’re a physician, right?—you better make decisions.

SPEAKING BEING
ROSS
Sure. Lidocaine, epinephrine...
WES (to laughter)r
Well, “I did the operation because I chose to.” You get in a lot of trouble that way. That’s not
responsible. Choice puts you into a certain relationship to life like “responsible for.” It shifts your
relationship to what is. So now we need to do the real choice demo, right? So, all that stuff  we did?
That wasn’t it. We’re close. We did the “getting up to this place” choice demonstration. We haven’t
done the real one yet. There’s an illusion in the one we just did, which we are going to handle.
KIPP
So we want to distinguish choice as choice. Okay, ready?
(holding out one hand to a participant, Andy)
Chocolate. Choose.
ANDY
Chocolate.
KIPP
Chocolate: How come you chose chocolate?
ANDY
Because I chose chocolate.
KIPP
Yeah. And what else was there?
ANDY
No choice at all...
KIPP
Was there anything else other than chocolate?
ANDY
Yes.
KIPP
Where? Chocolate: choose!
ANDY
I choose chocolate.
