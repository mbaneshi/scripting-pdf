Forum Day Four: Session Three 459
AVRIL
Yeah.
KIPP
How would you feel about the runt of the litter unable to get to the mother’s milk?
AVRIL
I would feel sad.
KIPP
Well, that’s you. That’s your life. 
(making a sound like a puppy whining while trying to break into the litter; laughter erupts) 
This will be on your gravestone: “I couldn’t quite fi gure out what to do enough,” right?
AVRIL
Right.
KIPP
Some of you might be listening, “Well, it’s all right to be divorced”; “It’s all right to be married”: 
It’s all the same. Simply choose and that leaves you responsible, and what goes along with that. 
Now the consequences for what you are doing don’t seem to be nurturing you. Yes?
AVRIL
Right.
KIPP
My litmus test is always: What empowers you? What leaves you empowered?
AVRIL
Thanks.
KIPP
Thank you very much.

PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 11)
I discovered in this Forum that I decided to get married. I didn’t choose. 
KIPP
Something got you married, not you.
