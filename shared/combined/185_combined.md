Forum Day Three: Session One
171
SPEAKING
BEING
DAY THREE
Day three of The Forum began at 9:00 am, with The Forum leader, Kipp, on the platform asking
participants to share about the assignment from the previous evening: to share their experience of
The Forum with someone in their lives.
KIPP
When you talk about what happened, people are left, and you’re left, with whatever description
gives you. We’re going to call that domain of speaking “up in the stands.” Does talking to the
person next to us about what’s down on the court impact the game? Now I’m asking you to get
on the court and share from being on the court. Here’s how it starts: “Who were you with?”
“You said what?” “What did they say?”
Wearing a dark gray sweater-vest with black slacks, Erhard appeared in the back of the room,
watching the interaction.
BETTY
I phoned my brother last night, and I told him, in the beginning of him harassing me to make a
decision of being here, that I wasn’t sure of... that I blamed him...
KIPP
You said you blamed him?
BETTY
I said I blamed him. This is the conversation that we had. “I blamed you Bob for me being here
because I didn’t want to be here. It’s your fault and I hate you for it.”
KIPP (to the group)
You’re right there with her because she’s not talking about sharing, she’s sharing. You’re right
there on the phone with her. Then what did you tell him?
BETTY
I told him that I was sorry for how I felt, that I had no right to feel that way, that I was the one
who was wrong and selfi sh.
KIPP
And he said?
BETTY
He said that he loved me, and that the reason that he wanted me here was because it would be
good for me. And I told him that I didn’t want to see it from his point of view; to see it from my
point of view, and it took me to get through yesterday to realize that. I got through that point.
I realized it. I’m here. It’s great for me. And I told him that I appreciated him for making that
decision for harassing me.
FORUM DAY THREE
SESSION ONE

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
Whether it’s convincing you or harassing you, neither ever happened. In the sense of what
happened, your brother spoke to you.
BETTY
In a sense it didn’t and in another sense it did.
KIPP
It’s called describing it. He spoke to you.
(to the group)
What she just shared with you just about never happens after two days of anything in your life.
This isn’t a new situation; this is, however, many years between her and her brother and two
days. It’s hard to be present to that; it’s hard to see because it seems like two years.
BETTY
I hated being here the fi rst two days.
KIPP
No you didn’t... You had those thoughts. Did you have anything to do with any of those
thoughts?
BETTY
No.
KIPP
No. It was like the rain.
BETTY
It was like the rain.
KIPP
Stop identifying with the rain.
ERHARD (entering the conversation)
He’s making a slightly diff erent point, and it would be useful for everybody to get it. That’s not
you thinking. The stuff  going on in your head is not yours. It doesn’t belong to you. You didn’t
invent it, or generate it. It’s thoughts you’re having. I want you to be able to think that what’s
going on when you’re thinking is not you thinking. You’re having thoughts. It thinks. I’m having
the thoughts it thinks. In the book, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat—there was such
a man—he actually thought his wife was a hat. And you mistake it thinking for you thinking.
Not you personally. People mistake it thinking for them thinking just like the guy who mistook
his wife for a hat. You have to do some thinking to get that. It thinks, and you have the thoughts
that it thinks. You want to stop being so entangled in your thinking. You want to be able to
IN-ORDER-TO
Here Erhard is characterizing the current clearing for Being as
calculative—as technological—wherein everything is placed in
reserve, standing by, ready to be used—everything including our
selves (please see the series of sidebars on technology during the
third and final session of Day Four). Since we have not recognized
the technological clearing as a paradigm, a particular way of being
which we have been sent, we see it as simply the way things—
including our selves—are. The in-order-to of standing-reserve, not
Forum Day Three: Session One

stand back a bit and watch it think. You think you’re limited to what it thinks. But that’s it
thinking. It has thought you into a lot of pain and suff ering, unhappiness, and dissatisfaction.
And it has a purpose, like a machine. It is designed in-order-to. It is not designed in order
to leave you with love, fulfi llment, and full self-expression. Have you got any idea what it’s
designed in-order-to? It’s designed in order to make you look good. That’s its design function.
(in the aisle among the group)
And it uses thinking and feeling, interpretations, what you believe to be true, in order to make
you look good. It utilizes and organizes those elements and generates those elements in a form
designed to make you look good. What does it mean to look good? Well, specifi cally, it means
to make you right and others wrong, to foster your dominating and to avoid the domination
of anything else. And it uses your thinking and your feelings, and your perceptions and your
interpretations, conclusions, etc., to justify yourself; except yourself and it have become one.
You have identifi ed with it. You are an it; you are an anybody. What makes you an anybody
is you identify with it. You identify with its thinking and its feeling, and that makes you an
anybody, and the costs are love, happiness, and self-expression. It thinks and you have its
thoughts, and it thinks in order to make you look good, and what it costs you to identify with it
is love, happiness, vitality, and self-expression.
BETTY
I think the thing that hit me the strongest was the racket. When I could identify my racket and
my reason for allowing things to take place in my life and receive the cost that I received from it,
was the identifi cation of breaking through the barrier of all of this. I felt like this ton of bricks
was lifted from my shoulders, being able to acknowledge that. And I realize what I was doing...
ERHARD
See—hold on. It doesn’t think like that. What she’s speaking doesn’t have anything to do with
looking good, does it? As a matter of fact if you were real concerned with looking good you
would never say what she just said. You can’t say what she just said without thinking, because it
might make you look bad. Go on.
BETTY
I realized the cost that I was paying for the racket I was having.
ERHARD
Running. You run a racket.
BETTY
The racket I was running. In allowing myself to be used for acceptance.
ERHARD
Kipp and I may have to go home and let her do this. That’s extraordinarily powerful to
recognize that your life doesn’t belong to you. That it’s using your life for its purposes. And its
confronted as the “it” which we have been sent, becomes “us.”
The “giant cybernetic system,” to use Hubert Dreyfus’ s phrase,
has thereby been set in motion: “We don’t produce the clearing.
The clearing produces us” (“Gaining a Free Relationship to
Technology,” Applied Heidegger Conference).
We have become both the “it” which acts in-order-to, and, as
the they-self/identity, one of those entities which is subject to the
in-order-to of the “it.” Erhard has summarized the result of this
system:
“
When you are that you are the identity “I”—when
you are that you are that—and you couple that
with what “it” is up to, you get a very powerful
look into how this what-it’s-up-to is translated
into our everyday way of Being-in-the-world,
into our everyday engagement with our everyday
concerns. What “it” is concerned with, once
you are that you are it. . . what “it” is up to is
making you right. . . and making anything else by
contrast wrong. (“The Heart of the Matter”)
In Being and Time, the in-order-to is also shown by Heidegger
to be a central element of the existential structure of Dasein. As we
have shown elsewhere, Dasein is always in the world in such a way
that it is concerned about things—getting them done, producing
d
them, giving them up, considering them, and so forth (BT 83–84,
T
96)—and our understanding of the world is mediated through
these concerns (see the sidebar “Concern” during Session Four
of Day One). Heidegger calls the things we encounter in this way
equipment, and in-order-to is a characteristic of equipment:
“
Equipment is essentially ‘something in-order-
to. . . .’ A totality of equipment is constituted
by various ways of the ‘in-order-to,’ such
as serviceability, conduciveness, usability,
manipulability. [. . .] Dealings with equipment
subordinate themselves to the manifold
assignments of the ‘in-order-to.’ (BT 97, 98)

SPEAKING BEING
purposes are looking good--all that stuff  up on the board specifi cally--that’s what looking good
looks like: being right, making other people and other things wrong, dominating, avoiding
domination, justifying yourself and invalidating others, and other things. When you come to see
that that’s what your life is being used for, you’ve gotten pretty close to the source of your self.
You’ve gotten pretty close to the source of your identity. Pretty close to the source of that with
which you’ve confused your self. Go on.
BETTY
He was right that I allow myself to be used for acceptance. That was the cost that I was paying.
I didn’t enjoy the cost I was receiving. I made them wrong to be right when I was the one who
was wrong.
KIPP
Even though she didn’t enjoy the cost she was receiving, it was familiar. And what you call
comfortable is what is familiar, what you are used to. She doesn’t know now how to relate to her
brother. She knows how to relate to him before: make him wrong. But now she has to be in the
presence of the risk...
ERHARD
She’s got to make up a relationship with her brother. That’s called “invent.” She’s got to invent a
relationship with her brother. Another word for that is “create”: create a relationship with her
brother. You want to think about that a little bit: The possibility of living life as a creative act,
where you don’t have an answer when you stand in front of the canvas. What you’ve got is an
empty canvas, possibility. You create something in the empty space of not knowing how to be
there already. Knowing how to be there already is nothing more than the past coming around to
meet you in the future. Sure she knows how to relate to her brother that way she’s always been.
That’s comfortable. It’s uncomfortable to stand in front of an empty canvas. It’s uncomfortable
because you’re at risk. You might make a fool of yourself. You might be conned. You might get
taken advantage of. You don’t like that, visit the surgeon and get a lobotomy.
BETTY
It doesn’t just stop at my brother.
ERHARD
Obviously it doesn’t stop at your brother. Somebody who says “I hate, I hate, I hate”—that is
“disgruntled and unhappy” waiting-to-happen. Suppose she doesn’t have this as a way to start
every morning? Suppose she doesn’t have that as a way to walk into work? She’ll have to create
a way to walk into work, and create a way to walk into her relationships with her family, and
create a way to walk into relationships with men in her life—instead of being sour to start with
before anything happens.
BETTY
I stay sour constantly.
referentiality, a frame of reference for our understanding—a
“towards-which” for all of our/its dealings in the world. And the
primary towards-which, says Heidegger, is always the “for-the-
sake-of-which” that Dasein itself is: “the ‘for-the-sake-of’ always
pertains to the Being of Dasein, for which, in its Being, that very
Being is essentially an issue” (BT 116–117). My concerns and my
T
actions always circle back to my own Being, always defined by
the in-order-to: “In so far as Dasein exists factically, it understands
itself in the way its ‘for-the-sake-of-itself’ is thus connected with
some current ‘in-order-to’” (BT 416).
T
One of The Forum’s central purposes is the unconcealment
of the in-order-to, which is the design function of the “it”—the
calculative thinking which characterizes the technological clear-
ing. Erhard has pointed out that recognizing his own thrownness
to in-order-to was central in the development of his thinking.
During his 1971 experience of ontological insight, from which the
est Training was generated, he says:
t
“
I realized that I actually didn’t know anything. Ev-
erything that I knew had a tag on it, and the name
of the tag was “in order to.” So I knew this in order
to, I knew that in order to, et cetera. Everything
t
was somehow a part of a story about how it was
going to advance me or how it could be used, or
how it could benefit people, or whatever it might
be. Nothing lived on its own. (Simon  37)
As we will show in the closing Interval for Day Four of The Forum,
the danger of the technological clearing, for Heidegger, is that we
are oblivious to its nature and are thus denied access to the truth
of aletheia: “Through [the technological destining of enframing]
the other possibility is blocked,” said Heidegger, that human
being “might rather be admitted sooner and ever more primally
to the essence of what is unconcealed and to its unconcealment
[aletheia]” (“QCT” in BW 331).

ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day Three: Session One
175
ERHARD
See, look. If she won the Nobel Prize that would be less important to her life than what she just
said. There’s nothing more important for her to say. Because once she can own that, there’s a
possibility beyond that. And until she can own that, there’s no possibility beyond that. All there
is, is shucking and jiving around that: one ploy after another ploy—trying not to be that way, to
fi nding out you are that way, giving in to being that way, making up your mind to be some other
way, trying not to be that way, fi xing being that way—it’s all a trap like having your foot nailed
to the fl oor and running around real fast.
BETTY
I’m going to fi x it.
KIPP
What do you mean by that? Because it’s going to be misheard.
BETTY
I’m going to fi x it by acknowledging my racket. When my racket goes to swing I’m going to
stop it. Because I’m not going to allow myself to pay the costs, just for me to be right and make
everyone wrong. Feel what I’m feeling. I’m going to take full control of it.
ERHARD
Most of that’s pretty good. A little “fi x it” in there; a little “stop it” in there. Most of it is
responsibility for it. And to the degree that she can be responsible for it, to the degree she can
be with it—be with it and be responsible for it—these words are synonymous, by the way—to the
degree that she can be responsible for it, to that degree she’s not limited to it. It’s not going to
go away. That’s who she is. That’s the identity she’s built for herself. It’s gonna be there forever.
And to the degree she can be with that, there’s a possibility beyond that. We’re too far into today
now, so I’m going to stop talking like that.
KIPP
What you’re present to is the distinction sharing. There’s no manipulation, no in-order-to.
That’s what sharing sounds like. This is what The Forum is about. So if you’re sitting in your
chair, if you’re with whatever’s happening in her life with yours, if there’s a harmony, if it
strikes a chord, then you should know that’s what this work is about. If you fi nd yourself in her
speaking—if you fi nd yourself in your life in her life—that’s what we’re doing here. Out of her
generosity—the truth is, out of her getting off  it—that’s what it sounds like when someone’s
getting off  it. She had no life. What she had was hate and resentment and bitterness, and
hate and resentment and bitterness were winning. We’re going to continue to distinguish this
distinction “sharing.”
SUSAN
I didn’t think you’d call on me.
Similarly, for Erhard, it is the in-order-to of the technological
clearing which diminishes our experience of truth:
“
. . .if you take something which is true and add
to it an “in order to” or even a “because” or
a “therefore,” you’ve changed it. And you’ve
changed it so dramatically that it’s no longer the
truth. It’s the truth used for something—to prove
d
something, to coerce others, to be right or make
someone else wrong. The truth used like that isn’t
the truth any more. It’s closer to a lie—something
pretending to be the truth. (Simon, ibid. 38, em-
phasis added)
Here we find ourselves in another instance of the reflexive thinking
that characterizes the work of both Erhard and Heidegger: even
attempts to escape in-order-to are undertaken in order to escape
in-order-to. Consequently, much of The Forum is devoted to the
distinction of a possibility beyond in-order-to. As Forum leader
Roger Armstrong told the Openings participants during this 1989
Forum, “To do one thing that’s not in-order-to” could be worth the
entire four days of The Forum. The paradox—embedded deeply in
Heidegger’s central distinction, appropriation—is that one can get
beyond in-order-to only by allowing and owning the inevitability of
in-order-to. ■

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
That’s what you get for thinking.
SUSAN
Well I called my husband last night, and he’s the one I thought had forced me to do it.
KIPP
Let’s get a little more rigorous. You had the thought...
SUSAN
Right. We were recently married in October. He participated in The Forum a couple of months
ago. When he came back from it he was so excited and he was great. He was excited about
our relationship—which was wonderful. But what really bothered me was that he said it was
because of The Forum. And that bugged me. My husband told me the reason he married me
was because of The Forum. That is a bunch of garbage; “You married me because you love me,
and there’s nobody who is making you marry me.” I went to Forum Introductory meetings and
didn’t like it because they wanted to work on me.
KIPP
No, you didn’t like it because you’re a creep.
SUSAN
Right. Yesterday I was sitting in here, and all these people have these major problems. I don’t
see a major problem in my life. And then I said, “my gosh, that’s one right there.”
KIPP (to the group)
That’s big. Some of you haven’t gotten here yet. Slow group.
SUSAN
As I developed it in my mind, I realized I got to share this, and so I put my hand up. “Now what
if he calls on me? I have to make sure I got this all planned out to say it right.” Then I realized:
I’m terrifi ed.
KIPP
That’s the point. The rest was fi ll. Keep going, please.
SUSAN
The thing that I came into The Forum to accomplish was to have the ability to fi nd the right
position. I just moved up here, and I don’t have a job yet. I wanted to wait until after the
holidays...
KIPP
Wait. What’s true is you don’t have a job yet.
Forum Day Three: Session One
177
SUSAN
That’s right. I’m afraid I’m not going to fi nd the right position. I told him about my racket, that
“I’m right only when it matters to you that you’re right. It doesn’t matter if either way is okay.
But if you’re adamant about being right, then I want to be right.”
KIPP
It’s called new love. It’s a new marriage.
SUSAN
Anyway. Very diffi  cult for me.
KIPP
But that’s the important part. How diffi  cult it is. Everything that you call yourself is going to
fi ght against it. Every justifi cation in the world is going to be there to shut up.
SUSAN
I was afraid that I would lose footing.
KIPP
That’s right. Marriage isn’t about loving, about being at risk: it’s about dominating and winning.
SUSAN
I thought I didn’t want to dominate. I just didn’t want to be dominated.
ERHARD (entering the conversation)
Thanks for this Susan. Very useful conversation. Dominating and avoiding domination are two
sides of the same mirror. It doesn’t mean be a patsy either. There’s an alternative to dominating and
avoiding domination. There’s a possibility beyond that. And it’s not possible to see that until you
see what it costs you to dominate or avoid domination. Most marriages are about dominating and
avoiding domination. They’re about being right and avoiding being wrong. That’s what marriages
are really about. They’re not about the stuff  they put in the fairy tales. And they’re always going to
be about that because you and I didn’t make that up, we inherited that when we became human
beings. And it’s only to the degree that you can own that, for there to be a possibility beyond that.
What you’re doing now, looking at that and owning that, taking it on and seeing that that’s what
owns your marriage: that starts to create the possibility of some power in the marriage.
(pausing)
The other thing is, you want to be able to get to the point where you can be with what people
say. Otherwise you’re going to be manipulated by what people say. See, whatever your husband
said about The Forum: stupid. But you couldn’t be with it; it took your being away from you.
SUSAN
He used a lot of the terminology that you used, and that drove me nuts because he acted kind of
smug. You know he had found “it.” I hadn’t, so I had to go get “it.”
“
There’s an alternative to dominating and
avoiding domination. There’s a possibility
beyond that. And it’s not possible to see
that until you see what it costs you to
dominate or avoid domination.
178
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Yes. That’s the smell of enlightenment. You want to keep your enlightenment to yourself and
not let the smell out. What you want to share with people is empowerment, not enlightenment.
You want to watch doing enlightenment with people, and it’s possible to empower people.
If someone says something stupid to you—I’m not telling you how to handle this, I’m just
illustrating that there’s a way to be with it—if somebody says something stupid to you, you can
say, “okay, I understand exactly what you’re saying.” That gives you much more of an opening
than “that’s stupid.” I don’t talk like this outside of here. I don’t use all this jargon outside of
here. I use it in here because there’s a reason to. Now, you’re going to be stupid. You’re going
to use all the terminology inappropriately. And there’s not much you can do about it. It’s hard
not to. If we could take it back before you left here, we would, so you would just be left with
yourself. All this stuff  in here is not signifi cant. The only thing signifi cant is you. And you can
work your way through those things with your husband now that you’re hip to what’s going
on. It’s a pretty exciting thing to think about the possibility of marriage beyond the games in
marriages.
KIPP
So in sharing with your husband last night, you said?
SUSAN
I said “I’m sorry I was such a twit about signing up.”
ERHARD
A twit?
SUSAN
It’s softer language for me.
ERHARD
You cleaned it up for television.
KIPP
And he said?
SUSAN
He said “That’s all right, I love you.”
KIPP
And what was left? What were you then standing in?
SUSAN
Standing in my own decision.
“
If we could take it back before you left
here, we would, so you would just be left
with yourself. All this stuff  in here is not
significant. The only thing significant
is you.
Forum Day Three: Session One
179
ERHARD
And standing in the love that was there. Not a bad place to stand—talking about power. What
you call love is not love: it’s love in-order-to; love to keep somebody around; or love to get
something out of them; love because you need. That’s not love. When you take everything
else away, what is left is love. When you take away “I was a twit,” and take away him being
arrogant, what you’re left with is love for each other. And it doesn’t mean anything, but it’s
extraordinarily powerful. And you can stand there and really make something happen in life—
like really create something worth creating. Fabulous.
SUSAN
During dinner last night I was expressing things that had bothered me before, and he said, “I
think it should be a requirement for spouses, that when one takes it the other should take
The Forum.”
ERHARD
We like it to get bad fi rst, though. Makes it clearer about what you’re up to if it gets bad fi rst.
SUSAN
I know because listening to everybody else yesterday, things they wanted to fi x, and I didn’t
think I had anything--I just haven’t lived long enough.
ERHARD
You know, we do this with children. They’re as fucked up as you are. They’ve got all the same
stuff  as you going on and they’re in the process of building their identity. And I’m probably one
of the few people in the world who’s an expert on teenagers. And I know almost nothing about
teenagers. The truth about teenagers is that they’re human. People are insulted when I say that.
But when you live with a teenager, you’re not sure.
(laughter)
The truth is that teenagers are adults. That’s hard to get, because they’re a weird kind of adult.
They’re adults who don’t have their act together well enough to get it bought all the time. And
it’s very painful to get called on your act. Very painful. Adults are teenagers with their act so
well put together that they almost never get called on it. Very simple and very powerful.
SUSAN
I see that as I was looking for a job I was afraid of telling my husband for fear he might make
me continue if it didn’t work out.
KIPP
Yeah, don’t establish a network of support for yourself.
SUSAN
He might force me: “Just in case it doesn’t feel good you can jump right out.”
180
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Susan brought up something important about living in fear all the time. The truth you’re going
to fi nd out today is that you live in fear all the time. It’s so pervasive that for you it’s become
ordinary. So it’s only when you’re overwhelmed by fear that you notice that you’re frightened.
But the fear is there all the time: “afraid I might get stuck with this”; “afraid I might get boxed
in.” It’s there all the time. This is an experiment to see what it looks like to live in fear and don’t
call it that. Call it “everyday living.” The more forceful you are, the more frightened you are.
You’re just overcompensating for the fear, so to speak. Why do you suppose it takes courage?
The more frightened you are the more courage you need. The more forceful you are the more
frightened you are.
SUSAN
I’m not really sure. I keep being confused. My natural tendency is to want to fi x it.
ERHARD
No, it’s not your natural tendency; it’s its natural tendency.
SUSAN
Its natural tendency. I keep looking for something.
ERHARD
Right, to try to fi x it. And whatever you try to fi x gets permanent-ized.
SUSAN
I can’t wait to be able to share equally with my husband.
ERHARD
Well done. Just one point about not sharing in-order-to. Sharing attracts. Looking good ensnares,
and sharing attracts. You don’t build relationships talking about what you think. You build
relationships by speaking yourself, and listening self; listening for the self there, not listening
for the story there. If you listen for self, people will speak their selves. If you listen for crap, people
will tell you their crap. If you listen for self, people will tell you their crap fi rst, but they’ll get
around to speaking themselves.
A young man named Andy, wearing a sweatshirt with the logo “Youth at Risk” (a project of Werner
Erhard and Associates), rose.
ANDY
I am a lowdown mother-fucking sleeze.
ERHARD
What do you have to do with Youth at Risk?
ANDY
I work there.
“
is that you live in fear all the time. It’s
so pervasive that for you it’s become
ordinary.
Forum Day Three: Session One
181
ERHARD (to the group)
You’ve got to have advanced training to know that about yourself.
ANDY
My life’s been about being a sleaze. The question was “what do you care most about in life?”
and I said “I care about making a diff erence with people.” And I see that isn’t it. I care about
making a diff erence with young people and I could give a fuck about adults. And my actions
show that. So who I am with an adult is a snake in the grass.
ERHARD
That’s pretty popular. I’m for this and the hell with everything else. That doesn’t give you any
power with what you’re for.
ANDY (replaying a conversation he had)
So she said, “what do you get out of that?” I said, “well, I get to look good. Mr. morality. Mr.
right. Look like I’m honest—all the good stuff  that goes along with it. It was all fun and games
at fi rst.” “What’s the cost?” “I don’t see no cost. Maybe self-expression. Tell people what I’m
really thinking because I’m being manipulative.” “Well what about love?” “I could give a fuck
about love: I’ve got my family. I got all the love I need.” And then she said, “how could you do
what you do? You fucking hurt people, you use people, you lie. How would you feel if someone
was doing that to you all the time? And that’s all you’re doing.” And it does hurt. It hurts deep
inside. I was denying it.
KIPP (moving closer to Andy)
You were doing what you’ve done your entire life.
ANDY
I’m not denying it anymore. I am a sleaze.
KIPP
Being a sleaze is a nice handy phrase that doesn’t let you be present to what’s there in your life.
ANDY
I don’t trust adults.
KIPP
That’s a concept. “I don’t trust adults” is saying information about it.
(clapping his hands)
That sound is present. What’s present when you’re with adults?
ANDY
I don’t know.

صحبت
وجود
روز سوم
روز سوم این مجمع از ساعت 9 صبح آغاز شد و رهبر انجمن ، کیپ ، روی سکو پرسید
شرکت کنندگان برای به اشتراک گذاشتن در مورد تکالیف عصر گذشته: برای به اشتراک گذاشتن تجربه خود
انجمن با کسی در زندگی آنها. کله
وقتی در مورد آنچه اتفاق افتاده صحبت می کنید ، مردم مانده اند ، و شما با هر توصیف باقی مانده اید
به شما می دهد ما می خواهیم آن دامنه صحبت کردن را "در غرفه ها" بنامیم. آیا صحبت با
شخص در کنار ما در مورد آنچه در دادگاه تأثیر می گذارد بر بازی تأثیر می گذارد؟ حالا من از شما می خواهم که دریافت کنید
در دادگاه و سهم از حضور در دادگاه. در اینجا چگونه شروع می شود: "با چه کسی بودید؟"
"شما گفتید چه؟" "آنها چه گفتند؟"
Erhard با پوشیدن یک ژاکت خاکستری تیره با پیراهن های سیاه ، در پشت اتاق ظاهر شد
تماشای تعامل. بیزاری
من دیشب با برادرم تماس گرفتم و به او گفتم ، در آغاز او آزار و اذیت من را برای ساختن
تصمیم به اینجا بودن ، که من از آن مطمئن نیستم ... که او را سرزنش کردم ... کیپ
گفتی او را سرزنش کردی؟ بیزاری
گفتم او را سرزنش کردم. این مکالمه ای است که ما داشتیم. "من تو را به خاطر من در اینجا سرزنش کردم
از آنجا که من نمی خواستم اینجا باشم. این تقصیر شماست و من از شما برای آن متنفرم. "
kipp (به گروه)
شما در آنجا با او هستید زیرا او در مورد اشتراک گذاری صحبت نمی کند ، او به اشتراک می گذارد. حق با شماست
آنجا با تلفن با او. پس به او چه گفتی؟ بیزاری
من به او گفتم که از اینکه چه احساسی دارم ، متاسفم که حق ندارم اینگونه احساس کنم ، که من یکی بودم
چه کسی اشتباه بود و Selfi. کله
و او گفت؟ بیزاری
او گفت که او مرا دوست دارد ، و دلیل اینکه او در اینجا می خواست این است که به این دلیل باشد
خوب برای من و من به او گفتم که نمی خواهم آن را از دیدگاه او ببینم. برای دیدن آن از من
دیدگاه ، و من به من رسید که دیروز از آن استفاده کردم تا این موضوع را درک کنم. من از آن نقطه عبور کردم. فهمیدم من اینجا هستم برای من عالی است و من به او گفتم که از او بخاطر ساخت آن قدردانی کردم
تصمیم برای آزار و اذیت من. روز اول انجمن

وجود
کله
این که آیا این شما را قانع می کند یا شما را آزار می دهد ، و هرگز اتفاق نیفتاده است. به معنای چه چیزی
اتفاق افتاد ، برادرت با شما صحبت کرد. بیزاری
به یک معنا این کار را نکرد و به معنای دیگری انجام داد. کله
توصیف آن است. او با شما صحبت کرد. (به گروه)
آنچه او فقط با شما به اشتراک گذاشته است ، هرگز بعد از دو روز از زندگی شما اتفاق نمی افتد. این یک وضعیت جدید نیست ؛ با این حال ، این سالها بین او و برادرش و دو نفر است
روزها حضور در آن دشوار است ؛ دیدن آن دشوار است زیرا به نظر می رسد دو سال است. بیزاری
من دو روز اولین بار از اینجا متنفرم. کله
نه شما این کار را نکردید ... شما آن افکار را داشتید. آیا ارتباطی با هر یک از آنها داشتید؟
افکار؟ بیزاری
شماره کیپ
نه. مثل باران بود. بیزاری
مثل باران بود. کله
شناسایی با باران را متوقف کنید. erhard (ورود به مکالمه)
او یک نکته بسیار متفاوت را بیان می کند ، و این برای همه مفید خواهد بود. این نیست
شما فکر می کنید چیزهایی که در سر شما در جریان است ، مال شما نیست. متعلق به شما نیست. شما این کار را نکردید
آن را اختراع کنید ، یا آن را تولید کنید. این افکاری است که شما دارید. من می خواهم شما بتوانید فکر کنید که چه چیزی است
ادامه می یابد وقتی فکر می کنید فکر نمی کنید. شما فکر می کنید فکر می کند من دارم
افکاری که فکر می کند در کتاب ، مردی که همسر خود را به خاطر کلاه اشتباه گرفت - چنین بود
یک مرد - او در واقع فکر می کرد که همسرش کلاه است. و شما آن را اشتباه می کنید که فکر می کنید برای فکر کردن. شما شخصاً نیستید مردم اشتباه می کنند که فکر می کنند آنها درست مثل مردی که اشتباه می کند فکر می کنند
همسرش برای کلاه. برای به دست آوردن آن باید برخی از تفکرات را انجام دهید. فکر می کند ، و شما افکار دارید
که فکر می کند شما می خواهید جلوی اینقدر درگیر تفکر خود باشید. شما می خواهید بتوانید
در سفارش
در اینجا Erhard در حال پاکسازی فعلی برای بودن است
محاسبه - به عنوان تکنولوژیکی - در جایی که همه چیز در آن قرار می گیرد
رزرو ، ایستاده ، آماده برای استفاده - همه چیز از جمله ما
خود (لطفاً در طول این مجموعه از نوارهای جانبی در مورد فناوری را ببینید
جلسه سوم و آخر روز چهارم). از آنجا که ما تشخیص نداده ایم
پاکسازی تکنولوژیکی به عنوان یک الگوی ، یک روش خاص برای بودن
که ما فرستاده شده ایم ، ما آن را به سادگی راه چیزها می بینیم -
از جمله خودمان - هستند. در مرتبه ایستاده ، نه

کمی عقب بایستید و فکر کنید. شما فکر می کنید محدود به آنچه فکر می کند محدود شده اید. اما این است
فکر کردن این فکر کرده است که شما به درد زیادی و دردناک ، ناراحتی و نارضایتی فکر کرده است. و مانند یک دستگاه یک هدف دارد. در سفارش طراحی شده است. به ترتیب طراحی نشده است
برای ترک شما با عشق ، تحقق و بیان کامل. آیا شما ایده ای دارید که چیست؟
در سفارش طراحی شده است؟ این طراحی شده است تا شما را خوب جلوه دهد. این عملکرد طراحی آن است. (در راهرو در بین گروه)
و از تفکر و احساس ، تفسیرها ، آنچه شما به نظر شما درست است ، استفاده می کند تا درست شود
خوب به نظر می آیی از آن عناصر استفاده و سازماندهی می کند و آن عناصر را به صورت شکل تولید می کند
طراحی شده است تا شما را خوب جلوه دهد. به نظر می رسد خوب به نظر برسد؟ خوب ، خاص ، به معنای آن است
برای اینکه شما را به درستی و دیگران اشتباه کند ، تسلط بر تسلط خود و جلوگیری از سلطه
از هر چیز دیگری و از تفکر و احساسات شما ، و درک شما و شما استفاده می کند
تفسیرها ، نتیجه گیری ها و غیره برای توجیه خود ؛ به جز خودت و یکی شده است. شما با آن شناسایی کرده اید. شما آن هستید ؛ شما هر کسی هستید چه چیزی شما را به هر کسی تبدیل می کند
آیا شما با آن شناسایی می کنید؟ شما با تفکر و احساس آن شناسایی می کنید ، و این باعث می شود
هر کسی و هزینه ها عشق ، خوشبختی و خود بیان است. فکر می کند و شما آن را دارید
افکار ، و فکر می کند تا شما را خوب جلوه دهد ، و چه چیزی را برای شما برای شناسایی با آن هزینه می کند
عشق ، خوشبختی ، نشاط و بیان خود است. بیزاری
من فکر می کنم چیزی که به من قوی ترین ضربه را به من زد ، راکت بود. وقتی می توانم راکت خود را شناسایی کنم و
دلیل من برای اجازه دادن به امور در زندگی من و دریافت هزینه ای که از آن دریافت کردم ،
شناسایی شناسایی سد همه اینها بود. احساس کردم این تن آجر
از شانه های من برداشته شد و قادر به تصدیق آن بود. و من می دانم که چه کاری انجام می دادم ... erhard
ببینید - اینطور فکر نمی کند آنچه او صحبت می کند هیچ ارتباطی با آن ندارد
خوب به نظر می رسد ، این کار را می کند؟ در واقع اگر واقعاً نگران خوب به نظر می رسیدید
هرگز آنچه را که او فقط گفت. شما نمی توانید آنچه را که او فقط بدون فکر کردن گفت ، بگویید ، زیرا این
ممکن است شما را بد جلوه دهد. ادامه بیزاری
فهمیدم هزینه ای که برای راکت مورد نظر خود می پردازم. درز
دویدن شما یک راکت را اجرا می کنید. بیزاری
راکت که در حال اجرا بودم. در اجازه دادن به خودم برای پذیرش استفاده می شود. درز
من و کیپ ممکن است مجبور شویم به خانه برویم و به او اجازه دهیم این کار را انجام دهد. این فوق العاده قدرتمند است
تشخیص دهید که زندگی شما متعلق به شما نیست. که از زندگی شما برای اهداف خود استفاده می کند. و آن
با "آن" که ما ارسال شده است ، "ما" می شود.
"سیستم سایبرنتیک غول پیکر" ، برای استفاده از عبارت Hubert Dreyfus ،
از این طریق در حال حرکت است: "ما پاکسازی را تولید نمی کنیم. پاکسازی ما را تولید می کند" ("به دست آوردن یک رابطه رایگان با
فناوری ، "کنفرانس هایدگر کاربردی). ما هم به" آن "تبدیل شده ایم که به صورت نظم عمل می کند ، و به عنوان
آنها-خود/هویت ، یکی از آن نهادهایی که مشمول آن است
در سفارش "آن". Erhard نتیجه این را خلاصه کرده است
سیستم:
"
وقتی تو هستی که هویت "من" هستی
تو هستی که هستی - و زن و شوهر
با آنچه که "آن" است ، شما بسیار قدرتمند می شوید
به این موضوع نگاه کنید
به روش روزمره ما در جهان ،
به تعامل روزمره ما با روزمره ما
نگرانی ها یک بار به چه "آن" مربوط می شود
تو هستی که هستی بشر بشر آنچه "آن" است
درست کردن شما بشر بشر و ساختن هر چیز دیگری توسط
تضاد اشتباه ("قلب موضوع")
در وجود و زمان ، در سفارش نیز توسط هایدگر نشان داده شده است
به عنوان یک عنصر اصلی ساختار وجودی Dasein. همانطور که ما
در جای دیگر نشان داده شده است ، داسین همیشه به گونه ای در جهان است
که نگران چیزهاست - تولید آنها ، تولید
د
آنها ، آنها را در نظر می گیرند ، و آنها را در نظر می گیرند (BT 83-84 ،
حرف
96) - و درک ما از جهان از طریق واسطه می شود
این نگرانی ها (در جلسه چهارم به "نگرانی" نوار کناری مراجعه کنید
روز اول) هایدگر چیزهایی را که از این طریق با آنها روبرو می شویم تماس می گیرد
تجهیزات ، و در سفارش ، ویژگی تجهیزات است:
"
تجهیزات در اصل-چیزی در سفارش است-
به بشر بشر کلیت تجهیزات تشکیل شده است
با روشهای مختلف "در سفارش" ، از این دست
به عنوان سرویس دهی ، تسلط ، قابلیت استفاده ،
قابلیت دستکاری [ بشر .] معاملات با تجهیزات
خود را به مانیفولد تابع می کنند
تکالیف "در سفارش". (BT 97 ، 98)
حرف
174
وجود
اهداف خوب به نظر می رسند-همه چیز در صفحه به طور خاص و کاملاً مناسب است-این همان چیزی است که به نظر می رسد
به نظر می رسد: درست بودن ، ساختن افراد دیگر و چیزهای دیگر اشتباه ، مسلط ، اجتناب
سلطه ، توجیه خود و بی اعتبار کردن دیگران و چیزهای دیگر. وقتی به دیدن
این همان چیزی است که زندگی شما برای آن مورد استفاده قرار می گیرد ، شما تقریباً به منبع خود خود نزدیک شده اید. شما تقریباً به منبع هویت خود نزدیک شده اید. تقریباً نزدیک به منبع آن
که خودتان را گیج کرده اید. ادامه بیزاری
او درست بود که من به خودم اجازه می دهم برای پذیرش استفاده شود. این هزینه ای بود که من پرداخت می کردم. من از هزینه ای که دریافت می کردم لذت نبردم. من آنها را اشتباه کردم که درست وقتی کسی بودم که کسی بودم
اشتباه بود کله
حتی اگر او از هزینه ای که دریافت می کرد لذت نمی برد ، آشنا بود. و آنچه شما تماس می گیرید
راحت همان چیزی است که آشنا است ، آنچه شما به آن عادت کرده اید. او اکنون نمی داند چگونه با او ارتباط برقرار کند
برادر. او می داند که چگونه با او ارتباط برقرار کند: اشتباه کنید. اما اکنون او باید در
وجود خطر ... erhard
او باید با برادرش رابطه برقرار کند. این "اختراع" نامیده می شود. او باید اختراع کند
رابطه با برادرش. کلمه دیگر برای آن "ایجاد" است: با او رابطه ایجاد کنید
برادر. شما می خواهید در مورد آن کمی فکر کنید: امکان زندگی زندگی به عنوان یک عمل خلاق ،
جایی که در مقابل بوم ایستاده اید ، پاسخی ندارید. آنچه شما دارید یک است
بوم خالی ، امکان. شما چیزی را در فضای خالی ایجاد نمی کنید که نمی دانید چگونه باشید
در حال حاضر دانستن اینکه چگونه در آنجا حضور داشته باشید چیزی بیش از گذشته نیست
در آینده با شما ملاقات کنید. مطمئناً او می داند که چگونه با برادرش به این ترتیب ارتباط برقرار کند. راحت است ایستادن در مقابل یک بوم خالی ناراحت کننده است. ناراحت کننده است
زیرا شما در معرض خطر هستید. ممکن است خود را احمق کنید. شما ممکن است به هم وصل شوید. ممکن است دریافت کنید
از آن استفاده کرد. شما آن را دوست ندارید ، به جراح مراجعه کرده و یک لوبوتومی دریافت کنید. بیزاری
این فقط به برادرم متوقف نمی شود. درز
بدیهی است که این به برادر شما متوقف نمی شود. کسی که می گوید "من متنفرم ، متنفرم ، متنفرم"
انتظار "ناراضی و ناراضی". فرض کنید او این را به عنوان راهی برای شروع ندارد
هر روز صبح؟ فرض کنید او این کار را به عنوان راهی برای راه رفتن در کار ندارد؟ او باید ایجاد کند
راهی برای پیاده روی در کار ، و ایجاد راهی برای قدم زدن در روابط خود با خانواده و
راهی برای قدم زدن در روابط با مردان در زندگی خود ایجاد کنید
قبل از هر اتفاقی بیزاری
من دائماً ترش می مانم. مرجع ، یک چارچوب مرجع برای درک ما -
"به سمت" که برای همه معاملات ما در جهان است. و
هایدگر می گوید:
به خاطر این که خود داسین است: "" همیشه "
مربوط به وجود Dasein است ، که در وجود آن ، آن را بسیار
وجود در واقع یک مسئله است "(BT 116–117). نگرانی های من و من
حرف
اقدامات همیشه به وجود خودم باز می گردد ، همیشه توسط تعریف می شود
در سفارش: "تا آنجا که Dasein به طور واقعی وجود دارد ، آن را درک می کند
از این رو خود به روشی که "برای خود-از خود" در ارتباط است
برخی از "سفارشات" فعلی "(BT 416). حرف
یکی از اهداف اصلی این انجمن عدم پذیرش است
از درون سفارش ، که عملکرد طراحی "آن" است-
تفکر محاسبه کننده که مشخصه فن آوری است-
در ارهارد خاطرنشان کرده است که شناخت پرتاب خودش
به ترتیب در جهت توسعه تفکر او مهم بود. در طول تجربه خود در سال 1971 از بینش هستی شناختی ، که از آن
او می گوید آموزش EST ایجاد شد:
حرف
"
فهمیدم که واقعاً چیزی نمی دانم. با
از آنجا که می دانستم برچسب روی آن و نام آن است
برچسب "به منظور" بود. بنابراین من این را به ترتیب می دانستم
به ، من می دانستم که به منظور ، و cetera. همه چیز
حرف
به نوعی بخشی از داستانی در مورد چگونگی آن بود
رفتن به پیشبرد من یا نحوه استفاده از آن ، یا
چگونه می تواند به نفع مردم یا هر آنچه که ممکن است به نفع باشد
باشد هیچ چیز به تنهایی زندگی نمی کرد. (سیمون 37)
همانطور که در فاصله پایانی برای روز چهارم انجمن نشان خواهیم داد ،
خطر پاکسازی تکنولوژیکی ، برای هایدگر ، این است که ما
از ماهیت خود غافل هستند و از این رو از دسترسی به حقیقت محروم می شوند
از Aletheia: "از طریق [سرنوشت فن آوری Enframing]
احتمال دیگر مسدود شده است ، "گفت هایدگر ، آن انسان
"ممکن است ترجیحاً زودتر پذیرفته شود
به ذات آنچه که غیرقانونی است و به عدم هماهنگی آن
[Aletheia] "(" QCT "در BW 331). W

ببینید ، نگاه کنید. اگر او جایزه نوبل را کسب کرد که برای زندگی او کمتر از آنچه او فقط خواهد بود
گفت هیچ چیز مهمتر برای گفتن او وجود ندارد. از آنجا که هنگامی که او می تواند مالک آن باشد ، وجود دارد
امکان فراتر از آن و تا زمانی که او نتواند آن را داشته باشد ، هیچ امکان فراتر از آن وجود ندارد. همه آنجا
است ، در حال لرزیدن و جیب زدن در اطراف آن است: یکی از آنها پس از یک دلخور دیگر - سعی می کند به این صورت نباشد.
از این رو شما چنین هستید ، به این روش تسلیم می شوید ، ذهن خود را به وجود می آورید تا دیگری باشید
راه ، سعی در اینگونه نیست ، فینگ به این ترتیب است - این همه تله ای مانند میخ زدن پای شما است
به فلا و سریع در حال اجرا است. بیزاری
من می خواهم آن را به عنوان fi x. کله
منظورت از آن چیست؟ زیرا این مورد سوء استفاده خواهد شد. بیزاری
من می خواهم با تصدیق راکت خود ، آن را از بین ببرم. وقتی راکت من به نوسان می رود ، من قصد دارم
جلوی آن را بگیرید. از آنجا که من نمی خواهم به خودم اجازه دهم هزینه ها را بپردازم ، فقط برای اینکه من درست باشم و درست کنم
همه اشتباه می کنند آنچه را که احساس می کنم احساس کنید. من قصد دارم کنترل کامل آن را داشته باشم. درز
بیشتر اینها بسیار خوب است کمی "fi x it" در آنجا ؛ کمی "آن را متوقف کنید" در آنجا. بیشتر آن است
مسئولیت آن و تا حدی که او می تواند مسئولیت آن را داشته باشد ، تا حدی که می تواند
با آن باشید - با آن باشید و مسئول آن باشید - این کلمات مترادف هستند ، به هر حال -
مدرکی که او می تواند مسئول آن باشد ، تا حدودی محدود به آن نیست. قرار نیست
برو دور این او کیست این هویتی است که او برای خودش ساخته است. این برای همیشه در آنجا خواهد بود. و تا حدی که او می تواند با آن باشد ، فراتر از آن امکان وجود دارد. ما امروز خیلی دور هستیم
اکنون ، بنابراین من می خواهم اینطور صحبت کنم. کله
آنچه شما در آن حضور دارید ، تقسیم تمایز است. هیچ دستکاری ، بدون سفارش وجود ندارد. این به نظر می رسد که اشتراک گذاری است. این همان چیزی است که انجمن در مورد آن است. بنابراین اگر در خود نشسته اید
صندلی ، اگر شما با هر اتفاقی که در زندگی او با شما اتفاق می افتد ، اگر هماهنگی وجود داشته باشد ، اگر این کار باشد.
به وتر حمله می کند ، پس باید بدانید که این کار چیست. اگر خودتان را در او قرار دهید
صحبت کردن - اگر خود را در زندگی خود در زندگی خود در زندگی خود قرار دهید - این همان کاری است که ما در اینجا انجام می دهیم. خارج از او
سخاوت - حقیقت این است که از او خارج می شود - این همان چیزی است که وقتی کسی به نظر می رسد
پیاده شدن از آن او زندگی نداشت. آنچه او داشت نفرت و نارضایتی و تلخی بود و
نفرت و نارضایتی و تلخی برنده شد. ما قصد داریم این موضوع را به هم متمایز کنیم
تمایز "اشتراک".
سوزان
من فکر نمی کردم شما با من تماس بگیرید. به همین ترتیب ، برای Erhard ، این یک نظم از فناوری است
پاکسازی که تجربه ما از حقیقت را کاهش می دهد:
"
بشر بشر اگر چیزی را درست کنید و اضافه کنید
به آن "به منظور" یا حتی "زیرا" یا
"بنابراین" ، شما آن را تغییر داده اید. و شما
آن را به طرز چشمگیری تغییر داد که دیگر نیست
حقیقت. این حقیقت است که برای چیزی استفاده می شود - برای اثبات
د
چیزی ، برای مجبور کردن دیگران ، درست بودن یا درست کردن
شخص دیگری اشتباه حقیقت استفاده شده مانند آن نیست
حقیقت دیگر این به دروغ نزدیکتر است - چیزی
تظاهر به حقیقت. (سیمون ، همانجا 38 ، em-
Phasis اضافه شده)
در اینجا ما خودمان را در نمونه دیگری از تفکر بازتابی می بینیم
این کار هر دو Erhard و Heidegger را توصیف می کند: حتی
تلاش برای فرار از سفارش به منظور فرار انجام می شود
در سفارش در نتیجه ، بخش اعظم این انجمن به
تمایز یک امکان فراتر از سفارش. به عنوان رهبر انجمن
راجر آرمسترانگ در این سال 1989 به شرکت کنندگان افتتاحیه گفت
انجمن ، "انجام یک کاری که به ترتیب نیست" می تواند ارزش آن را داشته باشد
کل چهار روز از انجمن. پارادوکس - عمیقاً جاسوسی شده است
تمایز اصلی هایدگر ، تخصیص - این است که می توان دریافت کرد
فراتر از سفارش فقط با اجازه و داشتن اجتناب ناپذیری

کله
این همان چیزی است که شما برای فکر کردن دریافت می کنید. سوزان
خوب من دیشب به شوهرم زنگ زدم ، و او کسی است که فکر کردم مرا مجبور کرده است این کار را انجام دهم. کله
بیایید کمی سختگیرانه تر شویم فکر کردی ... سوزان
درست ما اخیراً در ماه اکتبر ازدواج کردیم. او چند ماه در این انجمن شرکت کرد
پیش وقتی از آن برگشت ، بسیار هیجان زده بود و او عالی بود. او از این هیجان زده بود
رابطه ما - که فوق العاده بود. اما آنچه واقعاً مرا آزار داد این بود که او گفت این است
به دلیل انجمن و این من را اشکال داد. شوهرم به من گفت دلیل ازدواج با من
به خاطر انجمن بود این یک دسته زباله است. "تو با من ازدواج کردی چون مرا دوست داری ،
و کسی نیست که شما را با من ازدواج کند. " من به جلسات مقدماتی به انجمن رفتم و
این را دوست ندارد زیرا آنها می خواستند روی من کار کنند. کله
نه ، شما آن را دوست ندارید زیرا خزش هستید. سوزان
درست دیروز من در اینجا نشسته بودم و همه این افراد این مشکلات اساسی را دارند. من نمی کنم
یک مشکل اساسی در زندگی من را ببینید. و سپس من گفتم ، "خدای من ، این یک حق است."
kipp (به گروه)
این بزرگ است برخی از شما هنوز به اینجا نرسیده اید. گروه آهسته سوزان
همانطور که آن را در ذهنم ایجاد کردم ، فهمیدم که باید این را به اشتراک بگذارم ، و به همین ترتیب دستم را بالا گذاشتم. "حالا چه
اگر او با من تماس می گیرد؟ من باید اطمینان حاصل کنم که من این برنامه را برای گفتن درست برنامه ریزی کرده ام. " سپس متوجه شدم:
من وحشتناک هستم کله
این نکته است بقیه fi ll بود. لطفاً ادامه دهید. سوزان
چیزی که من برای انجام آن وارد انجمن شدم این بود که توانایی حق را داشته باشم
موقعیت من فقط به اینجا رفتم ، و هنوز شغلی ندارم. من می خواستم صبر کنم تا بعد از
تعطیلات ... کیپ
صبر کن واقعیت این است که شما هنوز شغلی ندارید. روز اول انجمن: جلسه یک
177
سوزان
درست است من می ترسم که نمی خواهم موقعیت درستی را بدست آورم. من در مورد راکت خود به او گفتم ،
"من فقط وقتی برای شما مهم است که شما درست است. مهم نیست که به هیچ وجه خوب باشد.
کله
به آن عشق جدید گفته می شود. این یک ازدواج جدید است سوزان
به هر حال فرقه بسیار متفاوتی برای من. کله
اما این بخش مهم است چقدر فرقه متفاوت است. هر چیزی که خودت صدا می کنی قرار است
در برابر آن. هر توجیهی در جهان قرار است در آنجا تعطیل شود. سوزان
می ترسیدم که پای خود را از دست بدهم. کله
درست است ازدواج به معنای دوست داشتن نیست ، در مورد خطر بودن: این در مورد تسلط و پیروزی است. سوزان
فکر کردم نمی خواهم تسلط داشته باشم. من فقط نمی خواستم تسلط پیدا کنم. erhard (ورود به مکالمه)
با تشکر از این سوزان مکالمه بسیار مفید تسلط و اجتناب از سلطه دو است
طرفین آینه. این به معنای پاتسی نیست. جایگزینی برای تسلط و
اجتناب از تسلط فراتر از آن امکان وجود دارد. و دیدن آن تا زمانی که شما امکان پذیر نیست
ببینید که برای تسلط یا جلوگیری از سلطه برای شما چه هزینه دارد. بیشتر ازدواج ها در مورد تسلط و
اجتناب از تسلط آنها در مورد درست بودن و جلوگیری از اشتباه بودن هستند. این همان ازدواج است
واقعاً در مورد آنها مربوط به چیزهایی نیستند که در افسانه ها قرار داده اند. و آنها همیشه به آنجا می روند
در مورد این باشید زیرا من و شما این کار را نکردیم ، ما وقتی انسان شدیم به ارث بردیم
موجودات و این فقط به حدی است که می توانید آن را در اختیار داشته باشید ، زیرا امکان فراتر از آن وجود دارد. آنچه اکنون انجام می دهید ، به آن نگاه می کنید و صاحب آن هستید ، آن را می گیرید و می بینید که این چه چیزی است
صاحب ازدواج شما است: این شروع به ایجاد امکان قدرت در ازدواج می کند. (مکث)
نکته دیگر این است که شما می خواهید بتوانید به جایی برسید که بتوانید با آنچه مردم هستید باشید
بگو در غیر این صورت شما با آنچه مردم می گویند دستکاری می شوید. ببینید ، هر چه شوهرت
در مورد انجمن گفت: احمقانه. اما شما نمی توانید با آن باشید. این وجود شما را از شما دور کرد. سوزان
او از اصطلاحات زیادی که شما استفاده کرده اید استفاده کرد و این باعث شد آجیل من را به وجود آورد زیرا او به نوعی عمل می کرد
قاچاق شما می دانید که او "آن" را پیدا کرده بود. من نبودم ، بنابراین مجبور شدم بروم "آن".
"
جایگزینی برای تسلط و
اجتناب از تسلط یک امکان وجود دارد
فراتر از آن و دیدن آن امکان پذیر نیست
که تا زمانی که ببینید چه هزینه ای برای شما دارد
تسلط داشته باشید یا از سلطه خودداری کنید. 178

درز
بله این بوی روشنگری است. شما می خواهید روشنگری خود را برای خود نگه دارید و
نگذارید بو آنچه می خواهید با مردم به اشتراک بگذارید توانمندسازی است ، نه روشنگری. شما می خواهید به تماشای روشنگری با مردم بپردازید ، و امکان توانمندسازی مردم امکان پذیر است. اگر کسی به شما چیزی احمقانه بگوید - من به شما نمی گویم چگونه این کار را انجام دهید ، من فقط هستم
نشان می دهد که راهی برای همراهی با آن وجود دارد - اگر کسی به شما احمقانه بگوید ، می توانید
بگویید ، "خوب ، من دقیقاً می فهمم که شما چه می گویید." که به شما یک دهانه بیشتر می دهد
از "این احمقانه است." من در خارج از اینجا اینگونه صحبت نمی کنم. من در خارج از این ژارگون استفاده نمی کنم
اینجا من در اینجا از آن استفاده می کنم زیرا دلیلی وجود دارد. اکنون ، شما احمق خواهید بود. شما می روید
برای استفاده از تمام اصطلاحات نامناسب. و کارهای زیادی در مورد آن وجود ندارد. سخت است
نه به اگر می توانستیم قبل از عزیمت به اینجا ، آن را برگردانیم ، می خواهیم ، بنابراین شما فقط با آن باقی می مانند
خودت تمام این مطالب موجود در اینجا قابل توجه نیست. تنها چیزی که قابل توجه نیست شما هستید. و شما می توانید
اکنون که شما با آنچه اتفاق می افتد ، با شوهرتان راه خود را انجام دهید
روی فکر کردن در مورد احتمال ازدواج فراتر از بازی ها در مورد این یک چیز بسیار هیجان انگیز است
ازدواج کله
بنابراین در به اشتراک گذاشتن با شوهرت دیشب ، گفتید؟ سوزان
من گفتم "متاسفم که من در مورد ثبت نام در چنین مواردی بودم."
درز
یک twit؟ سوزان
این برای من زبان نرمتر است. درز
شما آن را برای تلویزیون تمیز کردید. کله
و او گفت؟ سوزان
او گفت: "این خوب است ، من شما را دوست دارم."
کله
و چه چیزی باقی مانده است؟ پس از آن در چه چیزی ایستاده بودید؟ سوزان
در تصمیم خودم ایستاده ام. "
اگر می توانستیم قبل از ترک شما آن را برگردانیم
در اینجا ، ما می خواهیم ، بنابراین شما فقط مانده اید
با خودت همه این مطالب موجود در اینجا نیست
قابل توجه تنها چیزی که قابل توجه است

و ایستاده در عشقی که آنجا بود. مکان بدی برای ایستادن نیست - صحبت کردن در مورد قدرت. چه
شما عشق می نامید عشق نیست: این عشق به ترتیب است. عشق به نگه داشتن کسی یا عشق به گرفتن
چیزی از آنها ؛ عشق چون شما نیاز دارید این عشق نیست وقتی همه چیز را می گیرید
در غیر این صورت ، آنچه باقی مانده عشق است. وقتی شما را دور می کنید "من یک توییت بودم" ، و او را از بین ببرید
متکبر ، آنچه شما با آن مانده اید عشق به یکدیگر است. و این به معنای چیزی نیست ، اما این است
فوق العاده قدرتمند. و می توانید در آنجا بایستید و واقعاً چیزی در زندگی اتفاق می افتد -
مثل اینکه واقعاً چیزی را ایجاد کنید که ارزش ایجاد دارد. افسانه سوزان
در طول شام دیشب من در حال بیان چیزهایی بودم که قبلاً مرا آزار داده بودند و او گفت: "من
فکر کنید که این باید یک الزام برای همسران باشد ، که وقتی کسی آن را می گیرد دیگری باید بگیرد

ما دوست داریم که بد اول بد شود. در صورت بدی که بد شود ، در مورد آنچه که به آن توجه می کنید ، روشن تر می شود. سوزان
من می دانم چون دیروز گوش دادن به همه افراد دیگر ، چیزهایی که آنها می خواستند از آن استفاده کنند ، و من این کار را نکردم
فکر می کنم من چیزی داشتم-من فقط به اندازه کافی زندگی نکرده ام. درز
می دانید ، ما این کار را با کودکان انجام می دهیم. آنها به اندازه شما لعنتی هستند. آنها همه یکسان هستند
چیزهایی که در حال انجام است و آنها در حال ساخت هویت خود هستند. و من احتمالاً یکی هستم
از معدود افراد جهان که متخصص نوجوانان هستند. و من تقریباً هیچ چیز در مورد آن نمی دانم
نوجوانان حقیقت در مورد نوجوانان این است که آنها انسان هستند. وقتی این حرف را می زنم مردم توهین می شوند. اما وقتی با یک نوجوان زندگی می کنید ، مطمئن نیستید. (خنده)
حقیقت این است که نوجوانان بزرگسال هستند. بدست آوردن این کار دشوار است ، زیرا آنها یک نوع بزرگ بزرگسال هستند. آنها بزرگسالانی هستند که عمل خود را به اندازه کافی خوب ندارند تا همیشه آن را خریداری کنند. وت
بسیار دردناک است که از عمل خود فراخوانی کنید. بسیار دردناک بزرگسالان نوجوان با عمل خود هستند
خوب کنار هم قرار دهید که تقریباً هرگز از آن فراخوانی نمی شوند. بسیار ساده و بسیار قدرتمند. سوزان
من می بینم که همانطور که به دنبال شغلی بودم از ترس از ترسیدن به شوهرم می ترسیدم
اگر این کار به نتیجه نرسد ، ادامه می دهم. کله
بله ، شبکه ای از پشتیبانی خود را ایجاد نکنید. سوزان
او ممکن است مرا مجبور کند: "فقط در صورتی که احساس خوبی نداشته باشد می توانید به سمت راست پرش کنید."

سوزان همیشه در مورد زندگی در ترس چیز مهمی به وجود آورد. حقیقتی که می روید
