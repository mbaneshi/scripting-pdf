Forum Day Two: Session One
89
The day began at 9:00 am, with Julie, The Forum Supervisor, leading the participants through the
process of fi lling out the Graduate Records form. Before the forms were collected, she asked the
participants to stop writing, and Kipp mounted the platform (T-shaped, with stairs at the end of the
center runway) and led a conversation about the Six-Day Course.* Following this hour-long conversa-
tion, Wes replaced Kipp on the platform to invite participants to share what they encountered when
doing the assignment given at the end of Day One.
WES
Good morning. Weâ€™re going to begin with sharing. Would someone repeat the three assignments
Werner gave you last night?
MAC (a participant in a wheelchair)
Youâ€™re one of the leaders of this Forum. This program has been going on for seventeen years
with hundreds of thousands of people, which means you have had many hundreds of Forums.
To keep us here to one oâ€™clock means for me that after doing my homework I wasnâ€™t able to
get to bed until a quarter till three. I request that you organize yourselves, as we must organize
ourselves, so that we can leave here by eleven instead of one oâ€™clock.
WES
I got your suggestion.
MAC
But are you going to do anything about it?
WES
The Forum will probably end between eleven and one am.

FORUM DAY TWO:
SESSION ONE
*
NOTE: The Six-Day Course originally was included as part of what was called the Ten-Day
Teen Training, first delivered in June 1973. In addition to the four-day est Training, six days
were devoted to various physical challenges such as riding zip-lines and repelling cliff s.
The Six-Day Course that Kipp discussed here at the beginning of Day Two of The Forum was
first delivered in March 1977 for adult graduates of the est Training, and continued to be de-
livered through the transition to The Forum in 1985, up until June 1991 when the last Six-Day
was held.
Some elements of the course were included (though significantly revised) in what became
the Landmark Advanced Course, first delivered in 1991. This course still (as of 2019) serves as the
second of four parts of Landmarkâ€™s Curriculum for Living, the other two parts of which are
The Landmark Forum in Action ten-session seminar series and The Landmark Self-Expression
and Leadership Program.

SPEAKING BEING
MAC
So youâ€™re not going to do anything about it.
WES
No, weâ€™re not going to follow your suggestion.
MAC
Well at least I got it off  my chest.
WES
Thereâ€™s something at stake here which is much more important than an hour or so of sleep.
MAC
For some of us, sleep is important to function.
WES
Yeah, yeah, itâ€™ll get worse.
(laughter)
Who can repeat the assignments?
(some raising their hands)
Who cannot repeat them?
(others raising their hands)
Now, who can repeat the assignment and share about it?
SIENNA
Share your experience with someone in The Forum. Bring areas to work on, inauthenticities.
And look at areas of your life where looking good uses you.
WES
Look at the possibility that looking good has used your life. Which one do you want to share
about?
SIENNA
I want to share about looking good, and the way I look good goes back to the already always
listening. I have a presence that is an act about knowing, about knowing it all.
WES
Without this distinction you are dealing with, we tend to put our knowledge and our informa-
tion in a box, and we donâ€™t see that we use that box for something, we make the box itself right,
NOTE: See the beginning of Session Three of Day Four,
where Mac comes forward to share what he had gotten out
of the course.
