HARRIET
Yeah. Really carrying it to absurd degrees.
KIPP
Like what?
HARRIET
For example, Thursday, I parked my car, got out of my car: I stepped in shit, literal shit. 
(laughter)
“What does this mean?” And I started thinking that I wasn’t in harmony with the universe, or I 
wouldn’t have stepped in shit. So I wipe it off . 
KIPP (to laughter)
That is so great! You step in shit: You’re out of harmony with the universe...
HARRIET
Ah, but wait! But then yesterday when Werner was talking about stepping in dogshit I thought, 
“Wow! I’m really doing it right.” 
KIPP (to laughter)
Wow! You’re on the leading edge of shit! Nothing could ever just happen! 
HARRIET (laughing)
That’s my life!
KIPP
Stepping in shit and having it be in harmony with the universe. Anything else Harriet?
HARRIET
I choose whatever is in front of me.
KIPP (to laughter)
Or underneath you.
HARRIET
Yup! And I’m still making it real signifi cant.
KIPP
That’s right. It all can be signifi cant as hell.
HARRIET
Right. Yeah.
