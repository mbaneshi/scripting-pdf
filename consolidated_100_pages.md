To the students in my Communication Studies classes at St. Cloud State University, who for the past twenty-five years have been 
my partners in the play and mystery of ontological inquiry; and to my wife Susan Saetre, my constant guardian angel.
BRUCE
To my friend and writing partner, Bruce Hyde (1941-2015), who blazed a trail with his unrelenting commitment to communicate 
the unsaid. What a gift  to have worked with a man of such brilliance, humor, and courage, even unto death, and with this book,
Bruce will continue to speak to each reader willing to take up the call to enter the conversation this book is but a fragment of.
I also dedicate this book to my students, ever my co-experimenters in the inquiry of what it means to be a writer and a reader; 
and to my wife Cindy, and my children, Tristan and Cassidy: I dedicate the fruits of my labor to your future.

ABOUT THE AUTHORS
BRUCE HYDE  (PhD, University of Southern California, 1990) was a Professor of 
Communication Studies at St. Cloud State University until his death on October 
13th, 2015 (1941-2015). His primary interests as an educator were with the 
ontological dimensions of language and communication, and with dialogue as a
non-polarized and non-polarizing form of public discourse.
DREW KOPP  (PhD, University of Arizona, 2009) is an Associate Professor of 
Writing Arts at Rowan University. His research interests focus on the theory and
history of rhetorical pedagogies, and he has published articles in journals in the
field of rhetoric and writing studies, including Rhetoric Review (2013), and
w
JAC:
Rhetoric, Writing, Culture, Politics (2012). He has also contributed a chapter to the
edited collection Disrupting Pedagogies in the Knowledge Society (2011).

Praise for Speaking Being
From the Aft erword:
I regard Speaking Being as an enormously important contribution to understanding 
Heidegger and Erhard. The latter has received far too little serious academic 
attention, and this book begins to make up for that lack. Moreover, the book’s 
analysis of Heidegger’s thought is among the best that I have ever read. I commend
this book to all readers without reservation.
MICHAEL E. ZIMMERMAN, Professor Emeritus, University of Colorado, Boulder
This book is powerful, imaginative, frustrating, amusing, threatening, and 
enlightening—all at the same time. It also has the power to transform your life.
JONATHAN D. MORENO, University of Pennsylvania Professor of Ethics, 
author of Impromptu Man
The profound impact of Werner Erhard’s work on culture and society is a
manifestation of an incredible insight, the experience of being, presented in 
this book through a comparative analysis of a transcript of a 1989 Forum led by 
Erhard alongside Heidegger’s reflections on the meaning of “being there.” The
authors have drawn amazing parallels between these two extraordinary thinkers 
and have demonstrated the intersections of Heidegger’s language with Erhard’s 
ontological rhetoric of transformation. Erhard has at times described aspects of his 
method as ruthless compassion, and like all forms of compassion, evident here is a
fundamental motivating desire to alleviate the suff ering of others. 
JAMES R. DOTY, MD, Founder and Director, The Center for Compassion and Altruism
Research and Education, Professor of Neurosurgery, Stanford University School of 
Medicine, and Senior Editor of  The Oxford Handbook of Compassion Science
Speaking Being is not a book. It is a multimodal tour de force of ontological rhetoric
that hails its reader into an event and in so doing performs as an event, rather 
than what is commonly rendered as a book between two covers. Its status as an 
event is performed on every page wherein the “showing” of Being is enacted via 
its remarkable design. Kaleidoscopically, Bruce Hyde and Drew Kopp have drawn 
their readers into a dazzling display, where the participants in dialogue with Werner 
Erhard in a specific Forum in 1989 are put into dialogue with Martin Heidegger. The 
result is arguably one of the most astounding academic interventions into both 
Erhard’s methodology and Heideggerian thought. Citing David Farrell Krell, Hyde 
and Kopp remind us that “to be on a woodpath means to be in a cul-de-sac, a path
that leads nowhere and has no exit.” Speaking Being puts its readers in a dizzying 
cul-de-sac within which they may never leave, but rather transform into one of the
glittering particles of this rhetorical kaleidoscope. 
CYNTHIA HAYNES, Professor of English, Clemson University, author of  The Homesick 
Phone Book: Addressing Rhetoric in the Age of Perpetual Conflict
Theory and Practice: Ways of seeing what one claims to be the truth of some
intended object of consciousness and ways of applying this truth to one’s 
everyday existence in order to cultivate wisdom, goodness, self-realization, and 
justice. The dialogical teachings of Werner Erhard speak to the importance of this 
relationship and its ontological significance. Professors Hyde and Kopp, scholars 
of rhetoric and communication who had observed and participated in programs 
designed by Erhard, provide comprehensive and detailed conversations—what 
they term “ontological rhetoric”—that took place in Erhard’s 1989 Forum, and they 
demonstrate how Erhard and Heidegger can be read together for the benefit of 
both. This book is a major achievement in the scholarship of Erhard and Heidegger 
studies. A much-needed moment of enlightenment.
MICHAEL J. HYDE, University Distinguished Professor of Communication Ethics, Wake 
Forest University, author of Perfection: Coming to Terms with Being Human
In Speaking Being the reader discovers two original thinkers—Werner Erhard 
and Martin Heidegger—two intellects who independently reached linguistic, 
ontological, and phenomenological philosophies that illuminate each other.

Authors Hyde and Kopp accomplish the formidable task of masterfully presenting 
Erhard and Heidegger side by side in a readable, lively, and illuminating text. There 
is nothing quite like it!
JERONIMA (JERI) ECHEVERRIA, Professor of History and Provost Emerita, California 
State University at Fresno, former Executive Vice-Chancellor for Academic Aff airs of 
the California State University System
Educational research confirms that without a significant intervention, students 
who become teachers are likely to replicate the pedagogical approaches their 
teachers used with them. Practicing Erhard’s approach to ontological inquiry—
presented in print for the first time in this book—provides such an intervention. 
It equips students, teachers, academics of any field to critically examine their 
dispositions and access more eff ective ways of being and acting. Speaking Being is
a must read for scholars of social foundations of education, teacher education, and
frankly, for members of any field of study.
CAROLYNE J. WHITE, Professor of Social Foundations, Department of Urban 
Education, Rutgers University Newark
A diff erent you and a diff erent me must show up each day if we are going to
tackle the world’s most vexing problems. This book talks us through a process of 
transformation by showing us what it means to be an authentic human being in an
inauthentic world, and what it means to take a stand for a world where everyone
matters and where everyone can make a diff erence. 
WILEY “CHIP” SOUBA, MD, SCD, MBA, Professor of Surgery, Geisel School 
of Medicine at Dartmouth, former Dean of Medicine and VP for Health Aff airs,
Dartmouth College
This engaging study of Erhard’s counter-discursive approach to transformational 
education—and how this approach aligns significantly with Heidegger’s thinking—
might serve as a starting point for a deeper Indigenous philosophy. Rooted in a
more non-hierarchical epistemology, such an Indigenous philosophy promises to
move us away from a colonized and deeply problematized way of thinking, toward 
embracing the power and mysteriousness of presence, and making possible a
place-based, non-anthropocentric interconnectedness. This is the next essential 
step we must take if we are to survive as a species.
FOUR ARROWS, AKA DON TRENT JACOBS, PHD, EdD, editor of Unlearning the
Language of Conquest, author of Point of Departure
f
and Teaching Truly

While some readers of Speaking Being may be familiar with The Landmark Forum, 
most don’t know its connections to the philosophical tradition. Hyde and Kopp 
have woven together concise explanations of Heidegger’s notoriously diff icult 
thinking with an actual transcript of Erhard’s Forum—by turns moving, funny, and 
shocking. This juxtaposition draws the reader into the experience and powerfully
illuminates the teachings of these two thinkers.
DAVID STOREY, Associate Professor, Boston College, author of 
Naturalizing Heidegger
Speaking Being presents an ontological play between Erhard, Heidegger, the 
participants of a Forum delivered in 1989, and the reader, who is summoned to 
the scene to dwell in compelling questions and distinctions, the living of which
make available the invention of a life that is experienced as authentic. The
relentless commitment of authors Hyde and Kopp to communicate the unsayable, 
Being, opens up new directions for a rhetoric of emancipation that goes beyond 
traditional critical theories. Speaking Being speaks a new relation to language, one
that honors the unexplored ontological power of language to create a new freedom 
to be, to live with existential courage.

Many academics in cultural studies accept postmodernity and content pedagogy 
as unquestionable facts of the world, but with a paltry understanding of how these 
ideas undermine our intention to produce morally conscious, action-oriented 
citizens. In their lucid exposition of Werner Erhard’s methodology, Hyde and Kopp 
off er a cogent roadmap out of such a paralyzing paradigm of knowledge and 
subjectivity. Brilliantly, the authors use Martin Heidegger’s writing to illuminate
Erhard’s work and The Forum’s compelling impact on participants. Readers will
discover for themselves, based on the contexts they bring, a powerful pedagogy
of transformation grounded in an ontological inquiry into human being that 
leads students to discover their own paths of social agency and initiative. Highly 
recommended!
TRYSTAN T. COTTEN, Associate Professor, Gender Studies, University of California,
Stanislaus, founder and managing editor of Transgress Press
Speaking Being presents, perhaps for the first time, a complete transcript of an 
actual Forum led by Werner Erhard, allowing the reader to directly observe and 
experience the unique power of dialogue as a tool for human transformation. 
Furthermore, authors Hyde and Kopp provide an intellectually satisfying
correlation between the philosophical ideas of Martin Heidegger and the out-here-
in-the-world work of Werner Erhard, revealing their surprising complementarity. I
d
congratulate the authors on achieving this tour de force.

Introduction
1
 Introduction
In 1971, the television debut of All in the Family tickled an American public who
y
was also celebrating the successful moon landing, and safe return home, of two
Apollo space missions. In the same year, much smaller audiences took note of Igor 
Stravinsky’s death and the birth of Calvin Broadus Jr. (aka Snoop Dogg/Lion); a 
marketing phenomenon was born in Seattle with the opening of the first Star-
bucks; Idi Amin ousted Milton Obote to become the dictator of Uganda; and in the
new academic field of composition and rhetoric, a movement to elevate the status 
of process began to stir. Meanwhile, in October of that year in a meeting room of 
San Francisco’s less-than-swank Jack Tar Hotel, Werner Erhard assembled some
two hundred participants for the debut of the est Training. Given this timing for 
the emergence of the est Training, media at the time characterized it as a part of 
t
the human potential movement, but scholar Jonathan Moreno has more recently 
called est “the most important cultural event after the human potential movement
itself seemed exhausted” (Impromptu Man 247).
Infamous for its rigorous ground rules and confrontational methods—
elements Erhard says were necessary in the liberated, let-it-all-hang-out, “new 
age” ethos of the time—the est Training (Latin for
t
it is, and an acronym for Erhard 
Seminars Training) grew in popularity throughout the 1970s because of the im-
pressive benefits participants reported having received, including better relation-
ships and a greater sense of “aliveness.” Trainees experienced being “at cause” 
in the matter of their lives, and having a new sense that their lives could make a
difference in the world. They felt “free to be.” This new sense of responsibility and 
freedom allowed for breakthroughs in communicating with others, and enabled
them to produce results, both personal and professional, that they would previ-
ously have seen as unlikely.
At the source of this educational enterprise was an experience Erhard had 
undergone earlier that year, although he later said it was “not in itself so much an 
experience, as a shift in the context in which he held all process, including experi-
ence” (Bartley 168). In some traditions, such an event might be referred to as an
individual’s having undergone enlightenment; Erhard has called it a transformation.
He was, at this point in his life, a highly successful sales manager and trainer for a 
large publishing company. Further, he had devoted much of the previous decade to 
the rigorous exploration of various systems of enlightenment and personal devel-
opment, from Zen (the essential one, he says) to the Dale Carnegie course and Mind
Dynamics. But one morning in 1971, as he was driving across the Golden Gate Bridge
en route to his office, he suddenly realized that he knew nothing. As he related the
incident to his biographer, William Bartley:
All the things I had ever heard, and read, and all those hours 
of practice, suddenly fell into place. It was so stupidly,
blindingly simple that I could not believe it. I saw that there
were no hidden meanings, that everything was just the 
way that it is, and that I was already all right. . . . I realized 
that I was not my emotions or thoughts. I was not my 
ideas, my intellect, my perceptions, my beliefs. . . . I was 
simply the space, the creator, the source of all that stuff. I
experienced Self as Self in a direct, unmediated way. I didn’t 
just experience Self; I became Self. Suddenly I held all the 
information, the content, in my life in a new way, from a new
mode, a new context. . . .  I am I am. (Bartley 167–168)
In other words, an experience of being. The insight Erhard derived from that ex-
perience subsequently became what thousands of est trainees would spend two
t
weekends and several hundred dollars to “get” for themselves. 
Discussing his work later, Erhard addressed the challenge he had confronted in
attempting to communicate what seemed essentially incommunicable: “You can’t
do this in the ordinary sense of communication: I can’t have it and give it to you. But
I can communicate in a way so that you get an opportunity to realize that you have 
it yourself already. Essentially, this is what the est Training was developed to do. It
t
provides a setting in which this kind of sharing takes place” (Bartley 169).
From the outset, the language of est was central to both its pedagogical process 
and its public image. A fundamental tenet of the est Training, as well as its succes-
t
sor program, The Forum, has been that transformation lives in language, and that 
participants keep the program’s results available in their lives by communicating 
those results with others. At the same time, Erhard’s enterprise has consistently 
eschewed traditional advertising. The only way people have become aware of his 
work has been through hearing about it from their friends, family, or associates. 
The resulting symbiotic relationship—the program survives only when participants 
communicate about it with family and friends, and it is through communicating
about it that participants keep the benefits alive in their experience—has served the 
work well through four decades. By 1985, when the est Training was discontinued
t
and replaced by The Forum, word-of-mouth had brought a half-million people to see
for themselves what this transformation was all about. As of 2019, another 2 million

Forum (www.landmarkworldwide.com).1
Erhard’s influence on the culture has made itself felt in another way as well. 
During the 1970s, when it sometimes seemed that every fifth person in San Francis-
co was an est graduate, you could generally detect that element of the population
t
by their use of the program’s language, which in casual use began to be heard as
jargon. Erhard’s use of this terminology, however, was highly purposive, and many
of those words and phrases made their way into the public sphere, some to last-
ing effect. An example has been the shift in the popular understanding of the term 
sharing. Before est, people shared a cookie or a bench in the park; what was shared
was divided, and in the process one’s own share was inevitably diminished. But
in the est Training, 
g participants shared their experience, and through sharing, that 
experience was augmented. To share, in the world of est, was to communicate in
such a way that one’s self and not merely one’s story was made available, leaving the
f
other touched rather than merely informed. This meaning of the word, we assert, is 
now common in our culture. Likewise, the term coaching, borrowed by Erhard from
the sports arena in the early eighties to identify the style of his pedagogy, has since
become ubiquitous in the field of management, human resources, and executive 
coaching. And the ubiquitous Mastercard catchphrase, “Master the possibilities,”
was born in the mind of an est graduate for whom the term
t
possibility had acquired
a new level of meaning; however, through overuse in the media, this new level of 
meaning has diminished.
The move to discontinue the Training in 1985 and replace it with The Forum 
arose from Erhard’s perception of a shift in the culture’s way of responding to the 
Training; he wanted to design a course that was responsive to that shift. At this 
point, while Erhard’s success during those years had been greeted by considerable 
media curiosity, scholarly interest was moderate. Several studies of the est Training
t
attempted to measure its effects using a psychological model; while he considered
such efforts valuable, Erhard has asserted that this approach is inappropriate for 
analysis of his work. His work, he says, is not psychological but ontological: his 
concern is the being of human beings (“Heart of the Matter” 1984). He has also 
consistently emphasized that the focus of his work is the development of the lan-
guage in which it is articulated. Yet no significant scholarly work dealing either with
Erhard’s language use, or with the nature of an ontological methodology, has been 
published, even in the academic fields most likely to be deeply concerned with
such matters—rhetoric and writing studies, business management, philosophy, and 
communication studies. This book aims to begin to correct that omission.
Before proceeding, we offer this statement of authorial stance: The authors
have engaged extensively, both as participants and as scholars, in numerous pro-
grams designed by Werner Erhard. The senior author took the est Training for the
t
first time in 1973, and we have each participated a number of times in The Forum, 
both during Erhard’s tenure in the organization and following his departure. Our 
doctoral dissertations (University of Southern California, 1990; University of Arizona,
2008) consisted of rhetorical and philosophical analyses of The Forum. Based upon
this considerable study and experience, our assessment of Erhard’s work is un-
equivocal: we have found this work to be pedagogically effective and intellectually 
significant in all of its historical iterations. Our intention in this book is to stimulate
its serious consideration by the academic community, as well as by others in the
culture at large.
It is also important to note that our approach as participant observers has
its limits. To carry out the design of the book, we have precluded a number of 
approaches that readers may wish to see addressed, and we beg those readers to 
indulge us. Before any significant and critical treatments could be viable, or even 
possible, from a number of disciplines—including philosophy, communication stud-
ies, rhetorical criticism, and so on—the phenomenon must be first made available. 
We present this book as a way into the phenomenon in question, and consequently,
we invite members from a range of academic disciplines to enter the conversation
we are seeking to initiate.
Evolution 
This is an historical document. It presents an account of one moment—albeit a sig-
nificant one—in an ongoing project for the development of human being. The first 
iteration of this project, the est Training, was designed to communicate to people
t
living in the cultural environment of the 1970s. As Erhard saw it, considerable logis-
tical rigor was required for the course to achieve its purpose, and thus the format
included demands for which est soon became notorious, including lengthy sessions
t
1 Landmark describes The Landmark Forum as a personal and professional development program,
based on the discipline of applied ontology and phenomenology. Erhard created the work in the
early 1970s and continued its development until in 1991 Landmark took over its ongoing devel-
opment as expressed in The Landmark Forum and other Landmark programs. As of the writing of 
this book, the material and structure of The Forum have continued to be developed during three 
decades since the 1989 Forum presented in this book. The Landmark Forum of today (circa 2019) 
is less time (three days and an evening and each day ends by 10:00 pm), it incorporates the use of 
PowerPoint displays and videos that enhance the participants’ experience of and access to what is
being presented, and there is no use of profanity on the part of the program leaders.

with limited bathroom breaks, a highly confrontational interaction style—with
the use of expletives—and the surrender of all wristwatches at the door. These
demands were modified when The Forum replaced the Training; and in subsequent 
years, as the communication paradigm of the culture has continued to shift, the 
delivery of The Forum has altered accordingly.
On the one hand, of course, The Forum conversation inevitably challenges 
participants’ familiar way of seeing things. Ontological inquiry—pedagogy such as 
The Forum, that aims to get beyond mere conceptual knowledge—is of necessity 
rigorous and sometimes uncomfortable. In Martin Heidegger’s words, authentic in-
quiry into Being always “has the character of doing violence, whether to the claims 
of the everyday interpretation, or to its complacency and tranquillized obviousness”
(BT 359). But while the conversation in the current Landmark Forum remains rigor-
T
ous, participants will find a presentation that can for the most part be described as 
gentler, and more user-friendly, than the one presented in this book. 
A further aspect of this difference, of course, has to do with Werner Erhard’s
personal style. In his delivery of both the Training and The Forum, Erhard’s com-
munication was edgily playful and relentlessly purposive. He called his approach
ruthless compassion; and it included a profound sense of humor and Socratic 
irony implicit in the human condition. To communicate the humor as well as the 
compassion, he often provoked and insulted participants, using language gener-
ally considered inappropriate for such a setting (in a parody of one of his favorite 
epithets, graduates of the Training were sometimes referred to as “estholes”). Yet, as 
this book shows, those participants who initially resisted these intrusions inevitably
got the message. Erhard has related this confrontive aspect of his communication
to his 1971 experience of transformation: “On the bridge,” he said, “all of a sudden I 
could be 100% responsible for everything in my life, and at the same time none of it 
had any significance. At that point you are free and fearless” (Erhard, interview with 
authors). Erhard’s communication style, and his humor, remain on full display in this 
book; the authors see them as important and entertaining aspects of the historical 
account we are presenting here.
Erhard Encounters Heidegger
Despite the shift we have cited here in The Forum’s style and tone, a central thesis
of this book is that from the first offering of the est Training in 1971, through its
t
replacement by the Forum in 1985 and its current iteration as the Landmark Forum, 
the process at the heart of this pedagogy has retained its transformational
dynamic. This dynamic, as we will show, arises in the unspoken ontological realm
of The Forum conversation as it proceeds, and has been the essential element of the 
course through all of its terminological variations. 
During the transition to The Forum, Erhard excised many of the est Training’s 
t
more meditative exercises and incorporated into the course a new vocabulary and
redesigned procedures, with the stated intention that participants would have an 
enhanced experience of creating a new realm of possibility for themselves and their 
y
lives. At about this time, through colleagues, he was introduced to the work of the
twentieth-century German philosopher Martin Heidegger. Erhard was taken with the 
way Heidegger’s thinking reverberated with his own, and he consulted with several 
Heideggerian scholars on the subject. Two of them—Hubert Dreyfus of University of 
California, Berkeley and Michael E. Zimmerman of Tulane—provided formal assess-
ments of the est Training’s effectiveness, and noted its consistencies with elements 
t
of Heidegger’s thought. When Erhard’s revised technology emerged in The Forum
and other redesigned courses, significant Heideggerian terminology was included 
in its rhetorical mix, and Erhard occasionally read passages from Heidegger in his
presentations.
Most significantly, Erhard saw that Heidegger’s ideas and his own were commu-
nicating from the same unspoken realm, and that the specifications of the two vo-
cabularies could be merged to communicate that realm more powerfully: “I learned
from Heidegger,” said Erhard, “nuances of what I had been saying that clarified and
made more potent what was there” (Erhard, interview with authors). 
What was there was Erhard’s technology of language for the communication of 
being, and its ability, in both the Training and The Forum, to consistently and pow-
erfully evoke an experience that participants found transformative. The evocation
of that experience has remained The Forum’s essential element; Erhard’s encounter 
with Heidegger enriched the vocabulary in which he could see into it more pro-
foundly and communicate it more effectively. 
Technology
The form of this study will be comparative analysis: we will demonstrate that the 
work of Werner Erhard is aligned in significant ways with the philosophy of Martin
Heidegger, and that a comparison of their work illuminates the thinking of both
men. We will show that The Forum’s dialogic form introduces a performative dimen-
sion of Heidegger’s ontological vocabulary in a way that Heidegger himself, working 
within a restrictive academic and political culture, was unable to do. We propose 
that The Forum conversation is ontological rhetoric: purposive speaking that com-
municates and makes present a context of meaning that, if left unexamined, shapes

SPEAKING BEING
thesis is that the work of Werner Erhard makes available the ontological domain of 
language, so that the decentering of subjectivity and the reinvention of the self can
be experienced as possibilities rather than merely considered as theory. 
We recognize that this pedagogical model is in many ways a radical one, given
the strength of the assumptions embedded in our tradition; but Heidegger says that 
an experience with language in the ontological domain always requires “a leap.” 
As our educational institutions struggle increasingly to generate an opening for the
human in the face of the advance of the technological, we argue that the situation is
critical, and that a leap of this kind is in order.
The Plan of the Book
The central text for this book, located in the left and right columns on either page, 
is the combination of two sources: notes taken by the senior author while observing
a Forum in San Francisco led by Werner Erhard in December 1989, and a transcrip-
tion of the video of the same four-day event made available to the junior author on 
location at Landmark Worldwide’s archives. While the transcript provides compre-
hensive and detailed conversations of the actual 1989 Forum, there are important
alterations that must be accounted for. First and foremost, all names have been 
altered except for Werner Erhard, and actual names have been used only for those 
participants who speak more than once or twice with Erhard or the other two indi-
viduals leading the course (“Kipp” and “Wes”). In addition, some conversations have 
been edited out, or summarized, for the sake of space. For instance, all discussions 
dealing with the Six-Day Course, discontinued in 1990, have been removed. Also
missing from the transcript is the Evening Session of the 1989 Forum: there was 
no extant video recording of that event. However, that omission can be rectified 
for interested readers if they were to attend an evening session of The Landmark
Forum, where participants will share their experience of the course for guests they
themselves have invited.
We call the text that accompanies the transcript either “sidebars” or “intervals.” 
Sidebars occur in the central columns between the far left and right panes that 
house the transcript of The Forum, and the intervals occur between sessions of the
course, and at the conclusion of each of the four days. In the sidebars and intervals 
are relevant ideas from the thinking of Martin Heidegger. Sometimes the connection 
between a sidebar and the transcript it accompanies may be apparent; sometimes 
it may be intended obliquely, as a hint at the background. Intervals are more often
oblique in this way due to the focus on Heidegger’s thinking in its wider arcs, for 
and limits our way of being. However, this context of meaning cannot be spoken
directly. It becomes present by virtue of what is said.
The dynamic of Erhard’s technology of language responds directly to issues 
raised by Heidegger in his 1954 essay, “The Question Concerning Technology” (Basic 
Writings). Technology’s essence, proposes Heidegger, is its relentless demand that
all of nature, including human beings, be placed in standing reserve, on call for the
uses of technology itself.  The way of being evoked by this development (i.e., that we 
ourselves function as “calculable material” in a cybernetic system designed to serve 
ourselves) poses the danger that we may become lost in the profound reflexivity of 
that system, and, most fatally, may forget that anything has been lost. Surrender to 
technology “threatens man with the possibility that it could be denied to him to en-
ter into a more original revealing and hence to experience the call of a more primal 
truth” (“QCT” in BW 333). Such surrender, however, seems inevitable: the technolog-
W
ical epoch is where we have landed, the only way of being we have been provided, 
and resistance is as futile as surrender is fatal. 
But Heidegger suggests a middle path, a “comportment toward technology
which expresses ‘yes’ and at the same time ‘no’” (DT 54). Further, he proposes that
T
“essential reflection upon technology and decisive confrontation with it must hap-
pen in a realm that is, on the one hand, akin to the essence of technology, and, on 
the other, fundamentally different from it”(“QCT” in BW 340). We suggest that Wer-
W
ner Erhard’s work provides such a realm. It is both a manifestation of the technolog-
ical epoch and a subversive appropriation of its impulse, a thinking which reaches
beyond the technological paradigm by reaching through that paradigm.
In Academia
 For half a century, postmodern and poststructuralist theories across many disci-
plines have theorized a new freedom from the constraints of the Cartesian model
of human being. Human subjectivity has been decentered; the self is no longer 
understood as the fixed and self-certain cogito but is open to creative reinvention;
language does not merely re-present a preexisting world of objective meanings, but
in fact generates the meanings that constitute that world. 
These theoretical assertions concern being. But their effective communication
in the universities has been hindered by our epistemologically-based academic
tradition, which assumes that the central dynamic of education is knowing. This has 
given rise to a pedagogical model in which the ontological domain must always re-
main merely conceptual, because being is not apprehended by knowing. The book’s

ing group. To the group, composed of Allan Cohen, Joe DiMaggio, Bruce Gregory, 
Michael C. Jensen, Sigurfreyr Jonasson, David C. Logan, Nicholas Merton, Daniel 
Rogerson, Steve Zaffron, and Michael E. Zimmerman—we want you to know our im-
measurable joy when we received feedback that could only come from the deepest
appreciation. For granting access to Landmark Worldwide’s archives to allow for the 
production of an accurate and complete transcript, we thank Harry Rosenberg, Mick
Leavitt and Landmark Worldwide staff. To the Wiley team, including Shannon Vargo,
Sally Baker, Peter Knox, Deborah Schindlar, and Jocelyn Kwiatkowski: thank you for 
taking a risk on this project—given its untraditional scope, design, and size—and
for taking such great care throughout all stages of bringing this book into the world.
To Lou Agosta, Jeff Bineham, Richard Doyle, Charles Guignon, Michael J. Hyde,
and Carolyne White—together with the members of Lecole book club—thank you
for reviewing and responding to the early versions of the manuscript; we hope your 
thoughtful attention presages serious study of this rich rhetorical phenomenon 
within such academic fields as rhetoric and writing studies, education, philosophy,
and communication studies.
Last, Bruce and I together stand in ovation to the man who has made, and will
continue to make, the difference for both of us and countless others—the difference
for all those who have had the opportunity, the gift, to be and speak with him—for 
in the very act of speaking being we create possibility for ourselves and our lives. 
Werner Erhard: Thank you for providing a way to say what otherwise remains 
forever unsayable.
instance, the central theme of “the forgetting of Being,” which has eight parts.
Our purpose in this book is not to explain The Forum, or Heidegger’s philosophy—
although there are moments where we do provide analysis—but rather, we primarily
aim to engage the reader in thinking Erhard’s and Heidegger’s ideas for themselves.
For readers who have previously participated in The Forum, we believe the con-
fluence here of Heidegger’s thinking with Erhard’s will enrich the way those readers
hold their Forum experience.  This has been true for the authors, and it is likewise
consistent with the experience of Werner Erhard, for whom exposure to Heidegger’s 
thinking provided profound insights (Erhard, interview with authors). We intend that 
this book, in a dialogue with its readers, will evoke such insights.  
Martin Heidegger once cautioned his students not to focus too closely on the
concepts in his lectures, but rather to follow the “movement of showing” (OTB 2).
The Forum conversation, we assert, is a carefully designed movement in language 
for the showing of being. In this book, we will show that showing. Our goal—Heide-
gger’s, Erhard’s, the authors’—is the unconcealment of a powerful aspect of human
being with which we are, for the most part, unfamiliar.
While it may go without saying, reading this book will not provide an experience
of The Forum. We intend to hint at that experience, and we encourage readers for 
whom our hints are provocative to seek out the experience for themselves. The Forum
occurs essentially as a dialogue; ontological inquiry demands interactive play, and 
needs “the widest sphere in which to swing” (“DL” in OWL 27). In written form, Heideg-
ger warned, “the movement of the questioning that is called for here might too easily 
congeal” (“DL” in OWL 50). 
Nonetheless, as we undertake this project, the authors stand in the open ques-
tion: What is the possibility of communicating being? This is not a questioning that
seeks an answer; rather, the inquiry it generates persistently reflects the question 
itself back upon the questioner, undermining comforting and limiting assumptions.
Thus we see it as a transformational question. We invite the reader to join us in this 
inquiry.
Acknowledgments
It is impossible to list all those who have contributed significantly to the composi-
tion of this book; to do so with full integrity would mean naming all who have risked 
what it means to hear the unsaid in what is said. In particular, our gratitude goes
to several extraordinary individuals without whom our work would have failed to
move beyond the planning stages, including first, Barbara Stevenson and Sheryl

Forum Day One: Session One 
7
 PRELUDE
More than 700 people were assembled in the ballroom of the Hyatt Regency Hotel in San 
Francisco on the morning of December 27th, 1989. This was the first day of The Forum, and the 
occasion was unique in several ways. The first was that this Forum was to be led by Werner 
Erhard himself. Although he had created the technology of language that constituted The
Forum, since 1973, to accommodate growing demand for the program across the United States 
and in Europe, the course had increasingly been led by members of a growing body of est
Trainers, and later Forum leaders, a group of men and women trained by Erhard. As of 1989 
there were forty-three Forum leaders, ten women and thirty-three men.
A second unique aspect of this four-day event was that it was an exceptionally large Forum
composed of various groups in addition to the 502 regular participants (the usual number
ranged from 100 to 250). Forty Forum leaders were also present as part of their training; during 
breaks in the procedure, they met with Erhard for debriefing sessions that the senior author 
attended as part of a special program for Forum graduates called Openings, a group of approx-
imately 100 participants who were permitted to observe without actively participating. Also 
in the room were a number of invited observers who occupied a visitors’ gallery and whose
number varied during the course of The Forum. Last, a large contingent of staff and assistants
(volunteers) performed logistical duties throughout the four days. 
Due to the efforts of the assistants, the ballroom set-up remained consistent across all 
sessions of each of the four days. Regular participants and Forum leaders were seated in rows,
theater-style, before a raised platform which stretched across most of the width of the room, 
and included a runway section extending well into the center of the audience area. Arranged
on the platform were three chalkboards, two bar-height director’s chairs, a music stand, and
a large table which held a water pitcher and glasses, tissues, and writing materials. Openings 
participants and other observers were seated on risers at the rear of the room. Also at the rear
of the room was an enclosed translators’ booth: among the participants in Openings were 
twenty-five observers from Japan, seminar leaders and staff members in the Tokyo office of 
Werner Erhard and Associates. They listened to the proceedings in simultaneous translation 
through earphones connected to the translators’ booth. Finally, three television cameras were
placed strategically around the room to record the event, and several television monitors were 
placed so that most participants could watch the proceedings on video if they chose.
THE FORUM BEGINS
At 9:00 am, unannounced, Werner Erhard walked onto the platform. His manner was relaxed 
and casual. He wore dark tan slacks, a white shirt open at the collar, and an olive sweater 
vest. He greeted the participants in a friendly way, welcomed guests, and asked for questions 
while late arrivals were completing their paperwork. He asked if there was anything about the
television cameras that needed clearing up, and he explained the presence of the Openings
participants and the observers seated in the Gallery. Someone asked about the people wearing
earphones, and he explained about the translators and participants from Japan. “That’s a good 
question,” he said. “Questions like that . . . what about, what if?”
Participants who raised their hands were asked to stand and wait until they were given a 
microphone; an assistant was stationed on each aisle to deliver one. After Erhard responded

SPEAKING BEING
Talking about Being
One of the similarities between the work of Werner Erhard and
Martin Heidegger is that both are designing a language for a 
specific purpose: the evocation of Being. Since the debut of The 
Forum in 1985, Erhard has regularly incorporated Heideggerian 
terminology into his vocabulary, and has quoted Heidegger 
extensively in his courses. It is the primary thesis of this book that 
Erhard’s work is aligned in significant ways with the philosophy of 
Martin Heidegger. Even the est Training, the beginnings of which
t
predate Erhard’s encounter with Heidegger (circa 1980), already
was aligned in significant ways with Heidegger’s thinking. This
alignment allowed Erhard to creatively incorporate Heideggerian
language in the delivery of what would become The Forum.
Heidegger’s language, on first encounter, is notoriously 
difficult; he regularly invented new German terms for his ideas,
and translators have struggled to capture his meanings. Erhard
likewise uses words in unconventional ways, and calls his work
a “technology of language” in recognition of that fact. It is the
experience of the authors that a comparative inquiry into the two 
bodies of work illuminates the thinking of both men, and helps
to clarify the linguistic complexity of Heidegger’s writing. In this 
book, we intend gradually to unconceal (a Heideggerian term 
l
Erhard has used) that clarity (IM 116). 
This is not to say that either body of thought ever reaches the
kind of logical understandability that we generally expect in what
we read and hear. “If you walk out of here understanding,” Erhard
tells The Forum participants at one point, “that’s the booby prize.” 
Both Heidegger and Erhard are attempting to communicate
something that, on that familiar level, cannot be communicated 
or grasped. This is new territory for communication, and requires 
both a new language (or, as Erhard says, new “languaging”) and a
new way of listening.
We request, therefore, that the reader join us in embracing
the atmosphere of questionability that must surround this entire
to several questions about the various colors of name tags worn by people in the room, one 
participant raised her hand. Erhard called upon her to stand, and she asked about Erhard’s use 
of language.
ERHARD
You need a language that gives you access to the kind of detail that you need to be a brain sur-
geon... The language you and I are going to use in here is also a specifi c language. It’s designed 
to let you get at something you can’t get at without that language. Surgeons generally confi ne 
that kind of speaking to the operating room, and so do I. I don’t use that language when I’m out
to dinner. For the most part it’s unseemly to use special language when you’re with people who
don’t share in that language.
Erhard asked for more questions. After he called on someone, he explained the reasons for
standing up and for calling on multiple people (“to allow time to get microphones to them”). She 
asked about logistics. Erhard said it would happen later. She sat down.
BLAKE (after receiving a microphone from an assistant)
I don’t know whether The Forum started yet, but I wanted to get through my apprehension of 
speaking before the group.
ERHARD
I suggest that those of you who have a fear of speaking take the same opportunity as Blake did. 
In The Forum no one is required to stand up and speak, though it is in your interest to do so,
especially if you are reluctant to stand and speak.
Erhard also discussed the schedule of the course, pointing out that the daily ending time would be 
sometime between 11:00 pm and 1:00 am, adding that
ERHARD
Nobody guarantees you that schedule. You want to be clear about that. We’re going to do this 
as long as it takes to get it done.
In addition, he said, The Forum would not be complete until the completion of the evening session, 
which would be held on the following Thursday evening—simultaneously in several cities, since 
many participants in this Forum had traveled to San Francisco for this event. Participants were 
encouraged to bring guests to their respective evening sessions.
As the conversation proceeded into the second hour, it gradually became clear, without transition,
that the serious business of the course had begun. A participant named Ruth rose to say that she
was pessimistic about getting the results of The Forum. Erhard began his response by acknowledg-
ing the validity of her doubt.

Forum Day One: Session One 
9
ERHARD
Very, very little in life turns out the way it was promised. So I remember my mother told me if I 
was a good boy everything would be great in life. I tried it for one day and it didn’t work. People 
are told that when they graduate life will be wonderful, life will be easy, and it didn’t turn out 
that way. When you get married it’ll be great but it doesn’t turn out that way. People say when 
you get divorced it’ll be all right but it doesn’t turn out that way. Most things don’t live up to
their promises.
RUTH
And what about the promises of The Forum?
ERHARD
Based on surveys, most people who’ve done this work say it turned out better than they expect-
ed. For you that’ll be easy, because you have a pessimistic view about how things’ll turn out. 
We’ve got your six hundred dollars. You’re not going to get it back. Given that conversation’s 
over, it’ll turn out however it turns out. You know, I’ve never been wrong about that.
(To Ruth)
I could say a lot of things to reassure you, and that would be a mistake. Your pessimism is you.
(raising his voice, he turned to the group)
Listen up! If you haven’t noticed, The Forum has begun. See, you and I think that our mood, 
our internal state, the way we are seeing things; we think that is a product of the circumstanc-
t
es. So I look at something and I like it, or I look at something and I don’t like it. I think if I 
like it, it’s the fault of the thing I’m looking at, and if I don’t like it, I think it’s the fault of the 
thing I’m looking at. That’s the kind of thing that generates in me: “like”; and that’s the kind 
of thing that generates in me: “don’t like.” You and I think that our way of being is a product of 
what’s over there. As you will see as we do The Forum together a lot of what is going on with
you and me is something we already always are. It’s something I am before anything happens. 
I’m kind of a pessimist waiting for life to happen, or I’m an optimist waiting for life to happen. 
About certain kinds of things I’m a pessimist before I even look at them, and then when I look 
at them, it’s hard for me to recognize that the pessimism isn’t generated out of the thing I’m 
looking at, but it’s something I brought with me. Kind of like I was already always pessimistic
and then this thing came along. So it’s good that you’re pessimistic, and if you’re not pessimis-
tic, that’s good too.
(to Ruth)
If you find yourself being that way, don’t try to change it. What’s good is whatever you are, 
because that’s what you want to bring into The Forum. If you deal with that pessimism
which you are in a certain way, you’ll have a choice about being pessimistic when it is ap-
propriate. Pessimism is not a bad idea, and if you didn’t have pessimism I would give it to 
you, because one of the things you’re going to find in here is that we ask you not to believe 
anything that’s said in here. We’ll talk more about that later. At any rate, the point that 
project. There is a sense in which we don’t know what we are
talking about, and the emphasis in that sentence should be placed 
on the word “know,” as implying a secure conceptual grasp. 
Talking about Being is challenging and sometimes feels, to use
the vernacular, weird. Being is both pervasive and evanescent. It 
is elusive, vanishing even as it appears. 
In his writing about Being (and all of his writing is about 
Being), Heidegger celebrates the ambiguity surrounding the topic.
This is “something which every thinker has to see afresh each 
time, else he is not a thinker: that everything that lies before us is
ambiguous” (WCT 201). However, this does not mean fuzziness at
T
the expense of rigor: 
NOTE:  Erhard believes that Heidegger’s use of the word 
“thought” leaves people misled about what Heidegger 
means in the following way: Perhaps the word “thought” is 
valid for what is written down for people to consider, but it
did not come from “thinking”—by which most people will
understand “figuring it out”—it came from something like 
“looking,” or “just being with,” and is pointed to by the word 
“wonder” (Erhard, interview with the authors).
This multiplicity of possible interpretations
does not discredit the strictness of the thought
content. For all true thought remains open 
to more than one interpretation—and this by 
reason of its nature. Nor is this multiplicity of 
possible interpretations merely the residue
of a still unachieved formal-logical univocity 
which we properly ought to strive for but did 
not attain. Rather, multiplicity of meanings is 
the element in which all thought must move in 
order to be strict thought. (WCT 71)

SPEAKING BEING
Nevertheless, despite its challenges, we assert that Being is 
also the most important thing that one could talk about, since 
talk that evokes Being has the ability to transform talk about 
everything else.
A fundamental difference in this arena is the distinction
between ontological and 
l
ontic inquiry. Ontological inquiry is 
concerned primarily with Being. Therefore all of Heidegger’s
writing, and all of the dialogue of The Forum, is ontological in 
nature. Ontic inquiry is concerned with beings, and with facts 
about them. Therefore all of our everyday conversations—
everything from political discourse to casual social chat—may be
seen as ontic. 
This is not to dismiss ontic inquiry as unimportant, or to 
equate a discussion of religion or physics with coffeeshop banter. 
We are not claiming that ontological inquiry is better, but that 
it is essentially different. And in the experience of the authors, 
it is profoundly interesting because of its transformational 
possibilities. In this book, we will illuminate the nature of 
ontological inquiry.
A prefatory note: people who write about Heidegger’s 
work differ as to whether the term Being should be capitalized.
This is, of course, a choice for translators and not one that 
confronted Heidegger, since in German all nouns are capitalized. 
It is a problematic choice because capitalization tends to reify 
or even deify, suggesting to some scholars that Being is “an 
eternal metaphysical foundation or eternal principle,” while 
for Heidegger it was “the event in which an entity reveals or 
t
shows itself” (Michael E. Zimmerman, Heidegger’s Confrontation 
with Modernity: Technology, Politics, Art xxii). Others feel that
t
capitalization is important so that what it means to exist (Being)
is not confused with the entities that exist (beings) (Richard Polt
Heidegger: An Introduction 3). 
In print, Erhard himself did not capitalize the term: a 1985 
Forum brochure states that the purpose of The Forum is to 
provide participants with “direct access to the domain of being 
itself.” In his more recent work, such as documents outlining 
I want to make now is that whatever it is that you’re feeling, or whatever it is that you’re
thinking, or whatever your mental state is, or whatever your perception is, the way you are
viewing things—that’s exactly the way it ought to be. I’m going to probably have to say that 
to you ten times, because you won’t remember that.
(to the group)
Another way you already always are is stupid about yourself. If that sounded a little bit like an
insult, you got it right. You may not be able to see that about yourself, but you’ll be able to see it
about others. As I said: not you, but other people.
(laughter)
There are ways of being with yourself that are disempowering and disenabling. You lose power 
and you lose ability. Whatever way you fi nd yourself now, and whatever ways you fi nd yourself 
variously throughout The Forum or in the evenings, or on the breaks: that’s the way you’re sup-
posed to be—whatever way that is. One way to disempower or disenable yourself is to question
whether you are being the right way... You’ll get a lot more out of The Forum a lot faster if you 
let yourself be the way you are.
(pausing)
There’s a lot of this you’re not going to get. Some of it won’t make any sense. You’re not going 
to get the whole Forum. The questions we’re asking in here are too powerful to get it all. The 
Forum leaders are still getting it. So am I. But there are parts when you need to get it. In those
parts, put up your hand if you don’t. There will be a lot of repetition in here, too. For the fourth
time: you should be the way you are! However you feel, that’s the way it ought to be. The way 
I know that is, that’s the way it is... The only right way to do The Forum is to be the way you’re 
being. If you say you shouldn’t be pessimistic, you’re getting in your way.
A participant complained that she was distracted by and resentful about the physical set-up for this 
Forum—the cameras, the observers, etc.
ERHARD
What you want to get out of that is that life is upsetting because it isn’t the way you expected it 
to be. The Forum will be that way also. What you want to get out of that is that you’re already 
upset. You’re already always upset at any change, at anything that violates your expectations. 
You think you’re not upset until something violates your expectations. I said this strange thing:
you are already always upset. You live upset. I know you don’t believe that and I’m not asking 
you to. You’re an upset waiting to happen. You’ll see that more clearly as we proceed.
LYNETTE
I’m often upset.
ERHARD
You’re always upset, and sometimes you notice it.

Forum Day One: Session One

LYNETTE
Do you have any more advice about how to get the most out of this?
ERHARD
I do and we’ll go over that this morning.
TRENT
I hear there are Forum leaders here.
ERHARD
Forum leaders are here as part of their job.
TRENT
Four consecutive days instead of two weekends?
ERHARD
We’ve done this using odd schedules in diff erent settings, for instance, in  prisons.
BLAKE (who expressed reservations about speaking)
Continuing what you were saying as far as upset is concerned, and always being with you. My 
barrier is the fear of revealing who I am. I should accept that.
ERHARD
Whatever you think is in the way, especially those things you think are part of the circum-
stances—for instance, you don’t get along with your boss and it’s quite clear to you that’s 
because you work for a jerk—bring that in here. Blake is clear that it’s something he carries
around with him; it doesn’t come out of the circumstances. That’s easy. It’s the stuff  you think
is a product of the circumstances. So if there are circumstances in here, for instance, because
there are people observing—that sounds like it is a product of the circumstances.
CHRISSY
You talked about being in The Forum whatever way you are being. What about outside
The Forum?
ERHARD
Let yourself be like you are in those parts of The Forum that are outside The Forum, for
homework assignments during the breaks, etc. If that’s your mood at the moment, don’t try to
change it. You want it there because if it isn’t there it’s not going to get dealt with—particularly 
those things you think are part of the circumstances: bring that in here. Most of what you do
outside The Forum in the next four days is going to be inside The Forum. If you do something 
to avoid that, then you’ve successfully avoided that once more. See, there’s a lot of this you’re
his development of an ontological/phenomenological model of 
leadership (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/ cf_dev/ AbsByAuth.
cfm?per_id=433651), he continues to employ the lowercase. 
In this book, we will employ capitalization in those instances 
where it clarifies the word’s meaning in a specific sentence. 
We raise the point here to emphasize the unique nature of the
issues that arise in any discussion, oral or written, of this subject. 
Being/being, as an ontological phenomenon, defies grammatical
categorization. ■
NOTE:  As of 2019, Landmark Worldwide’s Forum leader

SPEAKING BEING
not going to like. You’re sitting there now with a whole bunch of assessments and conclusions.
We’ve done this a lot. I can even tell you what your assessments and conclusions are.
A participant asked whether, based on all of this, he should keep his specifi c issues and concerns
foremost in his mind.
ERHARD
You don’t need to have something you’re kind of holding in place. We will hook what’s there
in you that’s appropriate to be hooked and pull it up to the surface. So you can kind of relax 
about that. A lot of stuff  you won’t even think about will get handled in here.
Another participant asked about the history of the organization.
ERHARD
We’ve been doing this work since 1971 and it was at the end of 1984 that we fi nished a four-
year process of developing The Forum, and we’ve been off ering The Forum since 1985 all over 
this country, and in lots of other countries around the world.
At this point, a man named Jake rose to complain about the purpose of the evening session, to
which participants had been encouraged to invite guests.
JAKE
Isn’t that more for Werner Erhard and Associates to hustle more members?
ERHARD
You know that you are a hustle waiting to happen, right?
JAKE
I said I feel like I’m being hustled.
ERHARD
I said you are a guy who is being hustled waiting to happen.
JAKE
I don’t mind being hustled.
ERHARD
I said you are a guy who is being hustled waiting to happen.
JAKE
I don’t see it that way.
Erhard came down from the stage and sat on the edge of the platform near him.
Dasein
At the outset, it is important to introduce a term that is central 
in Martin Heidegger’s work, and will therefore begin to come up 
here almost immediately.
Dasein is Heidegger’s word for the Being of human beings,
and is one of the few terms in English editions of his writing 
that consistently remain untranslated from the German. In 
fact, the 2014 Dictionary of Untranslatables, published by
Princeton University Press, calls the word “a paradigm of the 
untranslatable,” and devotes six double-columned pages to a
struggle to explain it (Adam Gopnik, “Word Magic,” New Yorker,. 
May 26, 2014, 37).
A problem with translating this term, of course, is that term
is central in Heidegger’s most important work, Being and Time, 
in which he presents his ontological model of human beings. 
The specific elements of this model will be discussed in further 
detail as we proceed. For now, it is sufficient to note that Dasein 
will be spoken of as if the term indicates an individual; but since
it indicates the Being of that individual, it refers at the same time 
more broadly to the collective Being of human beings.

ERHARD
You’re oriented around being hustled. You would see hustle where other people wouldn’t be
smart enough to see it.
JAKE
I could go along with that.
ERHARD
You are a guy who is being hustled waiting to happen. Remember I said people are upset wait-
ing to happen? You’re hustle waiting to happen.
JAKE
I’m still not getting it.
ERHARD
Okay good, then we’ll keep doing it until you do get it.
JAKE
In front of all these people? 
ERHARD
Sure. You see hustle where others don’t. You are already always being hustled. You are waiting 
for it to happen. You wake up that way in the morning, you just don’t have the circumstances to 
express it yet.
JAKE
I think I see that... I am. I’m on the watch-out. I watch my bucks.
ERHARD
I’ve already got your bucks, don’t I? Before this is over I’m going to get some more of your
bucks.
JAKE
That’s a challenge.
ERHARD
With you, I’d almost bet on it.
He remained seated on the edge of the platform as this interaction modulated from confrontational 
to friendly.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (continuing)
That by the way was meant as a compliment. I’m going to off er you an opportunity to do this 
for the rest of your life, because I’m clear that you’re going to get a lot of value out of this and
I’m going to off er you the opportunity to get more value. You will always have the power to
decline. I want you to know that’s there in the relationship between me and you. I have no
reluctance to hustling you, because you always have the power to decline. Is that clear?
JAKE
Yeah, I got it.
The fi rst morning of The Forum continued as a dialogue with the group as Erhard responded to
participants’ questions. One woman expressed a concern that the content would go “over her head.”
ERHARD
Most of what I say is not designed for your head. Understanding is not the problem in life. If 
you took a four-day course in how to be a tennis player and you left the course as a great tennis 
player without understanding a word of it, the diff erence would be your being a great tennis
player. We don’t promise you any understanding. You’re welcome to understand. I like this 
stuff , so I enjoy understanding it. That’s a quirk in me. We do this so that there’s a freedom
to be. If you walk out understanding, that’s the booby prize. You walk out of here with the 
freedom to be that you didn’t have when you walked in here, then you got something for your
money. Speaking in here is designed to create the freedom to be... You don’t understand what 
that means. What interests me is the freedom to be. You’ll be interested in that too before this 
is over. I’ve done The Forum before so I know it works out.
A woman stated that she was already always nervous.
ERHARD (to the group)
How many people in here are already always nervous? 
(most raising their hands)
You understand that the things that are going on with you are going on with everybody? You’re 
like a rainstorm. You’ve got to get that there’s nothing personal about a rainstorm—that is,
that it waters the little fl owers. You think that the rainstorm is worried about life on earth. You 
think that it rains so that... it rains in-order-to. It’s true that life is sustained by the rain, but it’s
not true that it rains in-order-to.
SAL (standing up, receiving a microphone)
You’re just arguing semantics.
ERHARD
No, it’s not semantics. Or the other answer to that is, yes it’s semantics, but so is everything else 
in the universe.
Two Theses
The first thesis of this book, which will be addressed directly in 
the text, is that the work of Werner Erhard is aligned in important 
ways with the thinking of Martin Heidegger. Our purpose is to 
show this alignment through a comparative analysis of their work, 
an analysis that not only illuminates the thinking of both men, but 
sheds light as well on the nature of their shared central concern.
The second thesis, equal in importance to the first, cannot 
be addressed directly in the text. We have indicated it with the 
term Being, since unless we indicate it we cannot talk about it—as 
Heidegger puts it, “one cannot get by in public without rubrics” 
(OWL 29). But the term serves merely as a place-holder, since 
what it indicates cannot be thought, or even thought about, in our

SAL 
I believe that when it rains it rains in order to sustain life.
ERHARD
Okay, let’s stay there. Anybody else in that ballpark with Sal? Stand up if you are. Stand up if it 
rains in-order-to.
(a number of people rose)
If you’re not standing and you are an in-order-to, you’re interfering with your participation in 
The Forum. These people who are standing are not silly. They’ve got their foot nailed to the 
fl oor someplace. This will happen to all of you a lot of times during The Forum.
(to Sal, indicating the director’s chair on the platform)
Are the legs there to hold up the chair? We know that the legs do hold up the chair. For the legs, 
is there any in-order-to? Are the legs in-ordering-to?
(pausing) 
It’s too hard that way... let me try something diff erent. Is the wall standing in order to hold the
ceiling up?
SAL 
Yes, in my opinion. 
ERHARD
Does the lightning lightning in order to start forest fi res?
SAL 
No.
ERHARD
Where is this organ of intentionality in the rainstorm?
SAL 
The spirituality of the universe.
ERHARD  (to the group)
He just told me where his foot’s nailed to the fl oor. He’s got something he believes so he can’t 
think about it.
(to Sal)
You think there’s an intentionality in the rainstorm. You said it’s your belief that matter was
invaded by spirit in some way. Does it rain in order to produce fl oods?
usual way of conceptualizing. Think “freedom” and a conceptual
barrage is evoked; think “Being” and the mind’s resources are few. 
Our second thesis, since it eludes capture in concepts, 
can only be hinted at. It exists always as a background, 
in a domain of language that remains always unspoken. 
Unspoken, it is the unexamined context that shapes the way we
understand everything else; unspoken, it is made present as 
the transformational background in the dialogue of The Forum;
unspoken, it is hinted at persistently in Heidegger’s writing and in 
his lectures. Our second thesis, then, is this unspoken domain of 
language, formally referred to as the ontological realm. 
In this book, to show what Werner Erhard and Martin 
Heidegger are doing in their work, the authors are called upon 
to say—to hint at—the unspoken shared dynamic at the center 
of that work. Inevitably, an element of mystery attends this
topic; but nothing here is devious or arcane. While ontological
communication makes rigorous demands on our everyday
understanding, Erhard’s work is a practical pedagogical 
methodology, demonstrating that education beyond the merely 
epistemological is a real-world possibility.
The authors intend that our second thesis will be 
communicated in the background as we proceed through this
book, leaving the reader with a hint of its nature as it emerges in
The Forum. 
One aspect of this background communication is that 
unfamiliar terms or concepts may not be fully defined at the 
point of their first appearance. Rather, they will be distinguished 
gradually as they appear and reappear in the text. A definition
specifies conceptual limits; a distinction opens a space for 
thinking and acting, and the space is expanded each time the
distinction is encountered. The goal of the inquiry, then, is 
never an answer, but the opening of a question from which 
to experience the world. We invite the reader to embrace the 
freedom that this background of questionability gives: at play in 
the question, you don’t need the right answer.  ■

SPEAKING BEING
SAL 
No.
ERHARD
So the intentionality organ is not operating when it produces fl oods?
SAL
No, that just happens.
ERHARD
But it doesn’t just happen that when it rains life is sustained? Remember, Sal, there’s no ques-
tion between you and me that water does sustain life. The  question is: does it rain in-order-to? 
Or does it just happen, and by the way, it sustains life?
At this point Sal seemed to see Erhard’s point, and sat down.
ERHARD (to Sal)
Okay. Now, just something personal between you and me. I’ve done this a lot. There’s some-
thing I appreciated about you in this conversation. You were open in the conversation.
(to the group)
Nobody’s ever going to win with me in here. Because this is my game, and only an asshole 
would try to win in another guy’s game. You and I had a discussion where we got something
t
together. Rain is impersonal. We weren’t talking about a higher order of things. I don’t want 
anybody to believe anything I say. And I’m not interested in sustaining anything you believe.
BLAKE (recalling what had happened up to this moment in the conversation)
I know that there was some sequence and I missed it. I mentioned that I was nervous, that I 
didn’t like it, and then we were talking about the rain.
ERHARD (to the group)
He just demonstrated not knowing, being clear he didn’t know. That’s diff erent from being con-
fused. This is one of those things to get. There’s a diff erence between knowing that you don’t
understand, knowing that you didn’t follow something; knowing something didn’t make sense 
and being confused are very diff erent. You didn’t invent being nervous. Even though the rain is 
impersonal, you do personally get wet. The same thing goes for being nervous. Being nervous 
is part of being human. Being human doesn’t belong to you; you belong to it. You didn’t invent 
being human. You were late for the party. Being human is an already always way of being that
you walked into. It’s like a rainstorm, and it’s true you personally got wet. You are a human
Ontologic al Dialogue
A striking aspect of Erhard’s method, one which appears again 
and again throughout The Forum, is his persistence in pressing 
any interaction or any topic of discussion through to completion. 
Complete, for Erhard, does not mean simply finished, but rather 
whole, and lacking none of its essential parts. Repeatedly, after 
he has been engaged on a particular point with an individual, he 
requests that others in the room who are not clear on that point 
stand, and works with each participant individually until all of 
them have “gotten” it for themselves. Erhard often uses the term 
“flatten” in the same sense, as in “Let’s get that one flat before 
we move on.” To get something flat, in an ontological dialogue, 
means that the item in question has been moved beyond a purely
conceptual level of understanding, and has been distinguished 
as an ontological possibility, at least in a preliminary sense. The
distinction will continue to be teased out as The Forum proceeds, 
ultimately becoming a clearing for Being; but the first step in that 
process is to flatten the concept, so that its ontological possibility 
can be heard. 
Of course, “getting it” and “being complete” might be 
read as “having surrendered to Erhard’s point of view.” Erhard 
himself seemed to support this interpretation, telling one Forum 
participant Blake, “Nobody’s ever going to win with me in here. 
Because this is my game, and only an asshole would try to win in 
another guy’s game.” During a debriefing session with The Forum 
leaders regarding their role in the dialogue, Erhard again referred 
to the process in agonistic terms: “You’ve got to have some 
appreciation for the advantage you’ve got there,” he said. “And 
yeah, you’re going to use the advantage, that’s part of the game.”

being, but you didn’t make up human being. You didn’t invent being nervous. You didn’t invent
having a barrier to expressing yourself. That doesn’t belong to you. That’s not yours. That’s in
the already always being of human being. It doesn’t belong to you; you belong to it.
(forcefully)
It owns you! You don’t own it. Being nervous owns your life. You don’t own being nervous. The 
metaphor is that there’s nothing personal about a rainstorm. It just rains, and I, you, personally 
get wet. But the rainstorm didn’t rain in order to get me wet. Being nervous is already always
there in the being of being human. And you and I walk out into that rainstorm and get wet... 
In The Forum, you get back the power to say something about your own way of being. Now 
you can only report on it. But you can’t say “I’m not nervous” and have it make any diff erence. 
After The Forum you will be able to.
BLAKE
I’m not as nervous as when I first stood up. I am here to make a change, find a new occupa-
tion, to get up in front of people. What it requires is getting up.
ERHARD
Not necessarily.
BLAKE
Well, I don’t know.
ERHARD
That’s right. And I do know.
BLAKE
That’s why I’m asking you.
ERHARD
I want to get it settled because you’re going to keep saying those stupid kinds of things: what
you have to do and what you don’t have to do for this to work. And the answer is you don’t
know. So I’m gonna tell you: what you have to do is what you do. So you’ll always know what
you have to do because you’re doing what you’re doing. To do something you’re not doing:
that’s bad. If you do what you do it’ll all work out. One of the things that you are doing is think-
ing you have to stand up. That’s fi ne for you to think that. You wanna know why I think it’s
fi ne for him to think that? Because that’s what he’s thinking.
BLAKE
You’re right. At some point you broke through whatever was in the way and now you’re up
there doing what you are doing.
The game in The Forum is the evocation of the presence 
of Being, and The Forum leader’s opponent is the way of being
that we in the technological age have been born into (the way 
we wound up being). Clearly, there is a certain direction which 
must be maintained in The Forum dialogue if its purpose is
to be achieved. The maintenance of this direction in the face 
of participants’ resistance might appear, to the everyday
understanding, as motivated by a need on The Forum leader’s
part to win the game, so that The Forum’s perspective is shown 
to be the true one. However, accepted in The Forum is that The
Forum leader’s responsibility is maintaining the ontological 
character of the conversation. “My job,” said Erhard, “is to 
manage the dialogue.” This management is not a matter of 
winning, but of keeping the way in view. In a recent conversation 
with the authors, Erhard put it this way: “I used this way of 
speaking to deal with people who are resisting in order to resist, 
rather than functioning in a dialogue.”
Any discussion of dialogue as pedagogy must always consider 
the question of mutuality, and this is especially delicate when the
dialogue’s purpose is the presencing of Being. The Forum leaders’ 
rank in The Forum dialogue is given by their ability to listen to 
the conversation from a certain perspective. As Erhard told The 
Forum leaders, “You’ve got to know that an authentic dialogue is 
going to generate clarity. You’ve also got to watch you don’t get
hooked. What hooks [you] is when someone says something that
you think puts you at a disadvantage.” Being hooked, for a Forum
leader, means being drawn into argument or commiseration with
participants’ stories about their lives, rather than maintaining
the transformed perspective given by The Forum’s ontological
distinctions. It is The Forum leader’s job not to get hooked.
This balance between mutuality and directedness in an 
ontological dialogue is an important matter. Obviously, there is
a thrust to such a dialogue—a movement of the conversation in 
the direction of its ontological intention. In his dialogue with the
Japanese scholar in On the Way to Language, Heidegger points 
to the nature of true dialogue when he states that “we may

BLAKE (pausing)
It’s really hard for me not to be funny.
ERHARD
Yeah. You’re already always funny.
BLAKE
And I don’t want to be silly or you’re going to get mad at me. It’s just a temptation to always be
funny.
ERHARD
It’s the way you avoid dealing with what you don’t want to deal with, which is being anything 
but funny. That’s what you don’t want to deal with. You learned how to deal with being funny.
You got that down very well and the rest of it you’re a little nervous about. But you’re not ner-
vous about being funny, are you?
BLAKE
No.
ERHARD
And you’re not nervous about whatever your racket is either. You’re just nervous about the rest
of it. I know you don’t understand half of what we’re talking about, but that’s all right. Just the

BLAKE
I don’t want to be nervous anymore.
ERHARD

BLAKE
I’m not a dictator and so I have to live with the things I’m not comfortable with, and when I’m
uncomfortable, other people are uncomfortable. I don’t like that.
ERHARD
Thanks... The next subject. Everybody ready for the next subject?
A participant named Charles, who was still concerned with the conversation about the rain, rose.
CHARLES
I’m with “it rains so that life is sustained.”
confidently entrust ourselves to the hidden drift of our 
dialogue. . . as long as we remain inquirers” (“DL” in OWL 30,
emphasis added). In true dialogue—which always has an 
unspoken ontological intent—the dialogue itself can be trusted to 
move us along if we, as participants, continue to be a certain way. 
Notice the reflexive nature of the process: simultaneous surrender 
and evocation. In The Forum, the maintenance of this delicate 
balance is The Forum leader’s task.
A central element of The Forum’s effectiveness is the
inclusiveness of its conversation: interactions between The Forum 
leader and those participants who actively engage in the dialogue
are conducted in front of the entire group, so that even those 
participants who are listening and observing are able to derive 
the benefits of those interactions. 
For both Heidegger and Erhard, a shared tendency of human
being underlies all of our diverse individual and cultural concerns. 
The assumption of The Forum’s methodology is that a skillfully 
managed dialogue between two people can affect the ontological
insight of others who are listening to that dialogue, and who share
the tendency of being that generates it. 
A participant whose concern is her relationship with her 
employer can recognize, in another participant’s discussion of his 
problems with his mother, the same existential structure that is at 
the source of her own problem. Thus The Forum leader regularly 
exhorts participants to “listen from your own concerns.” ■

Forum Day One: Session One

ERHARD
What we were discussing is this in-order-to. I say the rain has no intention to do anything.
There’s nothing there that could intend. It just rains when it rains. There’s no intention in the
rain. Look, Charles, I’m doing something in the conversation which is designed to allow you to
take a look at your own beliefs. I’m asking questions which reduce your thesis to an absurdity.
If I ask if it rains in order to destroy life, you have to say yes if you believe that it rains in order
to sustain life, and so it makes you reexamine your theory. If you can consider the possibility 
that there is no intention in the rainstorm, then you are no longer stuck with what you used to 
believe.
CHARLES
I’ll keep looking at it.
ERHARD
We have to go quickly now or there won’t be any fi fth night. There’ll be a twelfth night. 
Someone raised a question about why participants were not allowed to take notes in The Forum, a policy 
that had been communicated when they registered for the course.
ERHARD
Because we don’t want you to retain information. So you don’t get stuck trying to remember 
something. You think Bjorn Borg remembers how to hold the tennis racket? This is no diff erent
than the conversation about the rainstorm.
(loudly)
You have this superstition that you do things because you remember how to do them! You don’t 
drive your car, play tennis, or live life powerfully and eff ectively out of anything you remember. 
If Joe Montana had to remember how to throw the football when he’s back in the pocket, he’d
get killed every Sunday.
A woman named Doris rose with a question about the rainstorm:
DORIS
What about the role of ultimate being in natural events?
ERHARD
I don’t like to discuss ultimate being with people who don’t know their ass from a hole in the 
ground.
DORIS
I fi nd that response pretty off ensive.

SPEAKING BEING
DORIS (stammering slightly) 
Are you inferring that I don’t . . .?
ERHARD
No.
(pausing) 
We don’t know yet. 
DORIS
I assure you I do. 
ERHARD
Really? We’ll see. You either do or you don’t, so there’s nothing to be nervous about. Then we 
could discuss ultimate being. 
(pausing)
I want you to get that I am not a guy in a diner.
He moved toward the back row where Doris was standing:
ERHARD (continuing) 
When I was growing up on the east coast, my family took trips to visit people. And we would 
drive home, oftentimes very late at night, oftentimes when it was raining or snowing or nasty. 
And diners, as far as I knew, were places where you stopped to get a cup of coff ee so you could
stay awake while you were driving. And at my age I couldn’t let anybody do anything without
my being there, so I always had to go in with them. And I learned about guys in diners. Guys in
diners, late at night like I’m describing to you, are usually fairly lonely, because they don’t have 
anybody to talk to. And they just love for somebody to stop in because then they’ve got some-
body to talk to. And you know, you go in, and you’re the only person there, and you sit up at the
counter, and you have your cup of coff ee and whatever else. And you fi nd out that this guy in 
the  diner—the guy behind the counter—knows everything about everything. There is nothing 
about which he does not know. He knows what the president ought to do about the defi cit, he 
knows what the country ought to do about international relationships, he knows what you 
ought to do about your marriage, he knows what kind of work you ought to do and how what-
ever kind of work you are doing how you could do it better, he knows something about every-
thing. Most people are like a guy in a diner. Goddamned near everybody knows everything 
about everything. So in here—at least in The Forum—I question everything. Everything—in-
cluding whether or not you know your ass from a hole in the ground. And whether anyone is
qualifi ed to discuss ultimate being. I didn’t say you weren’t. That’s the way I do The Forum.
(to Doris)
Okay? 
Being-in-the-world: Being-in
An important term that Werner Erhard often employs in his work, 
and one which is central in the thinking of Martin Heidegger is 
Being-in-the-world. To indicate clearly that a human being in his 
model of things is not a self-contained Cartesian subject, separate 
from an objective world “out there,” Heidegger never presents 
Dasein’s Being as disconnected, either from others or from the 
world. Dasein’s Being is Being-in-the-world. This indicates “a
unitary phenomenon” which “must be seen as a whole” (
y
BT 78).
T
However, while “Being-in-the-world cannot be broken up into 
contents which may be pieced together,” the constituent parts 
may be “brought out for emphasis.” One of these parts is Being-in.

Forum Day One: Session One 
21
DORIS 
Okay.
She sat. A man rose to object to Erhard’s earlier assertion that our ways of being, such as nervous-
ness, own us. 
FOSTER
I understand that being nervous is a human quality. Why don’t I own being nervous? Isn’t that 
a quality of me? 
ERHARD 
Where is this quality? 
FOSTER (pointing to his heart)
Here, and it’s pounding! 
ERHARD 
My dog’s heart pounds. You and I explain things about people by assigning qualities to them. 
But this may not be eff ective if what you want to do is have access to the things you’re explain-
ing. The language we use every day is designed to explain things. The language we use in here 
is designed to gain access to things. So it’s a diff erent language. Explanations give no access to
power. If you want power and access, we’re going to invent such a language in here. I’m not 
limited to merely reporting the way I am. I’m an anti-quality-ist. You ain’t got any qualities 
inside you. Qualities are an explanatory principle. It won’t hold up on closer examination. 
Erhard was now in the aisle, moving among the participants. One rose to defend the importance of 
having what he called self-beliefs.
RAY
How does one hold beliefs about oneself and about reality in a way to be powerful and creative?
ERHARD
One of the ways is to not have any beliefs. Does anyone need to believe that the fl oor is there? 
You don’t need to have any belief about the fl oor and it works just fi ne. And if you didn’t have 
any beliefs about gravity it would work just fi ne. You only need to believe in things that you 
doubt. The only problem with belief is that you can’t think about anything you believe.
k
RAY
I have an interpretation about myself, and how do I hold that interpretation?
ERHARD
As an interpretation.
Being-in articulates an essentially different relationship
from the one we usually have in mind when we say something is
“in” something. If we say “the water is in the glass,” for example, 
the two phenomena being related have a prior and individual 
existence in space: the water was there, and the glass was there. 
We have simply put one in the other. Further, as Heidegger points
out, we can easily extend such relationships outward: the glass is
on the table, the table is in the kitchen, the kitchen is in the house, 
and so on, until finally we can say that the water is in “world 
space” (BT 79).
T
Objects such as the glass and the table are, in Heidegger’s 
vocabulary, “things occurring ‘within’ the world” (BT 79).
T
Therefore they have a different kind of being from Dasein. The
table and the glass are whats; their characteristics are categorical.
While the table and the glass can have a location-relationship
within the world, the water is not in the glass in the same way that
a human being is in-the-world. 
Dasein, on the other hand, is a who, and its characteristics
are existential, which define an existence structure quite different
from that of a table. This is, of course, on one level obvious. 
But Heidegger, remember, is languaging a view of the world 
that is very different from our everyday way of understanding
things. Therefore he is rigorous in setting out the terminological 
differences between states of being.
A chair can be next to the wall, but the chair can never touch
the wall, “even if the space between them should be equal to
zero” (BT 81). Heidegger is not making a sensory distinction but 
T
an ontological one. To touch is to encounter meaningfully, and 
such meaningful encounters are possible only for entities with
meaning. In Heidegger’s vocabulary, a table and a chair are 
worldless.
Werner Erhard can be seen as distinguishing worldlessness 
early in The Forum, in his interactions with participants on the
subject of whether the rain falls in order to water the flowers. In 
doing so, he is beginning to create an understanding of meaning 
as a human characteristic, rather than an aspect of the things out
there in the world. This distinction will be further developed later

SPEAKING BEING
RAY
Thank you.
Shortly before the fi rst break of the morning, Erhard introduced a new topic: 
ERHARD
The next subject is the matter of your being here. At the upcoming break, you will be given an 
opportunity to leave and have your money refunded. You want to listen up! I’m going to give
you the opportunity not to be here. You shouldn’t be here if you didn’t put yourself here. The 
Forum won’t work for you anyhow, so you’re wasting your time here. You shouldn’t be here if 
you’re here because you were threatened. We don’t allow people to participate in The Forum
who were coerced or threatened. You may have been here on that basis up till now. You can 
leave now and you’ll get all your money back. And if you’ll get in trouble with whoever you’re
here for, I’ll write a note that says that you begged and pleaded and tried to stay here and I 
threw you out. If you’re here because you were pressured into being here, would you stand up 
please?
(one participant stood)
Anybody else?
(another long pause as another stood) 
I’m going to say “Anybody else?” fi ve more times.
Eventually several people stood in response to his request, and he began to interact with them
individually. The interactions varied strikingly in their tone. With the fi rst participant, a teenager 
named Kathy, Erhard’s manner was quite gentle. He moved closer to her, standing at a distance of 
about four feet. Before beginning the conversation, he asked her if she was willing to interact with 
him in front of the group, acknowledging that it might be “scary” for her to do so. He then reiterat-
ed his assertion that pressure, like embarrassment and hustle, was a clearing she was bringing to 
the circumstances:
ERHARD (continuing)
I know that if you’re here because somebody pressured you to be here, that that’s an issue in 
your life. The only people who experience being pressured about The Forum are those for 
whom pressure is an issue. I’m giving you the opportunity to make a choice. Now that I’ve
given you the choice, would you like to leave or would you like to be here? There will be no bad
results from you leaving. You’ll get your money back. 
KATHY 
That’s good. I feel like I have the opportunity to choose now, whereas, before, I didn’t feel like
that.
on the first day when participants’ stories about the events in 
their lives are distinguished from the events themselves.
Human beings exist in a world of meaning, and their 
relationship with that world is fundamental. In-ness is an aspect
of Dasein’s existence from the ground up. Consider: a human
being never exists as a (meaningful) human being until she exists
in-the-world, and when she leaves the world (dies), she ceases to
exist (as a human being). Heidegger’s German term for the Being-
in relationship (Sein bei) carries the implication of what we would
call being at home (BT 80, note 3). Dasein is at home in the world,
T
Being-with others. “Being-with” is examined in the first sidebar of 
Session One of Day Two, and we address the “world” of Being-in-
the-world at the beginning of Session One of Day Four. ■

ERHARD
I only do this work with people for whom it’s going to be successful, so I’m not willing to do 
this work except on the basis that people chose to be here. What’s your choice?
KATHY
I choose to be in The Forum. 
ERHARD
No coercion? That’s your choice? Made freely?
KATHY
Yes. 
ERHARD
Thank you for going through the process in front of all these people.
Along with Kathy, two other people sat down. The only participant who remained standing was a 
young man in the front row named Bill, who spoke as soon as an assistant got a microphone to him:
BILL (angrily)
I think there’s kind of a thin line between choice and being compelled to do something because
someone cared enough to continuously call me up and get me here.
ERHARD (moving in to a face-to-face stance with Bill)
You’re an asshole, and somebody...
BILL
Your language is bad.
ERHARD
It’s much worse than you think it is. You don’t want to fuck with me.
BILL
You don’t scare me.
ERHARD
You’re in my game, my friend, you don’t want to fuck with me.
BILL
Someone should use language to try to clear a point.
ERHARD
I understand what you believe. I’m not interested.

BILL
That’s quite obvious.
ERHARD
Now do you have something to say that’s thoughtful? Because I’m not interested in your beliefs.
BILL
You’re competing with me in your lack of thoughtfulness in the terminology that you use on a 
regular basis, my friend.
ERHARD
Really?
BILL
Yes. Thoughtfulness is as thoughtfulness does. To be thoughtful I would expect a mutual kind
of communication.
ERHARD
You got a mutual kind of communication. You got bullshit for bullshit.
BILL
Thank you very much. You are quite impressive.
ERHARD
Thank you. Are you here because you were pressured into being here?
BILL
I drove here.
ERHARD
I understand. Were you pressured into being here? I know you’re not here because you were 
pressured into being here. I can take one look at you and know that wasn’t true. I know you’re
up there to fuck with me.
BILL
Now...
ERHARD
Hold on, let me talk for a while. So you’re going to tell me the story about people called you a 
lot of times and people kept inviting you and kept saying you were supposed to. Understand? 
That’s the story you’re going to tell me and I already know the story. You won’t be the fi rst
person with that story. This is a story I’ve heard a lot of times. Now why was I bad with you 
MOOD
Heidegger’s masterwork, Being and Time, presents a model of 
human being that focuses on our lived, everyday experience. This
“average everydayness,” he says, has been generally disregarded
in attempts to understand our nature. It is so apparent and well-
known to us that we fail to recognize the ontological significance
of its elements. One of these elements is mood.
Mood, or state-of-mind (
d Befindlichkeit) is a manifestation of 
the moment-to-moment way one is automatically attuned to the 
world. My mood provides a context—a background environment—
in which I move; it pervades and colors my relationship to 
whatever I am up to at any moment, for instance, when Erhard 
says “your pessimism is you.” In bad moods, “Dasein becomes 
blind to itself” (BT 175). And while we may not notice it, says
T
Heidegger, a human being always has some mood, even when its 
specific nature is elusive: 
The pallid, evenly balanced lack of mood, 
which is oft en persistent and which is not to be 
mistaken for a bad mood, is far from nothing
at all. Rather, it is in this that Dasein becomes 
satiated with itself. Being has become
manifest as a burden. Why that should be, one
does not know.
w (BT 173) 
T
“
Furthermore, “when we master a mood, we do so by way
of a counter-mood; we are never free of moods” (BT 175). Mood
T
is the persistent background of our lives. Our moods come over 
us, and our cognition cannot reach their source: “The pure ‘that 
it is’ shows itself, but the ‘whence’ and the ‘whither’ remain in 
darkness” (BT 173).
T
This last point will be seen as significant as The Forum 
approaches its climax: we are always brought before ourselves

just now? Because I want to get this story up. There’s a lot of people with that story here and
I want to get that story killed. I got people’s attention here. I got your attention too, but more
important: I got their attention.
(to the group)
I know you’ve got a story about how you got here. That’s your story. I don’t know what the truth 
is. I know Bill was a pain in the ass.
BILL
Thank you.
ERHARD
You were, and you probably are most of the time. Do other people in here know you?
BILL
I’m not sure.
ERHARD
If I had a group of your friends here and asked them, “can Bill be a real pain in the ass?” what 
would they say? 
BILL 
Well I imagine if they pushed me to extremes...
(laughter)
ERHARD (shaking his head)
Wait, wait. That’s not what I mean. I mean, if I said to your friends, “can Bill be a real pain in
the ass?” what would they say? I would bet they would say “yes.” More than infrequently.
BILL
What about your friends?
ERHARD
Let me explain something to you.
BILL
You put me on the spot, why can’t I put you on the spot?
ERHARD
I didn’t pay to be in here, you did. Because you invested $625 to come to my seminar. But if I
leave here and I’m still an asshole, I didn’t lose anything. If you’ve got a seminar that keeps you 
in our moods, but we tend to turn away from what they might 
reveal. In moods, we find ourselves, but “in a way of finding which 
arises not so much from a direct seeking as rather from a fleeing”
(BT 174). In our assured, everyday way of speaking, we dismiss
T
a state-of-mind, or rather, an attunement, as “just a mood I’m 
in.” But in doing so, we evade a more primordial disclosure, an
understanding which stares us in the face “with the inexorability
of an enigma” (BT 175). 
T
At this early point in the proceedings, Erhard is making two 
important moves. First, he is suggesting to the participants that
the nature of their moods is not what they have taken them to
be. They are not a product of the circumstances, but are instead 
an aspect of their own way of being. Second, he is urging the
participants not to attempt to avoid or transcend their moods,
however uncomfortable they may seem, but rather to allow them,
and to bring them into The Forum so that they can be part of the 
process. As The Forum proceeds, these suggestions will be seen
as crucial to the development of the ontological dialogue. ■

BILL
You know I have to say something. The only value I’ve gotten so far is entertainment from your 
cynicism.
ERHARD
You remember when I said you would be sitting there with your judgments and assessments?
BILL
Believe me, I’m here with an open mind.
This interaction, which was in its early moments the most belligerent of the entire four days, grad-
ually became playful. Bill began to smile, and the dialogue assumed the character of good-natured
sparring.
ERHARD
Back to the issue of pressure. Did you get a lot of phone calls?
BILL
From one lady in particular. During the process I was trying to prospect her into something 
and in the end she prospected me into something.
(laughter)
ERHARD
I’m not going to ask what you were prospecting her into. But at any rate there was a lady who
called you a number of times.
BILL
She’s married, Werner.
ERHARD
It’s hard to have this conversation with you with your foot nailed to the fl oor. How many times
did she call?
BILL
I don’t know. A half dozen to a dozen times. Perhaps more.

No.
ERHARD
So you never told her “no,” right?
BILL
Never directly “no.”
ERHARD (turning to the group)
I’m revealing the nature of pressure. That’s what Bill and I are having this conversation
about. Nobody does The Forum because they were pressured into it.
(Erhard placed his hands on Bill’s head and pushed down)
That’s what pressure is. But what had the people from the Center done? They called you. They 
spoke to you. What else did they do? They stayed engaged in the conversation with you because
you never said no.
BILL
They called me every day. 
ERHARD
Every day?

Well, maybe every other day.

You all have a story, and your story is as full of shit as Bill’s. And I’m using language that’s

Hesitantly, Bill sat down.
ERHARD
Do I take that to mean that you’ve chosen to be here?
BILL
Yes. 
ERHARD (to the group)
All Bill’s doing is doing you a favor. He’s letting you see yourself. That’s an extraordinary gift, 
to see yourself.
(turning back to Bill)
I want to apologize to you for saying things that you found off ensive. Do you accept my 
apology?
BILL
Yes, I do. 
ERHARD 
I’m not clear you’re here because you chose to be here.
BILL 
Yes. But I’m not clear if I’ll get the results.
 ERHARD
And you won’t be. How The Forum works is you learn nothing. And then you learn more noth-
ing. And then you learn it all at once. It’s an all of a sudden phenomenon. 
(pausing) 
What we just went through is very important. I brought something to that conversation that’s 
designed to leave you in a diff erent place about those conversations. I predict that when The
Forum is over you’ll tell me this was the most important experience in your whole life. We’ll
see. There’s a bit of a risk here, and I accept that.
Erhard fi nally left Bill, and addressed the group, moving among them.
ERHARD
Nobody participates in programs that I lead because they were pressured. A lot of people are 
here because they’ve got reasons to be here. And I want you to know you’re not here because 
of your reasons. You put yourself in that chair, and not your reasons. You’ve got a story called
force, and what actually happened was somebody spoke to you. If you live in a story called 
force, your life will look like a response to force. See, most of you live in response to a story you 
made up. You live in a sea of reasons. But I want you to be clear, you put yourself in that chair,
“
 If you live in a story called force, your life
will look like a response to force.

not the reasons, nobody else and nothing else. And you have reasons. That’s what I mean by 
people don’t know their ass from a hole in the ground. People don’t know what put them in that
chair. If you’re stuck with this idea that you were pressured, I want you out of here. I’m going 
to say a lot of things in here and you’re only going to get them almost. I know that today you’re
going to get almost nothing I say, because you’re going to put it in the language in which you
dwell. Like “should.” I don’t dwell in the language of should. It’s patently obvious here. I’m 
asking you who’s buried in Grant’s Tomb. This is not hard. You put yourself here.
A participant raised a question about a friend he wanted to do The Forum. He described the man.
PARTICIPANT
Would he feel pressured? 
ERHARD
Yeah, because he’s an asshole.
PARTICIPANT (laughs)
Yeah, that’s true.
ERHARD
You see, you can’t pressure people who are straight. They give clear answers, like “no,” or 
“don’t call me.” I invite people. I want to be clear what I mean by an invitation. An invitation
for me always carries with it the power to decline.
Erhard mounted the platform, and announced a break. However, he said, “in The Forum there are 
no breaks,” so he gave the participants an assignment.
ERHARD
The assignment during the break is to sort out your “story” from “what happened.” Most people 
live in the story and don’t live in the what happened. And there’s something disempowering 
about living in the story instead of living in the what happened. The problem is that you are 
thrown—that’s like already always—you are thrown to the story. You are addicted to the story.
“People don’t like me” and “being insulted” never happen. I’m going to demonstrate insulting. 
I’m going to insult you: I insult you. For the fi rst time in your life you’ve now been insulted as a

Forum Day One: Session One

After Erhard left the room, Julie requested that due to the size of the group all participants should
be respectful of the hotel. She pointed out the assistants who could direct participants to pay phones
and bathrooms. “We request that you don’t eat on this break,” she said. “If you must eat for medical
reasons, please see Wes,” one of the two Forum leaders who were assisting Erhard. Finally she in-
troduced the other four Forum supervisors who were working with her, and who were available to
answer their questions. Finally, as she would before every break, she read the names of participants
who had received telephone messages during the session.
The Forum adjourned for a break at 12:40 pm.

SPEAKING BEING
Hints: Ontological Distinctions
The Forum achieves its result through the development in dialogue of what Werner 
Erhard calls distinctions. In traditional education, based in an epistemological model 
in which the goal is to increase or enhance what is known, information—concepts, 
ideas, processes—are communicated through definition and explanation. The Fo-
rum, however, develops an ontological model of education, in which the goal is not 
an increase in knowledge but an experience of Being. In this model, the elements of 
the course content are distinguished. 
The nature of distinctions will be addressed at length by Erhard later in The 
Forum. But here, early on the first morning, the development of distinctions is al-
ready under way. Erhard is beginning to employ an aspect of his methodology that, 
according to Martin Heidegger, is central to ontological communication: the use of 
hints to communicate what cannot directly be spoken, thereby providing access to 
the content as lived rather than as merely understood. 
Heidegger introduced the idea of hinting as a way of communicating Being in 
his 1959 essay, “A Dialogue on Language” (in OWL), which provides an account of 
his conversation with a Japanese scholar who shared his interest in ontological 
inquiry. The interaction, presented in the form of a transcript, occurs as a stately 
conversational dance, a linguistic minuet. Each move is made with great care, so the 
interaction proceeds at times with excruciating deliberateness. At one point Heide-
gger (referred to in the account as the Inquirer) poses a question—“Do you have in 
your language a word for what we call language?”—to which the scholar arrives at 
a tentative answer only after twenty-three pages of thoughtful circumnavigation in 
and around the topic. 
In response to a remark by the Japanese about language’s “essential being,” 
Heidegger refers to his often-quoted characterization of language as “the house of 
Being.” The phrase, he says, “gives a hint of the nature of language” (“DL” in OWL 
26). As the two men’s dialogue continues, the extraordinary attentiveness given 
to each word reveals a respect for the nature of hints. Hints, Heidegger observes, 
“belong to an entirely different realm of reality. . . . They are enigmatic. They beckon 
to us. They beckon away. They beckon us toward that from which they unexpectedly 
bear themselves toward us” (“DL” in OWL 26).
In his conversation with the Japanese scholar, Heidegger is distinguishing 
hinting, which is to say that he is hinting at the nature of hints. The Forum’s develop-
ment of distinctions is likewise a process of hinting. 
SESSION ONE INTERVAL
In hinting, words are spoken in such a way that “each word in each case is 
given its full—most often hidden—weight” (“DL” in OWL 31). What is not spoken, but 
communicated in the background, is allowed to reverberate. In this way a space is 
allowed to develop around each utterance:
[Inquirer]: Hints need the widest sphere in which to swing. . .
[Japanese]: . . . where mortals go to and fro only slowly.
[Inquirer]: This is what our language calls “hesitate.” It is done 
truly when slowness rests on shy reverence. And so I do not wish to 
disturb your hesitation by urging you on too rashly.
[Japanese]: You are more helpful to me in my attempt to say the 
word than you can know. (“DL” in OWL 27–28)
Further, although each distinction has a rubric for its topic—in this dialogue, the 
topic is the nature of language—in developing distinctions the aim is not to arrive at 
a correct verbal articulation of the rubric. On the contrary, the goal is to avoid such a 
resolution:
[Japanese]: We Japanese do not think it strange if a dialogue 
leaves undefined what is really intended, or even restores it 
back to the keeping of the undefinable.
[Inquirer]: That is part, I believe, of every dialogue that 
has turned out well between thinking beings. As if of its own 
accord, it can take care that that undefinable something not 
only does not slip away, but displays its gathering force ever 
more luminously in the course of the dialogue. (“DL” in OWL 13)
In this conversation, Heidegger and the Japanese scholar may be seen as 
enacting the methodology of The Forum: the dialogic development of distinctions 
through a process of hinting. Being cannot be verbalized. Being is in language, but 
it is not in the words that are spoken. It lives in the unspoken background, and in 
a conversation for Being, that background must be made present. Hints are an 
appropriate form for bringing a background to presence because they direct our 
attention toward something we had not noticed, something which they at the same 
time bring forward to meet us. 
Ontological hinting is not an easy form of communication to master, and by 
characterizing it here as an element of The Forum’s “methodology,” we have fallen 
prey to one of its pitfalls. When Heidegger says to the Japanese scholar that calling

language “the house of Being” gives a “hint of the nature of language,” the scholar 
immediately recognizes the danger: “I fear that to call your ‘house of Being’ a hint 
might tempt you and me to elaborate the notion of hinting into a guiding concept in 
which we then bundle up everything” (“DL” in OWL).  Heidegger concurs, but adds 
that this error can “never be prevented in the sense of being totally excluded,” since 
“the mode of conceptual representation insinuates itself all too easily into every 
kind of human experience” (“DL” in OWL 25). 
A relevant observation by the senior author: during my years of participation in 
Erhard’s work, the distinguishing of distinctions has remained a source of fascina-
tion, challenge, and even mystery for me. I have observed conversations between 
Forum leaders—people for whom the development of distinctions is central to their 
professional practice—in which the speaking occurred to me as a kind of short-
hand. Elements of everyday interaction—details,  transitions, connections—seemed 
to be missing. On one occasion, a statement by one Forum leader elicited this re-
sponse from another: “You’re explaining it. Distinguish it.” I found myself struggling 
to recognize the difference being referred to. 
An extensive hint at the nature of distinctions is found in Heidegger’s later work, 
where he turned his attention increasingly to the ontological possibilities of art, and 
specifically of poetry. Poetry, he said, is projective saying—that is, a kind of saying 
which projects a clearing for Being by speaking the unspoken. “Projective saying 
is saying which, in preparing the sayable, simultaneously brings the unsayable as 
such into a world” (“OWA” in PLT 71). But such saying is not limited to the speaking 
of the poet, because “Language itself is poetry in the essential sense” (“OWA” in PLT 
72). Indeed, “everyday language is a forgotten and used-up poem, from which there 
hardly resounds a call any longer” (“L” in PLT 205). 
The thinker, says Heidegger elsewhere, confines his thinking to a single 
thought (PLT 4). Heidegger’s single thought was the question of Being. A similar 
single-mindedness characterizes the poet, and so Heidegger’s description of the 
poet’s relation to the unsayable is useful:
Every great poet creates his poetry out of one single 
poetic statement only. . . . The poet’s statement remains 
unspoken. None of his individual poems, nor their totality, 
says it all. Nonetheless, every poem speaks from the whole 
of the one single statement, and in each instance says that 
statement. (“LP” in OWL 160)
“
Therefore all of Heidegger’s writing and all of Werner Erhard’s work, as well as all the 
poetry of Dickinson or Rilke or Wallace Stevens, may be seen as bodies of hints for 
the Saying of what is essentially unsayable.

SPEAKING BEING
During the forty-minute break, statements had been written on two of the chalkboards. On one: 
“Promise of The Forum: You can have anything out of The Forum that you are willing to stand for 
having gotten.” On the second: “The commitment of the work is Transformation: bringing forth a 
breakthrough in the possibility of being for human beings.”
As The Forum resumed, Erhard began with a question.
ERHARD
What happened when you were considering the diff erence between your story and what hap-
pened?
PARTICIPANT
I found that I didn’t want to confront my stories.
ERHARD
It’s possible to live in a kind of unconsciousness that we don’t ordinarily call unconsciousness
because we’re not knocked out. It’s an unconsciousness which appears as not being there. What 
you can’t be with prevents you from being. If you mash up the what happens and the story, it
kind of keeps you a little unconscious, because you don’t have to be with it. But when you start
to distinguish the story from what happened, you begin to see the story as a story, and it’s not 
very attractive that way, is it? And it’s something one would mostly avoid being with. There
will be a lot that will come up in here that you don’t want to be with. It’s useful to be with what
you don’t want to be with. What you’ve already learned to be with and survive with--that’s not 
going to be very useful in here, it’s the part you’ve avoided being with here. Anything else?
Thanks very much.
As participants responded to this question, Erhard contextualized their contributions by expanding
the distinctions he had introduced earlier in the day. 
JOHN
I’ve never really liked my wife’s version of the story of how we got married.
ERHARD
When you can recognize a person’s story as their story, you begin to have access to their version 
of the story, so that you’re not stuck with, you don’t have to resign yourself to, their version of 
the story. You have access to diff erent possibilities within the story, but not when it’s mashed up 
with what happened.
JOHN
I got so upset, I left the room, and while I heard the story from another part of the house, my 
upset turned toward wanting to get out of my marriage.
ERHARD  (interrupting)
You didn’t invent thinking about getting out of your marriage. That’s already always in the cul-
ture of being for human beings. You think, “oh well, this happened and that made me think I

Philosophy as Rhetorical Evocation
We propose that The Forum is an instance of ontological 
rhetoric. We emphasize at the outset that this is not the everyday 
understanding of rhetoric as “mere rhetoric,” that is, language that 
is superficial and disconnected from serious purposes. Rhetoric as 
we use the term is any use of language that is intended to produce 
a real-world result. Ontological rhetoric communicates in the 
unspoken realm of language to provide its listeners with access to 
the realm of Being. 
Recognition of the value and function of ontological 
rhetoric is found in the later writing of Henry W. Johnstone, 
Jr., founder of the journal, Philosophy and Rhetoric. Early in his 
career, Johnstone believed that the role of the philosophical 
rhetor was “to treat his audience as an object,” and that his goal 
should quit or leave.” That’s not the way it works. It’s a rainstorm. Leaving, getting out of things,
quitting—owns your life. It’s true you have the conversation with yourself personally. But that’s 
like getting wet in a rainstorm.
(with emphasis)
I’m not thinking that. That is thinking me.
(pausing)
I’m starting to talk like people don’t talk, because I want access to what concerns me that
people don’t have. So you and I are starting to invent a language that gives us access to the
things that are interesting, or important, that concern us in life. It’s not your thought. I want 
you to start to think that it thinks you. You have the thoughts like you get wet in the rain-
storm. I’m just asking you to begin to think in a way you haven’t thought before. The kind of 
person you are is given by that thinking, which isn’t your thoughts or your thinking.
JOHN
What I noticed was that each of us have diff erent stories about how we got together.
ERHARD
You can’t ask questions like “True?” about people’s stories. There’s no such thing as “true
”
stories.” “True” and “story” don’t go together. A story’s a story. People get into trouble in life
because they start believing their stories. Even worse, you start believing someone else’s story—
makes you a spear-carrier in somebody else’s opera. This is not a good way to live.
JOHN
We did what we did and got married.
ERHARD
Who is not clear about choosing to be married? The conversation about why you’re in The 
Forum could apply as well to you in your job, or your marriage. Almost nobody thinks they 
are anyplace because they put themselves there. But everybody puts themselves there. Then
you get the story about why you’re there. There’s no power in the story... You live in a story 
about being married. I accuse you that you live in a story about being married, and the 
quality of being married reflects that it in part is generated by a story. I didn’t say you don’t
have a good marriage. But it’s limited to a certain box, a certain space or quality, when it’s a 
story. What happened? You got married. Then there’s this whole story. And they’re distinct
from one another. The same thing is true about everything in life. See, you and I have the 
kind of lives that people would have if they lived out of a story. And mostly the story is 
constituted mostly by your reasons. But you got that job. That’s what happened.
JOHN
Normally I know that, but I wasn’t clear about that last night. It’s so easy to forget.

SPEAKING BEING
was “to manipulate his audience so as to secure agreement” 
(“Persuasion” 19). But a “turn” in Johnstone’s thinking led him 
to acknowledge by 1978 that “the distinction between finding 
the truth in philosophy and finding the proper rhetorical devices 
for propagating it cannot be maintained” (“Truth” 74). In other 
words, “truth” is always and already rhetorical, never severed 
from its communication, and thus finding the “truth” requires 
holding up a pretense that rhetoric is merely a convenient 
accessory that can be dispensed with.
 Johnstone’s new perspective of the philosophy–rhetoric 
relationship was based in the concept of evocation: “My present 
view is that a successful argument in philosophy is one that is 
intended to evoke, and does evoke, a response of a certain kind 
in the man to whom it is addressed” (“Truth” 75). Johnstone cited 
Heidegger as evidence for this view, and his description here of 
Heidegger’s language use is consistent with our understanding of 
both Heidegger’s and Erhard’s thinking:
ERHARD
That’s why we don’t give you anything to remember. You just have to be.
HANNAH
There’s a new babysitter watching the baby while I’m here and I got a note at the break to call
and I immediately felt terror because six months ago there was an accident that threatened his
life.
ERHARD
You understand that the terror is of no value to her? You sympathize with the terror. When you
leave here you’ll be a little more ruthless than you are now. You’ll be concerned for what em-
powers people, not for sympathizing with their weaknesses. No empowerment in terror.
HANNAH
I had lost closeness with him. It was more about clinging, and I saw that it was more about
terror.
ERHARD
Major issues like parenting or confronting death generate the most persistent stories. The things 
that are real close to us are hard not to be stupid about. It’s hard to be with that people do die.
And you are going to die. And that’s hard to be with. The more dramatic the soap opera is the
easier it is to get drawn into it and not be able to distinguish the story from what happened.
MAX
I’m here because I want my life to stop being an emergency, in my personal and professional 
life. I am an upset waiting to happen.
ERHARD
Some of you are an argument waiting to happen. You’re waiting for the occasion to act out the 
argument.
MAX
Turning away from my story to what happened is like becoming an arbitrator. It helps me get 
away from my guilt.
ERHARD
If guilt were useful, I would say have a lot of it. Listen up here! This is another one of those 
things you want to get. Feeling guilty makes it all right that you did something. If you didn’t feel 
guilty you’d be a bad person. That’s not terrible to be a bad person. No, it’s all right to do some-
thing as long as you feel guilty about it. Guilt is the salve we put on something that we did so
that we don’t have to be responsible for it. But you don’t know what I’m talking about because
you don’t know the diff erence between guilt and responsibility at this point. Max?
If I am correct in arguing that Heidegger 
conceives philosophy as basically rhetorical, 
some revision in our conception of rhetoric 
is called for. . . its purpose is not to incite its 
hearer to action—even the action of adopting 
some specific belief. Instead, rhetoric totally 
reorients the hearer; if he listens to it he is in 
a position to abandon an inauthentic life in 
favor of an authentic one. (“Rhetoric” 68)
“
On this view, the truth of philosophy is intimately infused with 
its communicability: “discovery, communication, and rhetoric all 
collapse into a unitary philosophical act” (“Truth” 76). Further, 
communicability is manifested as evocation: “The only way to tell 
whether what I have is a truth or a falsehood,” said Johnstone, “is 
to contemplate its evocative power.” And rhetoric, he added, is “the 
art of evocation” (“Truth” 76).
Finally, Johnstone’s discussion of Heidegger raises a third issue 
which will be particularly relevant in our analysis of The Forum: that 
is the question of the appropriate rhetorical style for addressing an

MAX
The story is that I joined the service, and went to Vietnam. And my welcome home isn’t what
I expected. What happened was, I went to war and came back alive. Same as any other war, 
there’s...it’s cleared up a lot of issues to look at it as what happened rather than my story in
relation to my coming home.
ERHARD (with emphasis)
Listen up! Vietnam’s a great, great story. Lot of people badly, badly fucked up by the story. Notice 
I didn’t say by what happened? Lots of people profoundly disabled by the story. Lot of freedom
for people to start to distinguish the story from what happened. Thanks Max.
Erhard shifted his tone, calling attention to the process they had been engaged in: they had devel-
oped a number of distinctions as tools for their inquiry.
ERHARD
We’re going to get these tools sharpened up as we proceed. Your questions are useful. You notice 
I’ve done most of what I’ve done out of people’s speaking. This is not a lecture, that’s why we 
call it The Forum. This is a dialogue. My job is to manage the dialogue, not to lecture. I have 
no pipeline to the truth. No one is asking you to believe anything that is said in here. But I’m 
asking you to think about it. That’s diff erent from “reject” or “accept” it. Instead, see what the
world looks like standing in that idea. It doesn’t matter whether you agree or not. To tell the
truth, I’m not that impressed with you yet, to care whether you agree or not. I do want to hear 
what you have to say. I’m not interested in your agreement or approval, or endorsement. I am
interested in you looking at what we’re saying here, to think about it yourself. And the way I’d 
like you to do that is to not judge it or evaluate it to see if it fi ts with what you already think. If 
I say anything that fi ts with what you already think, you shouldn’t be here. You can forget all 
that. Anything I say that fi ts with what you already think: that’s not The Forum. Only what I
say that doesn’t fi t with the stuff  you think, that provokes you to think and see things in a new 
way: that’s what’s valuable. But this isn’t the truth either. I don’t know about the truth. I know 
how to talk so that people have new possibility in their life. If you talk with me, you can bet that 
you’ll walk away with a new possibility in your life.
Now he introduced a new way to address what has already been the subject of the discussion.
ERHARD (continuing)
We’re going to talk about existence. That’s what we’ve been talking about. It’s hard to talk about. 
It’s hard to pick yourself up by your own bootstraps. It’s got to exist to talk about it. If you’re go-
ing to question existence—talk about existence—it’s got to exist to talk about it. The word for a 
concern for existence is ontology. And the reason I bring up that fancy sounding word is I want 
you to know The Forum is not psychological. Most people can’t tell the diff erence. Psychology 
is pervasive in our culture. The structure for interpretation for most people in this culture is psy-
chological. We’re all amateur psychologists. You see everything through a psychological lens.
untransformed audience whom one intends, through one’s rhetorical 
transactions, to transform. Johnstone stated the problem this way:
Heidegger’s entire position is specifically 
committed to the task of awakening phi-
listines from their ontological slumber 
. . . . Das Man [the “they,” the philistine, the 
untransformed] expects to be told in plain En-
glish what he can in fact come to understand 
only by being awakened. But because Heide-
gger’s entire thrust is toward the awakening 
of das Man he cannot reject as a mere philis-
tine the man who fails to understand him. In 
Heidegger’s own terms, he is not successful 
until he has reached the philistine. Hence in 
a sense there are no philistines at all for him. 
(“Rhetoric” 68) 
“
How does one awaken people from a debilitating slumber if 
they resist the process which is necessary for their awakening? 
This question, as we will show, is a central one for the rhetorical 
process of The Forum. ■
“ 
Only what I say that doesn’t fit with stuff  
you think, that provokes you to think and 
see things in a new way: that’s what’s
valuable.

ERHARD (pausing to wake a participant who was nodding off ) 
It’s okay to sleep in here if you can do it bolt upright with your eyes open. 
(returning to his topic)
Ontology is the diff erence between knowing how to play tennis and being a tennis player. They 
don’t teach this in school for the most part, and when they do, they do it badly for the most part.
An ontological approach—that is to say, a concern-for-being approach—has got a lot of room in
it because it’s something we haven’t engaged in very much. The point is, there’s a lot of room 
in a new realm. The psychological approach is one we’ve pushed really hard. And I want to be 
clear I’m not denigrating it. And that’s not our approach.
(moving to one of the blackboards) 
So far, we’ve distinguished two realms of existence. A phenomenon can exist in the realm of 
story and it can exist in the realm of what happened.
Erhard drew two circles on the board: in the left circle he wrote the word  “Story,” and in the right he
wrote “What Happened.”
ERHARD (indicating the left circle)
Max gave us a good example. There’s the story of Vietnam and that’s here. And there’s what
happened, and that’s here.
(indicating the right circle in which he wrote “what happened”)
We’re going to see what happens when you begin to distinguish these two. You’re going to see
the impact it has on your ability and state of being to distinguish Vietnam “the story” and Viet-
nam “the what happened.” You can apply the demonstration anywhere. We need to talk about 
thinking. Listen up. This is hard. Human beings have the notion that they think. Or—I might 
as well introduce this—they are that they think. They be like they’re thinking. And there is 
something happening. You and I call that “I think.” Here’s an exercise to tell if you’re thinking.
I’m going to shut up and you’re going to stop thinking.
(pausing for about fi fteen seconds)
You didn’t make it, did you? Nobody ever does, because it’s not you thinking. If you were
thinking then you could stop thinking. It is thinking, and you are having the thoughts it thinks.
t
Which is true? The old way of saying it or the way I said it? That’s not the point. I told you,
I don’t know the truth. I’m saying there’s something empowering about this, in the recogni-
tion that you don’t think. Like: “Hmm. I’m not thinking. It’s thinking, and I’m having those 
thoughts.” What comes up when you think this way is the possibility of actually thinking. 
Thinking is a process independent of those thoughts. Thinking is something like sitting with,
or more precisely something like dwelling in. It’s not like fi guring it out. You see, I asked you to
g
dwell in the possibility that it’s not you thinking.
(pausing again to address a number of people in the room who were getting sleepy) 
It always happens about now. Thinking about thinking puts you to sleep. Thinking wakes you
g
up. Thinking is when you have to break your mind—though not all of that is thinking. Some of 
it is bullshit.
“ 
It is thinking, and you are having the thoughts
t
it thinks. . . . Thinking is something like
sitting with, or more precisely something like
dwelling in. It’s not like figuring it out.

Forum Day One: Session Two
39
(turning to The Forum Supervisor) 
Julie, would you ask Eric to get the Heidegger books out of my room.
(returning to the blackboard, and pointing to the circle labeled “story”)
I want to take back making this bad. What’s disempowering is not the story, what’s disempow-
ering is when you collapse “what happened” with the “story” and you can’t distinguish the story 
from what happened. You can’t distinguish because you’ve got this mush, this mess, this swamp
of what happened and the story mixed together. The two need to be distinct. What does distinct 
mean? It means existing then on their own, being there of themselves. It’s possible for Vietnam 
to exist as a story and it’s possible for Vietnam to exist as a what happened. They’re two distinct 
realms of existence. Sometimes the story is appropriate, sometimes what happened is appropri-
ate. What’s never appropriate is when these two distinctions get collapsed.
As this conversation developed, Erhard added other terms to his blackboard model. In the right
circle, below “what happened,” he wrote “presence” and “I’m late.” In the other, below “story,” was 
written “concept” and “reasons.”
ERHARD
Confusing what happened with your story about it is like ordering steak and then mixing the
steak with the menu. Most people think life is sour because they’ve been eating the menu for 
so long, they don’t recognize reading the menu. You should not say “I love you” to people. You 
should say, “I live with the concept ‘I love you.’” Love as a concept is sometimes important, but
t
it isn’t the same as love as a presence. What falls out of my mouth when I say “chair” is a con-
cept. It’s not a chair—but it’s useful. Just separating the two domains of existence in any area of 
your life will leave you with more power in that area. For this to work, try it on in your own life. 
This is not the truth. Try it on. If it works, good; if not, throw it away.
At this point, The Forum Supervisor brought Erhard a copy of Heidegger’s What is Called Thinking? 
(1968, pages 76-77). He spent a minute looking for the passage he wanted, and fi nally turned back 
to her.
ERHARD
This is the wrong copy. This is not the copy I can fi nd things in. I have two marked copies and I 
can fi nd things in one and not the other.
Julie brought up the correct copy.
ERHARD (beginning to read)
“People still hold the view that what is handed down to us by tradition is what in reality lies 
behind us—while in fact it comes toward us because we are its captives and destined to it.”
(pausing)
We think we’re out in front of tradition on the leading edge. He’s talking about where the rub-
ber meets the road. This is not some fancy talk.

He’s talking about your future. He’s saying you’ve got no future. Your future is constituted by 
the past. Listen up! This is not a guy in a diner, by the way.
(shifting tone)
Where’s the person I had that conversation with?
Doris, with whom he had earlier discussed whether she knew her “ass from a hole in the ground,” 
stood.
ERHARD
Did I leave you insulted, by the way?
(Doris looking hesitant) 
Can I withdraw the insult? Will you forgive me? 
(nodding, she then sits)
Thank you.
(continuing to read)
“The purely historical view of tradition and the course of history is one of those vast self-de-
ceptions in which we must remain entangled as long as we are still not really thinking. That
self-deception about history prevents us from hearing the language of the thinkers. We do not 
hear it rightly, because we take that language to be mere expression, setting forth philosophers’
views.”
(to the group)
Some people are actually thinking, and speaking their thinking. That’s diff erent from “saying 
g
what you’ve got on your mind.” But the thinkers’ language tells what it is. And hearing it is in
no case easy. Hearing it presupposes that we meet a certain requirement, and we do so only on
rare occasions. So there’s a requirement to be able to hear thinking. And you can bet your hat, 
ass, and overcoat that the same requirement exists for thinking. And here’s the requirement.
(continuing to read)
“We must acknowledge and respect it. To acknowledge and respect consists in letting ev-
ery thinker’s thought come to us as something in each case unique, never to be repeated,
inexhaustible.”
(to the group)
You will notice that everything that has been said in here today you have associated with
something else. In order to have it live by itself, you have to think. Association happens anyhow,
because you’re not doing it. It’s doing it.

“—and being shaken to the depths by what is unthought in his thought.”
(to the group)
It’s like what is unsaid, but there by virtue of what is said. Anything that’s going to make a dif-
ference will be unsaid. Did you ever care about speaking in such a way that what you didn’t say 
was present? Probably not. But that’s where making a diff erence lies. 
(continuing to read)
“What is unthought in a thinker’s thought is not a lack inherent in his thought. What is un-
thought is there in each case only as the un-thought. The more original the thinking, the richer
will be what is unthought in it. The unthought is the greatest gift that thinking can bestow.”
(to the group)
Listen up real good to this part!
(continuing to read)
“But to the commonplaces of sound common sense, what is unthought in any thinking always 
remains merely the incomprehensible. And to the common comprehension, the incompre-
hensible is never an occasion to stop and look at its own powers of comprehension, still less to 
notice their limitations. To the common comprehension, what is incomprehensible remains 
forever merely off ensive...”
(to the group)
Where Heidegger uses the word “off ensive,” I say “it’s bullshit.” It’s a little clearer the way I say 
it, isn’t it? It’s more rigorous the way he says it, but it’s a little easier to get the way I say it.
(continuing to read)
“—proof enough to such comprehension, which is convinced it was born comprehending
everything, that it is now being imposed upon with an untruth and a sham. The one thing of 
which sound common sense is least capable is acknowledgment and respect.”
(to the group)
The distinction I’m developing between the story and what happened is not the commonsense
understanding. Love as a concept is what you and I live with most of the time, not love as a
presence. If you uncollapse the domains, you can have presence and story. It’s not worth a 
damn if you don’t map it onto your own life. Take something you’re concerned about—and by 
concern I don’t mean something you’re worried about. Take something you care about.
As the time for the second break of the day approached, Erhard moved to  another topic.
ERHARD (continuing)
We’re now going to talk about promises. There are certain promises you must make in order 
to participate in The Forum. You didn’t know that. This is a change! An occasion for upset! It’s 
very hard to talk about promises to people who don’t know what a promise is. Who you are is a 
“ 
Did you ever care about speaking in such a
way that what you didn’t say was present?
Probably not. But that’s where making a
diff erence lies.

If justifi cation equals doing it, when you don’t have a justifi cation for not doing it, then you
have to do it.

That’s a little sophisticated for us today.

ERHARD
You do what you feel like, or what is convenient, but you justify it so you can be right.

Diogenes looked for an honest man. I want to fi nd someone who is late. I’m fi fty-four years old 
and I’ve never found anyone who’s just late. It’s always “I’m late” plus the reason. By the way,
(pointing to the “what happened” circle) 
here’s “I’m late”...
(pointing to the “story” circle) 
...and here’s the reason. Being late is in a totally diff erent realm than the reason for being late.
And the two are not related. “I’m late” and the reasons arise in diff erent realms of existence. 
They’re apples and oranges. They don’t go together.

ERHARD
I apologize.
PARTICIPANT
Yeah, sure.
ERHARD
Is that like “fuck you”? Do you mean “I don’t feel apologize”? I’m not my feelings. I’m my 
mouth. You’re not your mouth. You say “okay” when you mean “Fuck you.”
PARTICIPANT
Not always.
ERHARD
You did that time.
PARTICIPANT 
That’s true.
Throughout this interaction Erhard’s style was relaxed but direct.
ERHARD (to the group)
The truth is that whether you keep your word depends on how you feel. Create this possibility: 
that you present yourself as someone who keeps your word, but in fact does or does not depend-
ing on whether you feel like it. Try on that possibility. “Honor your promise” means something 
like keep them in spite of the circumstances. Try on this possibility: that you present yourself as
f
someone who keeps your word, but in fact are someone who does or does not keep your word 
depending on whether you feel like it. Try that on. I say that if you do that you will have the 
freedom to honor your word. I know more about lying than most people in this room. I’ve lied 
more than most people in this room, and I know the kind of life it gives. And it’s my observation
that you’re never going to be able to honor your word until you can be with yourself in the way 
in which I just accused you of being. I say that until you can be with that, you can’t honor your 
word. By the way, I want to introduce a phrase here: that would be called being authentic about 
being inauthentic. Who doesn’t get this?
MARY 
I know that sometimes I won’t keep my word.
ERHARD
But you don’t present yourself as that.

You say, “Hey Werner, I’m going to meet you tomorrow at noon...”
MARY
And I’ll get there at two.
ERHARD
But you don’t say, “But Werner, I may show up and I may not.”
MARY
No.
ERHARD
That’s the inauthenticity. If you went around saying to people, “Look, I’ll give my word, and
maybe I’ll keep it and maybe I won’t.” Nothing inauthentic about that—that’s quite straight.

And I’m right about that.

We’ll discuss more about that later. You get what I mean about that being inauthentic? Anybody

You’re not confused; you’ve got something going on.

Getting It and Losing It
The Forum content is communicated through the gradual 
development of a series of distinctions. These distinctions off er 
access to a certain way of being; they are ontological clearings, 
contexts of meaning. They shape the way the circumstances of 
life occur so that a new way of being with those circumstances 
arises naturally. The new way of being becomes a possibility when 
the distinction is “gotten”—in Heideggerian terms, in a moment 
of Augenblick, or ontological insight. Thus the purpose of The 
Forum is to have participants “get” the distinctions deeply enough 
during the course of the four days that they leave The Forum 
dwelling in those distinctions. As Erhard told The Forum leaders 
during a debriefing, “What makes a diff erence is that there is a 
conversation generated that distinguishes the distinction, and that 
they’re dwelling in the conversation,” that is, they are “used by” 
the distinction rather than caught up trying to remember a piece of 
information as a precondition to being able to apply it.

What have you got going on?

I’m one of those people who stood up that said I’m a person of my word.
ERHARD
And you’re not. Isn’t that true? You do what you say you’re gonna do?
JAKE
I damn well try.
ERHARD
Very good. “I am a person who will do what I say I am going to do, when in fact, I am only a 
person who will try to do what I said I will do, and what I mean by try is, given the way I see 
things, which will be generated by my feelings, my mood, if I can see that I can’t do it, I won’t
do it. But I’m not gonna tell you that. I’m going to tell you that I’m a person of my word.”
Erhard sat on the edge of the platform facing Jake.
ERHARD (continuing)
Try to sit down.
(Jake sat) 
No, you sat down.
(Jake stood)
I didn’t say sit down. Try to sit down.
(again he sat)
No, you’re sitting. I said try to sit.
JAKE
I’m not getting it.
ERHARD
You’re getting it. You don’t like it. Trying to sit down looks a lot like standing up. You’re just a 
bullshit artist. That’s not a bad thing to be, by the way. It’s just a thing with no power.
JAKE
I’m getting that, but I don’t see the point. What is it worth?
The Heideggerian notion of “dwelling” is central to the way 
in which The Forum material is to be assimilated. Dwelling, for 
Erhard, is synonymous with “coming from”—that is, to dwell 
in a context is to come from that context into one’s life, or to 
allow oneself to be given being by that context. Heidegger 
called dwelling “the basic character of Being in keeping with 
which mortals exist” (“BDT” in PLT 158). Dwelling, for Heidegger, 
designates that ontological state in which we attain our essential 
relatedness to the world, so we must “think for the sake of 
dwelling” (“BDT” in PLT 159).
However, a point that we will introduce here and to which 
we will return throughout this book, is that Being withdraws. The 
ontological communication of The Forum, the speaking of Being, 
occurs always in this precarious context: it wavers on the brink 
of concealment. Thus the process of dwelling-in-a-distinction 
consists of repeatedly “getting” and “losing” that distinction. 
Erhard consistently tells his audiences that if they “got it and it 
went away,” that is the appropriate way to assimilate ontological 
communication: “That’s the way it’s supposed to happen,” he says, 
“getting and losing and getting and losing and getting and losing” 
(“Beyond the Winning Formula”). This is an essential aspect of the 
ontological rhetoric whose nature we are developing here, and it is 
consistent with the authors’ own experience of having participated 
in Werner Erhard’s programs: the insights that we have attained in 
the process have occurred waveringly.
As we have participated over the years in courses and 
seminars based in Erhard’s work, something would oft en be 
said which in that instant produced an illuminating insight, but 
which seemed, a moment or an hour later, to be simply words, 
or even incomprehensible jargon. Longitudinally, however—over 
the years of our participation in this work—we are aware of a 
parallel development: a gradually increasing dwelling-in the way 
of being that has been opened up by the distinctions which we are 
simultaneously getting and losing. Further, this ongoing dwelling-
in has, over the years, become more salient than the getting 
and losing. That is, we notice that we increasingly act from the

ERHARD
Let me tell you something, my friend. You’re not going to get anything out of here you can do 
something with. Do you think I’m going to give an asshole tools? What you walk out of here 
with will give you freedom. You won’t use it. It will use you. I have read all the books, and I’ve 
gotten value; but that’s not transformational.
JAKE
I don’t know where you’re coming from with this asshole stuff . 
ERHARD
It’s not because you are one. I don’t call you an asshole because it’s an apt description. I call you 
that because it has an impact. If I wanted to call you the right name I’d call you Jake.
JAKE
I’m doing a good job as I listen to you, as we talk about keeping your word and things like that. I’m 
aware of the burden I infl ict on myself with trying to keep my word.
ERHARD
And you see, when you walk out of here, you will be free to be your word. There will be no
burden in your word. Not bad. It’s worth something isn’t it? But you haven’t the remotest clue
about how to get there. You couldn’t get there in a billion years. Now we need you to get there,
but you’re stuck in this area. So that’s my business.
(laughter)
If I need someone in your business to do something, I don’t come to me, because I’m an asshole
in your business. You aren’t going to know when this is working and when it’s not working.
You wouldn’t know if we were there if we fell over it, because you look for the wrong kind of 
evidence. Stop worrying about whether it’s working. That’s my job. I don’t mean to attack your 
sincerity. Your sincerity is not worth attacking, because it’s worthless.
JAKE
That almost sounded like an apology.
ERHARD  (looking out at the group)
Your sincerity is worthless because you’re still standing when you try to sit down. Now, I’ve got
to live with your standing, not with your trying. This is like a cult of assholes.
JAKE
It sounds like you’re condoning being a real sloppy person about your word. 
ERHARD
That’s what hooked you, isn’t it? 
way-of-being made available by the distinctions of Erhard’s work; 
that way-of-being is the ontological “place” we come from into the 
encounters of our lives. 
Two significant qualifications must be added here. First, we 
have generalized what has been produced by our participation 
in Erhard’s work as “a way of being.” This is of course a gloss on 
an existential phenomenon that defies capture by words. On the 
one hand we sense, in our recent experiences in the seminars of 
Landmark Worldwide, what we might call reverberations that are 
harmonic with our earliest experiences of Erhard’s work. At the 
same time, since each of us is the way of being whose evolution we 
are addressing, we obviously have no place to stand outside that 
evolution from which to address it.
Second, these years have included years when we have 
participated regularly and frequently in Erhard’s work, and years 
when we have not participated at all. Our assessment of this 
process is that our experience of life has been enhanced during 
those periods of participation. Certainly there have been ups 
and downs in every period; but the phenomenon that Erhard 
calls transformation does indeed live in language, and it is our 
experience that regular participation in the conversation keeps 
it alive. And for us, even in the nonparticipating periods, the 
development of the distinctions remains ongoing just in the 
process of life itself.
 Thus the purpose of The Forum is to communicate the 
distinctions repeatedly and at suff icient length such that 
participants can move, as far as possible, from getting them to 
dwelling in them. “Why we’re going on and on down there,” Erhard 
told The Forum leaders during a debriefing session, “is so that 
the distinctions are transferred from something people get to 
something they come from.”
Therefore, we request that readers consider this possibility in 
approaching the ideas in this book. If something we say seems, at 
one moment, to make sense, but upon further reflection doesn’t, 
that may be the way it should be assimilated.
For the senior author, the point which Erhard was making 
at this particular juncture of The Forum—that I present myself as

Yep.
ERHARD
It sounded like I was attacking one of your sacred beliefs. You couldn’t tolerate being a guy who
said he would do it and didn’t do it. You couldn’t listen to the rest of what I said, and got con-
fused. You can’t live with being a guy who doesn’t keep his word.
JAKE 
I think I have good reasons for not doing it.
ERHARD
I didn’t say it wasn’t a valid story. I love everybody’s story. But you can’t ask about it, “true” or 
“false”? Is it really true that you couldn’t do it? What’s true is that you
t
didn’t do it. Sometimes a
t
cigar is just a cigar, as Freud said. Listen, you can’t be with that. You can’t be with the possibility 
of not being your word. And you know what? Something happened, when you were a kid, and 
you couldn’t be that anymore.
JAKE
This is something I value.
ERHARD
I know. You’re nutty about it.
JAKE
Yes I am a nut about it.
ERHARD
And anything you’re nutty about you have no freedom with.
JAKE
What’s the value in being two hours late just because you want to be two hours late?

I never said anything like that. You said that. You’re so nutty you’re hearing voices. That’s part 
metaphorical and part literal.
JAKE
No, somebody did say that.
MARY
I said that, but I didn’t say I wouldn’t try.
someone who keeps my word, whereas in reality I keep my word 
when I cannot justify not keeping it—wavers for me as I consider 
it. I see its validity: I do keep my promises and adhere to my 
agreements, but only until I see some overriding justification for 
breaking them. I obey most laws—my social contracts—except 
for certain laws which I justify not keeping: for example, I cannot 
personally justify cheating on my income tax returns, but I oft en 
justify exceeding the speed limit. The classic ethical dilemma—
whether one would tell an axe murderer the “truth” about the 
location of his innocent quarry—can be seen as a variation of this 
same point: I tell the truth until I can justify not telling it.
And yet I notice my resistance to accepting this when it is 
put so baldly. Protestations of my “honesty” leap to mind: it is 
not that I keep my word depending on how I feel about it, it is 
that I always keep my word except when there is some overriding 
reason not to. But—and here is the point Erhard is driving 
toward—isn’t that simply the same “what happened” with a 
diff erent “story” attached to it? Isn’t it true that I either keep my 
word or I don’t, and then I add a story, a justification of some 
nature for whichever action I take? Doesn’t the “what happened” 
remain unaltered, regardless of the explanation or justification I 
attach to the event?  ■

In some languages making promises sometimes involves using a special tense that says you

When I arrive, if I do...
PAUL
It’s characteristic of other languages. In Spanish there’s all these subjunctive tenses. You can
say: “When you do this for me, then I’ll do that.” It’s subjunctive, it’s something we don’t recog-
nize in our language. It’s recognized as theoretical. Maybe that’s what you’re getting at.
ERHARD
No it’s not, but what you’ve said is useful nevertheless for what I am getting at: that you will 
present yourself as a person who will do what you said you will do, and you don’t do what you 
say you will do. In fact maybe you will do it and maybe you won’t. That’s inauthentic.

I have a lot of respect for people who speak several languages. I don’t mean any disrespect, but
it doesn’t mean you know shit about language. 
PAUL
Well, language encompasses a pattern of thought, a process of thought. It’s contained within
the language you think within. Like I was referring to with Spanish, you have within the lan-

things are real...

JAKE
It doesn’t make it authentic, but it doesn’t make me dishonest. It doesn’t make me a liar either.
ERHARD  (to the group) 
I’m taking all this time with this bullshit because I want to accomplish something. No mat-
ter what I bring up, somebody will have a thing about it. Somebody will be nutty about it. No 
matter what they’re saying, it’s obvious these two guys are intelligent. But they’ve got their foot
nailed to the fl oor, so it’s like talking to stupid people. Being stuck makes you stupid. There’s no 
power available where you’ve got your foot nailed to the fl oor. All this conversation regarding
intention, in response to my simple statement about authenticity, indicates that there’s some 
nuttiness there. The point is, at some point, you will be that person.
(to Jake)
And to settle this conversation: I ask you to stand in—that a person who presents himself one 
way, and in fact acts another way, for any reason, is inauthentic. That’s not true. It’s a “take the
case that” I’m asking you to stand in. Is that clear?

There’s no power available where you’ve got
your foot nailed to the floor.

Jake nodded and then sat down.
ERHARD (to Paul)
Did you get what I said to him?
PAUL
Yeah, so, what you’re saying is that specifi c instance you didn’t do what you said, you’re inau-
thentic, and I would agree with you there, but...
ERHARD
I don’t want your agreement. I want you to create this square.
 
(drawing an imaginary square on the fl oor in front of Paul) 
Inside that square is a diff erent world. Inside that world, when you act one way and present
yourself another way, that’s inauthentic.
PAUL
Specifi cally, or generally?
ERHARD
Generally. Just in that world. It’s not true in the rest of the world. Can you handle that?
PAUL
Yeah. I’m not sure what it applies to, but...
ERHARD
It doesn’t apply to anything. Can you handle that?
PAUL
Yeah.
ERHARD
Stand in that square and listen to what I say next. Because only standing there will what I’m
about to say make any sense. All right? You ready to stand in that square?
(to Paul)
You ready? So in that little square, I know it’s not true, and it’s not that way in the rest of the
world, and for those for whom one and one is two, when you pretend to be one way and act
another, that’s called inauthentic. When you own up to this, that’s being authentic about your 
inauthenticity. Anybody not get that? That’s the beginning of authenticity. Authenticity does not 
AUTHENTICITY
Here Erhard provides a counterintuitive, but very Heideggerian 
premise: authenticity is possible only with the development 
of an authentic relationship with our own inauthenticity. Here 
authenticity is an act of ownership, of owning the calculative 
clearing which we are, of accepting the particular gift  of Being 
whose sending characterizes our epoch. Heidegger introduced 
this idea in Being and Time, where he employed the term 
“resoluteness” to characterize Dasein’s state of having-
appropriated; he described this resoluteness as an empowering 
authenticity toward one’s own inauthenticity: 
Resoluteness appropriates untruth authen-
tically. Dasein is already in irresoluteness, 
and soon, perhaps, will be in it again. . . . The 
irresoluteness of the “they” remains domi-
nant, notwithstanding, but it cannot impugn 
resolute existence. (BT 345)
“
This idea lies at the heart of the appropriative event: in 
the context of having appropriated one’s inauthenticity, that 
inauthenticity, which persists, is nevertheless transformed. 
It is an idea which defies our usual thinking: ontically, such a 
“transformation” can only be seen as blatant self-justification, a 
philosophically sophisticated rationalization for accepting one’s 
worst nature. Ontologically, however, appropriation justifies 
nothing. Appropriation appropriates; it gives Being. Resoluteness, 
then, is “the opening up of human being, out of its captivity in 
that which is, to the openness of Being” (“OWA” in PLT 67). Much 
of The Forum is devoted to developing the possibility of a non-
justificatory event of appropriation. ■

begin with being authentic. Authenticity begins with being authentic about your inauthenticity. 
If you’re ever going to have any degree of authenticity the only way to get there is to start with
being authentic about your inauthenticity.
(to the group)
I’m not interested in your belief systems, I’m not interested in your values, I’m not interested in
your principles. So no more conversations like I just had with Jake and Paul. I don’t mean don’t
say anything, I mean don’t preach. I’ll do all the preaching in here, and if I’m any good, I won’t
do any either. All I’m asking when I talk to you about the things I’m talking about is: build
a square, stand inside of it, look out at life and the world and see what you can see standing
in that square and standing in that possibility. If it empowers you to stand there, keep it. If it
doesn’t empower you to stand there, destroy it. Simple.
BELLA
You said to someone else that something happened when they were a child. I remembered. My 
father was a liar, and I decided I could never be that. I had to be honest. I’ve had no freedom to 
keep my word.
ERHARD
You can’t be anything you’re forced to be. Anything you are forced to be, you aren’t.
BELLA
I couldn’t stand the feeling.
ERHARD
Yeah.
(to the group)
Who couldn’t stand being a liar?
(several raise their hands)
You think a truth teller would fi nd lying absolutely abhorrent? For the person who tells the
truth you don’t have any problem with a lie, it’s only somebody down in the swamp, in the bot-
tom of the Valley of the Shadow of Death, who is afraid they might be a liar. I know you know 
better.
BELLA
I am a liar.
ERHARD
Yeah. You are a liar. That’s being authentic about being inauthentic. And that’s the beginning of 
authenticity—and the beginning of the freedom to tell the truth.
“ 
All I’m asking when I talk to you about the 
things I’m talking about is: build a square,
stand inside of it, look out at life and the 
world and see what you can see standing in
that square and standing in that possibility.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (to the group)
I know most of you don’t get that, but never mind. Just listen. What today and tomorrow is
about mostly is about being authentic about being inauthentic. So there are a couple of things
to get. One: you present yourself as someone who keeps your word, but in fact you are someone
who does or does not keep your word depending on whether you feel like it. Is that the truth
about you? I told you I don’t know the truth. See if it’s empowering—like trying on a robe. 
Two: when you can wear that robe, that’s called being authentic about your own inauthenticity.
Always, the beginning of authenticity is being authentic about your own inauthenticity. I want 
you to treat the promises in here diff erently from usual. I want you to say “regardless.” When it’s 
all over, maybe you will, maybe you won’t. Sincerity is pure story. I’m asking you to engage in 
these promises as a matter of integrity, not sincerity. As a matter of fact, standing in the back-
ground is always the possibility that you may not. But then you won’t, and that’s that.
At 3:12 pm, The Forum adjourned for a second break.

SPEAKING BEING
Dasein: Meaning and Mineness
Dasein is Martin Heidegger’s name for the central figure in his 1927 magnum opus, 
Being and Time. The term is one of the few in Heidegger’s writing that consistently 
remains untranslated from the German: the most literal translation of Da-Sein is be-
ing-there. Scholar Hubert Dreyfus suggests that the best way to understand Dasein 
is to think of “our term ‘human being,’ which can refer to a way of being that is char-
acteristic of all people or to a specific person—a human being” (Hubert L. Dreyfus, 
Being-in-the-World 14). 
But the term being-there itself indicates the essential characteristic that distin-
guishes humans from other beings. Dasein is being-there because it is the only being 
for whom its Being is an issue. Humans are the beings who reflect upon themselves, 
and the only ones who exist in a world of meaning. We dwell in a meaningful “there,” 
and we bring our “there” along with us when we show up. Other beings inhabit the 
earth; human beings live in a world. 
This is a challenging and essential aspect of the thinking Heidegger is devel-
oping here, and a distinction that emerges persistently over the four days of The 
Forum. The meanings of the things in our world are not properties of the things 
themselves. Non-human beings are “entities whose kind of Being is of a charac-
ter other than Dasein’s,” and therefore they must be understood as “unmeaning, 
essentially devoid of any meaning at all” (BT 193). When Heidegger says that “only 
Dasein can be meaningful or meaningless,” he is saying that other beings can have or 
lack meaning only when they are encountered by Dasein and are thereby disclosed as 
meaningful or not (BT 192–193). Consider: a dog may not be “a dog” for another dog, 
nor may the dog see “beauty” in a sunset. Dasein is the only being in whose world 
there is meaning. Only for human beings do things show up as the things they are.
Further, Dasein is the only being for whom existence is always an issue, and the 
issue for each Dasein is always fundamentally its own existence. Heidegger calls this 
human characteristic mineness: the Being of human beings, while it characterizes 
the ontological nature of the collective, always occurs as the Being of a particular 
human being. Therefore, while Dasein is not a person, we have to talk about it as if 
it were: “Because Dasein has in each case mineness, one must always use a personal 
pronoun when one addresses it: ‘I am,’ ‘you are’” (BT 68). 
Each Dasein relates to this existential situation in a particular way. “Mineness 
belongs to any existent Dasein, and belongs to it as the condition which makes 
authenticity and inauthenticity possible” (BT 78, emphasis added). That is, my 
SESSION TWO INTERVAL
Dasein is always mine, but whether or not that relationship is authentic—as Werner 
Erhard would put it, whether I own the condition of mineness, or whether it owns 
me—depends upon an act of existential choice. The purpose of The Forum is to 
bring participants face-to-face with that choice, thereby making available the possi-
bility of authentic existence.

SPEAKING BEING
The Forum resumed at 4:00 pm. Erhard was not present for this session. During 
the first half-hour, The Forum Supervisor, Julie, oversaw a procedure that took 
place in every Forum (but is currently not practiced in The Landmark Forum): 
participants raised their hands, section by section, to request rides or places to stay 
during the four days of The Forum, and other participants responded with offers. 
This process having been completed, Kipp came onto the platform. He introduced 
himself and Wes as the two Forum leaders who would be leading The Forum with 
Erhard, and then turned to the next order of business: the promises and requests 
of The Forum, which Erhard had mentioned earlier in the day. Julie, the Course 
Supervisor, came forward. 
JULIE
We’re asking you to give your word—to make certain promises—and to keep 
your word—to keep the promises.
The required promises:
(1) Regarding speaking in The Forum: Raise your hand, speak into the micro-
phone. Don’t talk to each other during The Forum.
(2) Wear your name tag at all times. Get the name on the tag correct.
(3) Take no notes. No tape recorders or cameras, no busy work at your chair, 
no food/drink in the room. Exception: Forum leaders may take notes.
(4) You agree to maintain the confidentiality of The Forum. This includes 
names of participants and their remarks. Keep in mind that confidentiality in 
a group of this size cannot be guaranteed.
(5) Regarding videotaping: if you didn’t earlier sign a video release, sit in the 
no-video section.
(6) No resale agreement. All materials in this program are the property of 
Werner Erhard and Associates, in some instances protected by copyright. 
You agree not to resell, modify, package, and deliver in a seminar, training 
program, workshop, consulting, or similar business activity. This protection 
extends beyond the copyright law.
(7) Informed consent. The Forum is not therapeutic in design or intent. Forum 
leaders are not trained mental health professionals. A series of questions was 
included about participant’s status with regard to therapy. If you’re in therapy 
and winning, advise your therapist. If not, or if you’ve been hospitalized for 
drug or alcohol abuse, we recommend you don’t take The Forum. In the form 
you signed earlier there is a list of emotions which may come up during The 
Forum; if you find them threatening, don’t take the Forum. If you have a prob-
lem dealing with stress, don’t take The Forum. Certain medical conditions and 
certain drugs are also listed in this category. This informed consent is intended 
to have legal significance.
FORUM DAY ONE: SESSION THREE
KIPP
Are there any questions regarding the ground rules?
PARTICIPANT
What are the reasons for the rules?
KIPP
Everything that we design is not meant to suppress you. It’s meant to provide 
maximum possible benefit for you from The Forum. 
PARTICIPANT
I’d like to know why we’re spending so much time on logistics. I’m angry.
(applause from some of the group)
KIPP
So you have no question? Thanks.
Following the required rules, an opportunity to leave was announced. No one did. 
KIPP
Your sitting in your chair is a promise, and we will relate to you on the basis 
that you have given your word. 
JULIE  (continuing to read the recommended promises)
(1) Be present for all sessions. We recommend that you be on time in the 
morning and back from breaks. If you miss any part of any Forum session, you 
forfeit the right to expect the results of The Forum.
(2) Do not consume drugs and medications—including alcohol, aspirin, mar-
ijuana, but not including those prescribed by your doctor—before the end of 
the fourth day of The Forum.
(3) Stay awake during The Forum. Staying awake is easier if you don’t slouch 
or slump in your chair. If you get sleepy, we recommend that you sit straight 
in the chair with your eyes open.
KIPP
A distinction has started to open up in the room: I’ll try vs. I’ll keep my promis-
es. This distinction was not merely about words. We’re not asking you to speak 
a certain way. We’re showing you a distinction of an empowering way to be 
with promises.

way, a way you’re going to have to invent rather than discover. Namely, what 
you’re willing to put at stake. You can’t ever find something at stake. You can 
only invent it, create it. It’s a creative act, it’s a self-generated challenge which 
you create for yourself. And that’s who you are for The Forum. Some of the 
tools you need for this we haven’t developed in here yet. The first place you 
will look is at what’s wrong with you. Let that be. This is confusing because 
it requires real thinking. Your reasons got you here but they are no longer 
sufficient. During the meal break, I invite you to create what you’re willing to 
put at stake.
(pausing)
This works. We’re not wondering anymore whether The Forum works. We’re 
promising you that you can have anything you are willing to stand for having 
gotten in The Forum. And the access to that is your willingness to put yourself 
at stake here in The Forum. This requires speaking. You speak yourself in the 
matter. The first action which it requires is speaking, speaking what you’re 
putting at stake. And the second part is to promise to be your word. Have a 
conversation with others at dinner about this: if your life were an expression, 
what would that expression be? The Forum won’t provide you with what’s 
possible out of a reason for being here. At-stakeness is something that exists 
the moment you create it as a possibility. What we’re asking you to do is to 
begin to create your life. What you’re willing to stand for in here is what you 
have at stake. 
PARTICIPANT
What’s the difference between The Forum and positive thinking? 
KIPP 
Remember that “stop thinking” exercise we mentioned earlier? Try to make 
all those thoughts positive. It’s a difficult thing to do, trying to make some-
thing you have nothing to do with positive. Like, “Oh my God! There’s a bad 
thought! It’s supposed to be positive!”
(to the group)
During the meal break, you are to create what you are willing to put at stake 
like a possibility. Have a conversation with another person and with who you 
are going to have dinner with.
Following this discussion, Julie came onto the platform and announced a meal 
break at 6:20 pm.
JULIE  (continuing to read the suggested promises)
(1) Eat only during the one announced meal break. Eat a big breakfast.
(2) Don’t sit next to someone you knew before The Forum started.
(3) Advise us of the phone number where you’re staying this week. 
Assistants distributed phone information cards.
PARTICIPANT
Is gum chewing forbidden in The Forum? 
KIPP 
How many drops of pee does it take to spoil the stew? 
PARTICIPANT 
One.
KIPP 
Get it? 
PARTICIPANT
I know I should say yes. I know the group is the stew. Am I the pee?
KIPP
You’re at a moment of choice now.
(to the group)
What are some reasons for being in The Forum? 
PARTICIPANTS (several calling out)
So my speaking is a possibility for people; Because I know there’s more out 
there; etc. 
KIPP 
Now let’s hear some things you could fix from being in The Forum. 
Again, people called out answers, a series of standard benefi ts similar in quality to 
the fi rst group of responses. 
KIPP 
Neither of these provide you with what work The Forum has for you. A reason 
for being here, or something to fix, won’t provide you with what you need 
to be in The Forum. So we’re going to have to think of being here in a new

Yankelovich Study Results  
Prior to the delivery of The Forum presented in this book, Werner Erhard and Asso-
ciates (WE&A) commissioned a study by noted social scientist Daniel Yankelovich, 
SESSION THREE INTERVAL
wherein he analyzed the results reported by graduates of the course. By the time 
the results of the study were published, circa 1991, Erhard had sold WE&A to his em-
ployees, and that company today is called Landmark. Here is the summary of those 
results and Yankelovich’s analysis.
An Analysis of The Forum and Its Benefi ts 
A Yankelovich (DYG, Inc.) Study
Summary
Internationally recognized social scientist Daniel Yankelovich surveyed more than 1300 people who completed The
Forum during a three-month period. Prior to their course, people were asked what they expected to achieve in the 
course; after their course, they were asked about the benefits they actually received.
The study explored four areas: the value of The Forum, the profile of participants, satisfaction levels after The Forum, 
and unexpected benefits that were experienced. A few of the findings include:
 
•  More than 90% of participants report practical and enduring value for their life — well worth the time and 
cost.
 
•  More than 90% of participants report a better understanding of relationships and their role in them.
 
•  Nearly every participant received unexpected benefits — ranging from achieving personal and 
professional goals.
“Several of the study’s findings surprised me quite a bit, especially the large number of participants for whom The
Forum proved to be ‘one of the most valued experiences of my life.’ This is not a sentiment that people, particularly
successful, well-educated people, express lightly. I can understand why people recommend The Forum to their 
associates, friends, and relatives.”
Daniel Yankelovich, Chairman 
DYG, Inc. (public opinion analyst)
Daniel Yankelovich, Chairman of DYG, Inc., a noted social scientist and public opinion analyst, as well as a leading
researcher of values and future trends who has been conducting these kinds of studies for more than 30 years,
did an analysis of the survey.
The following charts indicate the value reported from The Forum, the benefits most often cited as a result of their
participation, and their level of satisfaction.
Daniel Yankelovich is a
leading interpreter of trends 
shaping American society
and the global economy. He 
is the author of 10 books
and chairman/founder of
three organizations: Public Agenda; DYG, Inc.; and 
Viewpoint Learning. His pioneering work has earned
him numerous awards in the field of public opinion
research.
“ More than 7 out of 10 found the 
course to be one of their life’s 
most rewarding experiences. 
To me, this suggests that it 
addresses many of people’s 
most profound concerns — 
to improve their personal 
relationships, how to be a more 
effective person, how to think 
productively about their lives 
and goals.”

Value of  The Forum
The degree of value to which participants
felt the course had in the areas listed below:
Satisfaction Levels
The degree to which The Forum fully
met the expectations of those attending 
for these reasons:
Unexpected Benefi ts
Nearly every participant in the Yankelovich survey reported
receiving some entirely unexpected benefits from The
Forum. These benefits ranged from specific educational to
business goals. Unexpected benefits were most frequently
noted in nine areas:
1. Greater confidence and self-esteem
2.  A new ability to express thoughts and feelings,
both publicly and privately
3. Job is more enjoyable and satisfying
4. Better relationships with co-workers
5. More comfortable and at ease with others
6.  Less concerned with the approval and opinion of others
7. Better relationship with parents and family members
8. Overcame a fear or anxiety
9. Have more fun in life
Profi le of Participants
These charts indicate the distribution of participants by age, educational level, and occupation. The greatest number of
participants are in their mid-twenties to mid-forties. On the whole, they are very well educated, with 87% indicating some
college work, well over half having completed college, and 20% holding postgraduate degrees. Participation is distributed
fairly evenly between women and men, and among married, single, and previously married adults.

Areas of Greatest Impact
Before attending the workshop, we asked participants to indicate areas where they felt they needed improvement. Very
few people felt they needed a great deal of improvement in many of the 68 areas we questioned. Yet after the workshop,
many participants realized that they could improve themselves and their job performance dramatically in ways they hadn’t 
considered before the workshop. The ranking below shows the areas where the workshop had the greatest impact.
Being able to acknowledge mistakes fully and do what is necessary
to correct them.
Being fully committed to my company’s success.
Having high standards of quality for myself and the people who 
work with me and for me.
Confronting difficult situations head-on instead of avoiding them.
Always listening carefully and attentively to other people at work.
Being as concerned with the performance of my department/division
and the company overall as I am with my own performance.
Always being responsive to the concerns of those who work for me.
Being quick to give recognition to others for the work they do.
Welcoming constructive criticism from others.
Being very effective in communicating work related issues with 
my co-workers.
Being good at letting other people get all the credit they deserve.
Feeling free to be frank and open with those who report to me.

7:50 pm: Erhard’s manner was light and casual as he opened this session, interrupted by a number 
of people who were returning late from the meal break. The first participant to stand shared that in 
looking for issues to put at stake, he found that his issues were already big enough and did not feel 
he needed to invent new ones. Erhard noticed an empty seat and began to manage people missing.

I made up my mind not to call you assholes any more, but I want you to know it’s very hard. 
Speaking about issues and what you can have at stake...
(drawing a large circle on the chalkboard) 
Let that circle represent everything there is to know. Everyone in The Forum is successful. We 
know from independent studies of The Forum that participants are above average in their abil-
ity to succeed. So a certain amount of what is in this circle you know, and you know that you 
know. 
(drawing a small wedge in the circle) 
What we do to be successful and able is we put what we know to use. That’s what common 
sense tells us to do with what we know that we know. But there is also some stuff that we don’t 
know, and know that we don’t know.
(adding a larger wedge) 
The older I’ve gotten, the more I know I don’t know. Common sense tells us that to find out 
what we know that we don’t know, we need to go to school, read a book, take a seminar. I’d 
like you to see that you really fit that. The rest of the pie is what you don’t know that you don’t 
know. What does common sense tell you to do about that? Nothing. Common sense is silent on 
that subject. What The Forum is about is what you don’t know that you don’t know—what’s 
behind you that you can’t see. The purpose of The Forum is to provide access to what you didn’t 
know that you didn’t know. In independent surveys, people have reported that The Forum is the 
single most dramatic learning experience in their life.
(drawing a point on the second chalkboard)
When you take a point, which has zero dimensions, and extend it into the first dimension, you 
get a line.
(drawing a line extending from the point)
You don’t get a bigger and better point. Then, when you extend the line into the second dimen-
sion, you don’t get a bigger and better line: you get a plane.
(drawing out from the line to form a square)
And when you extend a two-dimensional plane into the third dimension, you don’t get a bigger 
and better plane, you get a three dimensional figure, in this case, a cube.
(building from the square, Erhard drew a cube)
Almost invariably, the results of our life are results from extending ourselves on the same 
dimension. But adding a new dimension is an exponential leap. You want to listen up here and 
get this! The Forum doesn’t push out on the dimensions of living already available to you. What

it does is add a dimension. So there’s an exponential leap in the possibility of Being. And that’s 
maybe why there are these outrageous claims people make about what they got from participat-
ing in The Forum.
PARTICIPANT
Couldn’t you add a fourth slice to the pie? Intuition? What you know but don’t know that you 
know.
ERHARD
Yes, that’s very legitimate. You didn’t get the point about dimensionality?
(adding it to the model on the board)
In a point, you have no degrees of freedom. In a line, one dimension, you get one degree of free-
dom, and so on, and we simply expand on that one degree of freedom. The Forum adds a new 
dimension. You get an exponential leap of possibility. 
PARTICIPANT
It’s what you don’t know that you don’t know.
ERHARD
Exactly. 
PARTICIPANT
How do you get there?
ERHARD
You’re in here four days and one evening. You’ll see how it’s done by the end of the third day. 
Anybody else here not get this dimensionality? 
PARTICIPANT
Could you say that what The Forum does is to “unconceal” a new dimension?
ERHARD
Yes, that’s a technical term for it. It’s called unconcealing. What begins to get you into this 
domain of “don’t know that you don’t know” is to dwell in the power of the question. We’re 
hungry for answers, addicted to answers. People hate being in the question; they want the 
answer. You don’t get answers. Light gets shed on what you are concerned with. That’s not the 
way you and I are usually. The way you and I are is hungry for answers. What do I do about it? 
The beginning of gaining access to what you don’t know that you don’t know, the beginning of 
establishing a new dimension for being, a new dimension for living, is to start to dwell in the 
question, develop the courage and the stamina and the wherewithal to orient yourself around 
“ 
Can you formulate a question, the asking 
of which is empowering? So that you’d be 
willing to stay in the question?

questions the asking of which makes a difference. There are certain questions, just the asking of 
which impacts people’s ability in life. See, you and I don’t look for those questions, we look for 
answers, which you can only find in what you know that you don’t know. This is about devel-
oping questions the asking of which gives access to what you don’t know that you don’t know 
about your life, about other people, and about living. The Forum is about developing a certain 
muscle for asking questions the mere asking of which makes a difference.
Here Erhard read a passage from Heidegger’s On the Way to Language (page 13), in which Heidegger
recounts his dialogue with a Japanese scholar:
ERHARD (reading)
“Japanese: We Japanese do not think it strange if a dialogue leaves undefined what is really 
intended...”
(to the group)
That’s not very familiar to most of us, is it? In our dialogues we want to get definition very 
quickly. We want it explained.
(continuing to read)
“...or even restores it back to the keeping of the undefinable. 
Inquirer: That is part, I believe, of every dialogue that has turned out well between thinking be-
ings. As if of its own accord, it can take care that that undefinable something not only does not 
slip away, but displays its gathering force ever more luminously in the course of the dialogue.”
(to the group)
That means putting it back into “don’t know that you don’t know.” It’s a harmonic with what 
I read you earlier about the unspoken. See, what you’re looking for here is light, not answers. 
Insight you can’t create by the numbers. What you want if you’re going to create is light, not 
answers. Listen up, goddammit!
(continuing to read)
“Our dialogues with Count Kuki probably failed to turn out so well. We younger men chal-
lenged him much too directly to satisfy our thirst for handy information.”
(to the group)
You’re here listening for answers. You’re listening for what we call “tips.” Nothing worthwhile in life 
can be gotten there by ten steps. Or twenty steps. You can’t dance knowing where to put your feet.
(continuing to read)
“Inquirer: Thirst for knowledge and greed for explanations never lead to a thinking inquiry. 
Curiosity is always the concealed arrogance of a self-consciousness that banks on a self-invent-
ed ratio and its rationality.”
(to the group)
What that all means is that this greed, this thirst, the question, “How am I going to use this?”—
that’s a product, according to this guy, of a concealed arrogance, an arrogance that everything

in life that’s worth knowing is merely an extension of what I already know. But the truth is that 
everything worth knowing is going to violate what you know.
(continuing to read)
“The will to know does not will to abide in hope before what is worthy of thought.”
(to the group)
I think all there is, is having thoughts. But there are certain things that if you stand in front of 
them in a certain way, give you thinking. If you stand in front of things worthy of thought you 
get thinking. Thinking is a dance with that about which you are thinking. When you stand in 
front of questions worthy of thought, you get thinking. Now that’s tough, because we’re in the 
rainstorm called “I think.” We’re all Cartesians. No one’s had an original thought since then 
about thinking—at least not one that has gotten to you or me. You and I are still Cartesians. But 
there are possibilities beyond Descartes. And they give you access to a new way of being that 
you can’t get to—being the kind of person you already always are. We’re going to be thinking. 
That’s the way The Forum works. It goes backwards.
PARTICIPANT
What about disciplines that promise “inner transcendence”?
ERHARD
Inner transcendence. That’s what California is about. I don’t want to insult your pet project, 
but I am not a guy in a diner about getting someplace. And you aren’t going to get there leaping 
over being human. There’s no possibility of being beyond what you already always are until you 
own what you already always are. Californians don’t like that. Californians have this magical 
bullshit they believe in. That’s not the way The Forum works. The Forum’s got two pieces to it. 
The first is an inquiry into the already always being of human being. What kind of an opening 
are you for life? What’s the color of the clearing you are for life? To say that more rigorously: 
what is the already always condition of being for human beings? What did you get yourself 
into here? Not your individual version of being human. That’s the question of ninety percent of 
The Forum. That’s called going backwards. It’s about owning yourself as you already are. Being 
authentic about inauthenticity is particularly frightening for Californians. We don’t want to be 
inauthentic. Why? Because it looks bad. And I don’t like looking bad. And your life is about 
looking good. This is moving backwards to own what I already always am. This is not individ-
ualistic except that each of us has his or her own version, we got wet in this rainstorm called 
human being. What is it to be a human being? See, people don’t ask that question. They want to 
be thinner, younger, sexier. Those questions don’t give thinking. Because it is a question worthy 
of thought it creates the possibility of thinking.
The Forum is two questions. The first: what is the already always being of human beings? Being 
human owns you. It gives you your life. The second half of The Forum is another question. The 
second question is, what is the possibility of being for human beings? What’s possible beyond 
what I was given to be? I did what’s called in Zen the low road. In the low road you must do 
everything that doesn’t work. So I’m not a guy in a diner about the low road. Most people want 
“ 
There’s no possibility of being beyond what 
you already always are until you own what 
you already always are.

to start with the second question. But you can’t get to the possibility until you own what you 
already always are. The pathway—concrete, authentic, real—is to embrace what you already 
always are.
(pausing)
The problem is that if you move forward from where you are, all you’re doing is changing. The 
medium in which you create may be something, but the source of creation is nothing. I had the 
privilege of having a relationship with Dick Feynman, the physicist. He took one note the whole 
time I knew him: “There are certain things you can only know by creating them.” As a matter 
of fact, when he died that note was on his blackboard. That was just my best moment.
(pausing)
When I use the term possibility, I mean stuff in the dimension of “don’t know that you don’t 
know.” So that’s what The Forum is about. In the first question, you move backwards. And it 
begins with being authentic about your own inauthenticity. To the degree that you’re not able 
to be with your own inauthenticity, to that degree you are unable to be. Where’s Jake? I want 
to identify the conversation we were having. He’s a fine guy. And yet, I’m saying that there’s 
something possible in that area he has a lot of interest that is denied to him because he can’t be 
“I don’t do what I said I would do.” I didn’t say that was true about him. That’s not important. 
What’s important is that he can’t be there yet. Whatever you’re not able to be with won’t let you 
be. So the degree to which you are not able to be with your inauthenticity, to that degree you 
are prevented from being. You’re stuck being this, so there’s nothing else you can be. Or you’re 
stuck not being that, so there’s nothing else you can be except not that. You’re like a Johnny 
one-note “not-that.” Not-that is way more attached than have-to-be-that.
I get this as a dance. I’m uncomfortable. I don’t know where to put my feet. It’s extremely un-
comfortable to be in that “don’t know that you don’t know.”
ERHARD
So “don’t know that you don’t know” is uncomfortable. Ever jumped out of an airplane? It’s 
uncomfortable. It’s also a lot of fun. 
PARTICIPANT
I’m starting to ask myself, “what is worthwhile?”
ERHARD
That’s a great question: A question to live with. If you live with that question for the rest of your 
life, your life will have a quality that it won’t have without it. You ask the question for the light 
the question gives.
“ 
To the degree that you’re not able to be with 
your own inauthenticity, to that degree you
are unable to be.

PARTICIPANT
That’s just life.
ERHARD
It’s life in the fast lane. “The more things change the more they remain the same.” That’s true. 
And we’ll look at why that’s so.
PARTICIPANT
There’s fun in engaging with this even though I don’t know what I’m doing. 
ERHARD
I don’t know what I’m doing. Would you want to dance knowing what you’re doing? But in 
our culture, you’re not allowed not to know. It’s shameful not to know. It’s the way we already 
always are. There’s an opportunity to develop a certain relationship with not knowing in here 
that will give you a more powerful access to what is worth knowing. With me? Thanks.
(pausing)
I’m not going to call on anybody for a while. We’re going to introduce a new what-you-call 
subject. We’re going to introduce a new what-I-call distinction. When this is all over, you’ll call 
it that too. The distinction is concern. The usual meaning of concern is “worried about.” When I 
use the word concern I use it in a broader sense. You and I are constituted by a body of con-
cerns, kind of like what we attend to. 
Erhard drew an X on the chalkboard.
ERHARD  (continuing)
X is a symbol that represents one of your concerns. X could be “being related.”
(responding to a participant asking for clarifi cation)
It could be said that human beings are constituted by a body of concerns. The word constitutive 
means something more than “is a part of.” It means something like “gives the thing itself.” It’s 
like your concerns give you your self. 
PARTICIPANT
It gives the essence of my self...
ERHARD
You’ve got to watch because I’m going to say “no” to damn near everything you’re going to say, 
and everything you say is good, but it’s not quite it. We’re not going to get this nailed down and 
I’ll show you why in just a second. You’re in the right ballpark. You’re fine.
(pausing)
So X represents one of your concerns. Let’s just say this represents the concern for being related. 
Everybody’s got this concern. A hermit expresses this concern by saying “I’m not related.” 
CONCERN
In introducing the distinction concern, Erhard is articulating 
another hint at the realm of Being the Forum is designed to evoke. 
As with his earlier conversation about moods, he is relocating the 
source of participants’ problems from their own agency to the 
contextualizing background. 
In Being and Time, Heidegger makes a similar move when 
he says that “Being-in-the-world has always dispersed itself or 
even split itself up into definite ways of Being-in.” To develop 
this point, he provides a list of examples, such as having to do 
with something, producing something, attending to something, 
undertaking, and considering. “All these ways of Being-in,” he says 
“have concern as their kind of Being” (BT 83).
Heidegger also distinguishes a category that he calls deficient 
modes of concern, in which “the possibilities of concern are kept 
to a ‘bare minimum’” (BT 83). Deficient modes include leaving 
undone, neglecting, renouncing, and taking a rest.
In everyday use, the word “concern” can have several 
meanings. The most common in our current usage is 
apprehension, as in “I am concerned for the success of our 
project.” But Heidegger and Erhard have used the term in another 
way, as a term for an existential characteristic of human beings, “a 
possible way of Being-in-the-world.” 
Just as human beings are never not in-the-world, they are 
likewise never not concerned, since they are concern essentially. 
Consider: you cannot locate yourself outside of your concerns, 
since the very attempt to do so is itself a manifestation of concern. 
Like lightning, which exists only in flashing, a human being exists 
always and only as a body of concerns.
With this distinction, both Heidegger and Erhard are 
undermining our everyday understanding of the meanings in 
our world. In so doing, they are preparing the way for the final 
transformational leap, the evocation of the Nothing. ■

SPEAKING BEING
You’ve got a concern for being related otherwise why would you be concerned about not being 
related? Clear? 
(pausing)
What is our access to what concerns us? Our access to what concerns us is to get at what con-
cerns us in its aftermath. After the thing happens, in hindsight, we can understand. You can’t 
even see it before it happens, can you? The already always access that human beings have to 
their concerns, the access you inherited, is something like this...
To the right of the X Erhard listed description, defi nition, and explanation.
ERHARD (continuing)
...All of which, will lead to understanding.
(adding “understanding” to the list)
And out of understanding you derive prescriptions, which gives you guidance for how to deal 
with what concerns you: ten steps to... Now, you haven’t articulated all your prescriptions, have 
you? Because a lot of your prescriptions are contained in the way you are. They’re set in you. 
You want to get this! This is one of those things you have to get. This conversation’s got to be 
there for the whole Forum.
(pausing)
So you’ve got, for example, golden rules about relations, such as “keep them happy,” “do some-
thing so they’re attached to you,” et cetera. You and I have got great prescriptions. And what 
you can predict out of that is that you and I will get better and better at that. A rat can learn 
how to negotiate a maze by finding a piece of cheese, but will choose a new tunnel if the cheese 
is moved. The difference between a human being and a rat is as follows: a human being will go 
down the tunnel with no cheese forever. You know, you’ve been doing the same shit year after 
year after year, hoping for a different outcome. What you care about is being in the right tunnel, 
regardless of whether there’s cheese or not. Doing the same thing over and over again expecting 
different results. That’s the definition of insanity.
(turning to the chalkboard and indicating the empty space to the left of the X) 
Nobody looks over here, before it happens. 
(writing the word “source”)
That’s where it’s generated, that’s where it’s created. You want to listen up to this next part. Wake 
up! Wake up! When you get to the source of something you are no longer limited by it. That, by 
the way, is a part of how this works: by getting to the source of things. 
(to Wes and Kipp)
I promise that tomorrow I will give them one answer—the answer to what those guys on moun-
taintops in Tibet are looking for.
(pausing)
We’re going to get at concerns from the source side. You don’t get description, definition, 
explanation, and prescription—you just get power. You don’t get a PhD out of here. Plato and 
Socrates killed that kind of research anyway. They tried it and found out it didn’t work. You read

Lee Iacocca and Al Newheart’s books? They would give everything they’ve got if they could give 
what they’ve got to you. Why can’t they? 
(pointing to the right of the X on the chalkboard)
Because they write the book in this language, the language of description, definition, and expla-
nation. Because people don’t buy books they can’t understand. That’s why we took your money 
before you got in here. When I talk about power I’m talking about something like the freedom 
to be, not force, which is the negation of power. I saw a film of a Japanese Judo master, and 
never once saw that man stop to think. And I watched the film over and over. The guys he was 
fighting stopped to think and got thrown. He was acting out of being something. His opponents, 
on the other hand, were acting out of knowing the answers. You see, you can’t throw somebody 
unless they’re set some way. 
(moving away from the board)
We’re going to talk about another critical thing: the listening that you are. I know you’ve got 
questions and comments, and I know some of it didn’t go clunk for you yet. That’s all right. 
We’ll get there. I talk in a language designed and crafted to give access to what concerns you at 
its source. Now I want to talk about the already always listening that you are. What is the listen-
ing you already always are? For the moment, in this conversation, what you are is a listening. 
In the normal course of events, I talk to you like you’re an empty vessel. That isn’t the way it is. 
The vessel’s already full, up to the top. It only admits certain things and it expels other things. It 
changes certain things. You and I are an already always listening.
(pausing)
When I got this distinction already always listening—not a concept or an idea, but a distinction; 
I’m teasing you with that word and you’ll find out about it tomorrow—I began to look at what is 
my already always listening. It was very clear to me. The already always listening I was, was “I 
know.” I was even a bigger pain in the ass in those days, and a smartass to boot. The only thing I 
ever heard was what I already knew. You wake up a certain listening. Your job on this break will 
be to discover the listening which you already always are.
(pausing)
Who can see already what your listening is? 
PARTICIPANT
The already always listening which I am is that I understand you completely. 
ERHARD
Very good.
PARTICIPANT
I’m not good enough.
ERHARD
A lot of us share that one: “The listening I’m going to provide for you is ‘I’m not good enough.’” 
Already Always Listening
This is a core distinction of The Forum, a hint that works together 
with other distinctions (e.g., mood and concern) to relocate 
participants’ understanding of the source of meaning in their 
lives. It asks participants to consider that the way they hear (and 
see) events and people in their lives is a function of their listening, 
rather than being sourced by the people and events themselves. 
It would be possible, of course, to engage in a similar 
conversation using a more familiar psychological model. Such a 
conversation would assert that one’s perceptions are shaped by 
one’s attitudes. This way of framing things would be immediately 
accessible to anyone whose understanding has been shaped by 
th e Cartesian paradigm of an “internal” subject in an objectively 
meaningful world. 
But locating the source of meaning in one’s listening rather 
than in one’s mind situates the process in the world rather than 
“in the heads” of participants. This furthers the development of 
the Heideggerian model of human being as Being-in-the-world. 
Participants in Werner Erhard’s work are frequently coached 
to “stay out of your head,” and to “get present.” In Erhard’s 
vocabulary, “in your head” is equivalent to “in the past.” This is 
where the nature of one’s already always listening is determined: 
one makes decisions about people based on past events (“he’s 
untrustworthy,” “she’s controlling,” “they never listen to me”), and 
these decisions shape the way life occurs in the future. 
Erhard has used the analogy of yellow sunglasses, worn for an 
extended period of time: eventually, you forget that the sunglasses

I’m going to figure out what you’re saying wrong.
ERHARD
There’s a lot of crap in school. I don’t want to put the school system down. I have a lot of 
respect for teachers. But one of the things you find out in school is that you’re either smart or 
dumb. However, there’s no such thing as dumb. I did some work in a school for the disabled. 
One student, Jesse, was considered “uneducable.” It was decided, however, that he was educa-
ble enough to be sent to a school to learn to wash cars. On the day I was there, I was told that 
Jesse had stuffed a teacher in a trash can. As a consequence, he got sent back to the home for 
disabled students, where he could sit around, be friendly, and play. Stupid is a way to survive in 
school. Stupid is an act, a racket.
PARTICIPANT
The already always listening that I am is “I don’t want to and you can’t make me.”
ERHARD
You want to get this. A lot of people listen through “life is hard.” A lot of people listen through 
“life is a burden.” My dentist told me about his experience as a Boy Scout. No matter what the 
scoutmaster had suggested—hiking, swimming, going home—the Scouts always had the same 
response: “OH NOOOOOO!” You are this listening. That’s the clearing you are in which life 
happens. 
PARTICIPANT
Mine is “How can I use this?” “How can I get better?”
ERHARD
Almost everybody’s like that: “How can I use this?” Almost all the power in the world can’t be 
used. People don’t use power. Power uses people.

Great.

My already always listening is “How can I help you? Do you like me now?”
ERHARD
Beautiful.
are the cause of the world’s yellowness. Like the sunglasses, one’s 
way of listening remains invisible because it is always and already 
determining one’s point of view, making the way a situation 
appears become the way things are. The aim of this inquiry is 
for participants to notice these already always ways of listening 
in as much specificity as possible. The Forum proposes that the 
fundamental elements of human listening are widely shared, even 
across cultures; Erhard asserts that there is a “culture of human 
being” that transcends national boundaries. All human beings, 
for example, listen for positive assessments of themselves, and 
for evidence that they are right in their beliefs about the world. 
But individuals develop specific variations, and in this part of The 
Forum dialogue participants are encouraged to discover their own. 
In this way, the dialogue continues to turn participants toward 
themselves in an intensely reflexive process. ■

My already always listening is “I’m very clever and I’ll prove it to you.”
ERHARD
See, there are times when “I’m very clever and I’ll prove it to you” is a very workable listening. 
But if you’re already always “I’m very clever and I’ll prove it to you,” there are a lot of occasions 
that doesn’t match. 
PARTICIPANT
I have several of these. My listening is that “I’m not good enough.”
ERHARD
“I’m not good enough” almost always has got another listening, which is “I’m better than you 
are.” “I’m not good enough but I’m better than you are.” You want to listen up. These guys are 
being authentic about their own inauthenticity. These are not nice people. They are cold, calcu-
lating, conniving people. They are out to get you to like them. And it’s not them. They didn’t in-
vent that. And if this is the opening that I’m providing for the world to occur in, it’s not surpris-
ing how the world shows up. We have done some work facilitating meetings between American 
and Soviet representatives. We discovered that the already always listening of the Americans is 
“You can’t be trusted for your word; now let’s talk.” This made the results predictable.
PARTICIPANT
My always already listening is “I’m too smart and too quick, and I better not let anyone know 
that.”
ERHARD
It’s the “already always way of listening.” I keep losing why the order is important, but there’s 
some significance to the order. What is the already always listening that gives you being the way 
you are? Believe it or not, the way you are is given to you by your listening. 
PARTICIPANT
“You’re boring.”
ERHARD
We’re going to take a break. I want you to consider that the way you are is given to you by your 
listening. I’m inviting you to get down to the already always listening, you know, as deep as you 
can, however deep that happens to be. Clear?

Erhard’s influence on the language of Western culture has been significant. His 
terminology, like Heidegger’s, has always been unusual and highly purposive, and 
many of these words and phrases made their way into the public sphere, some to 
lasting effect. But that language, in its casual use, began to lose its power. Heidegger 
detailed this process of devolution in Being and Time:
SESSION FOUR INTERVAL
I hardly use the word “transformation” at all any more. . . . because 
while it once was a word that people had to think about, struggle 
to grasp, work on, that’s just not true anymore. The word no longer 
wakes people up. Now, when you say “transformation,” the word 
puts them to sleep—like they know what it means—they stop 
thinking, looking, inquiring. 
Instead, he said, as his ontological inquiry has developed, “the notions keep getting 
said differently” (Simon, “Quarterbacks and Coaches: Tossing It Around with Werner 
Erhard,” Family Therapy Networker, March–April 1986, 30–39).
Heidegger addressed his own confrontation with this situation in his essay “A 
Dialogue on Language,” a transcript of his conversation with a Japanese scholar. At 
one point Heidegger (referred to in the transcript as the Inquirer) mentions two of 
the ideas that were central in his early work, hermeneutics and phenomenology.

SPEAKING BEING
In the language which is spoken when one expresses oneself, there 
lies an average intelligibility; and in accordance with this intelligi-
bility the discourse which is communicated can be understood to a 
considerable extent, even if the hearer does not bring himself into 
such a kind of Being towards what the discourse is about as to have 
a primordial understanding of it. We do not so much understand 
the entities which are talked about; we already are listening only to 
what-is-said-in-the-talk as such. What is said in the talk gets under-
stood; but what the talk is about is understood only approximately 
and superficially. . . . Idle talk is the possibility of understanding 
everything without previously making the thing one’s own. . . . Thus, 
by its very nature, idle talk is a closing-off , since to go back to the 
ground of what is talked about is something which it leaves undone. 
(BT 212–213)
“
Erhard’s comments in a 1986 interview, discussing the evolution of his own 
language use, echo Heidegger’s account of the process by which terms lose their 
originative power. Many of the words he had used in his work, Erhard said, “even-
tually drifted into popular use.” They “lost the creative intention behind them and 
degenerated into a kind of jargon.” Outside their original context, as Heidegger put 
it, the terms no longer reached out into the “totality of involvements” in which their 
significance was grounded (BT 200). 
This was the fate of the term “transformation,” a central term to which Erhard 
had assigned “an extremely precise meaning.” Today, he said, “you hear it every-
where. You read about it in business journals. It’s ‘hot.’ So, to some degree, it’s lost 
its potency.” He continued:
[Japanese]: I am all the more puzzled that you have meanwhile 
dropped both words.
[Inquirer]: That was done, not—as is so oft en thought—in order to 
deny the significance of phenomenology, but in order to abandon 
my own path of thinking to namelessness.
[Japanese]: An eff ort with which you will hardly be successful. . . .
[Inquirer]: . . . since one cannot get by in public without rubrics. 
(“DL” in OWL 29)
“
What is essential in both Heidegger’s work and Erhard’s is what is unspoken and 
therefore essentially nameless. Much of Erhard’s work during the four decades of its 
evolution may be seen as the development of new rubrics (distinctions) to replace 
those that have devolved into jargon, such that what is said makes present what 
cannot be said in words.

SPEAKING BEING
The Forum resumed at 10:30 pm. Erhard began by inviting questions from the
participants. One participant, reviewing The Forum, shared that his already always 
listening had altered as a result of that experience.  
ERHARD (addressing the group)
He’s got a possibility beyond his thrown listening. He got it by owning his 
thrown listening. There’s something called getting off  it. This is a sacred thing.
To get off  it is sacred. Now, what does getting off  it mean? It means he’s not 
constrained to entertain that listening. He can hear himself listening and get 
off  that listening. When his already always listening comes up, he is able to 
own it, to embrace it, to be responsible for it. In the normal course of events,
if I found out my already always listening was disempowering I would try to
stop it. He didn’t change it. That’s the big secret. Because when you change it, 
nothing changes.
(shifting tone)
This is a “you-gotta-get-this.” So listen up. 
At the chalkboard, Erhard placed the chalk on the surface and moved it, so that 
the chalk ended in a diff erent place but a line remained indicating the path of its 
movement.
ERHARD (continuing)
Change persists. When you’re diff erent, what persists? That which you’re dif-
ferent than. So when you’re diff erent you’re the same, because the thing from 
which you’re diff erent is still there. The more diff erence, the more persistence. 
If you’re really diff erent, the thing you’re diff erent than has a big persistence. 
If I’m a nice guy as a solution to a problem, the problem for which being a nice
guy is a solution stays in place. About ninety-nine percent of what you are,
you became as a solution to a problem. Education is a solution to being stupid. 
When you solve a problem, what persists is the problem.
(to the participant)
So your listening that altered hadn’t solved the problem of your already always 
listening.
(to the group)
He had embraced it. He was able to be with the problem.

Can you imagine putting two solid objects in the same place at the same time?
If you did that, what would happen? They would disappear. Push them into

the same space—the space between them—and they will disappear. Anything 
you can let be will let you be. There are no accidents of being. You’ve got to be 
there for it, open for it, available for it.
DAVID
I wanted to recognize that I haven’t really been listening. 
ERHARD
Recognition is the beginning. When you recognize your own already always 
listening, you’re on the fi eld. The game’s not over, but you’re on the fi eld.
DAVID
What do I do with my realization?
ERHARD
Nothing. It’ll do something with you. It’ll give you something you didn’t have 
before. Most of you ought to be able to map what David said onto your own 
listening.
Here Erhard called Kipp to the platform to conduct the next exercise; Erhard 
remained nearby, interrupting occasionally to reinforce a point. 
KIPP (to the group) 
Your job is to sit in your chair, and when I say “now,” describe to yourself 
whatever’s happening right now. 
(pausing)
Now.
(a minute of silence)
Okay, plenty of data. Let’s have a few people report what they are experiencing
now.
PARTICIPANT
I’m bored and I don’t want to be here.
PARTICIPANT
I’m analyzing a lot.
ERHARD
It’s not you analyzing, it’s it analyzing, because you can’t stop it.

Forum Day One: Session Five
81
PARTICIPANT
I noticed I was really exhausted.
KIPP
So what you just did was unconceal a fundamental condition that human
beings are. I asked you to sit in your chair and think about what’s happening
right now, and what did you do? By the time you get around to describing
what’s happening right now, it’s gone. Yet everybody stood up authentically, 
honestly, and described what happened then but said it was what is now.
There’s no description available for now. So you’ve got to have the representa-
tion. But what’s present is clearly distinct from the representation. And what it
is to be a human being is not to have that distinction. This is what happened at
the party before you got here. The domains of presence and representation got
collapsed. The moment you say what was happening is what is happening, the
representation starts to shape the presence.
ERHARD
What’s the diff erence between now and your representation of now? You 
can never describe presence because there’s no description in the realm of 
presence. If this isn’t making sense, don’t worry. The valuable stuff  in here
will not make sense. But it’s valid. “Make sense” means “fi ts with what you 
already know.” To get what doesn’t make sense requires thinking. What Kipp 
is trying to get you to get is that you don’t make any distinction between love
as a presence and love as a story. Is there anybody in the room who can’t see 
that existence as a presence is diff erent from existence as a concept or repre-
sentation?
(pausing)
Life exists in the world of concepts and life exists in the world of presence. 
But that’s misleading, because the two get collapsed. Something happens,
like a “what happened.” And that devolves into a concept. What happened
back then is never present like a presence. But that’s not clear to you. You
think you’re dealing with what happened when what you’re really dealing
with is your story about what happened. One is not better than the other. 
The problem is when they get mixed together. This creates a vicious circle: 
the concept of your previous experience now becomes a fi lter for your next 
experience, which is now a little less free because it is conceptually shaped. 
The conceptually shaped experience reinforces the concept; the reinforced 
concept more fully shapes the experience. I’m trying to drive out this seven-
ties bullshit that there’s something wrong with your head. I’m an anti-human 
potentialist. I’m not saying that you’re stuck in the concept. I’m saying that 
you’re stuck in the vicious circle. I don’t want questions. I want to know: 
“Did you get that?”
(pausing)
Good. Everybody got that. So now we’re going to demonstrate what happens 
when you’ve got that distinction. Once you get a distinction, it uses you. Three
distinctions to get: one is the realm of existence called presence. The second is 
the realm of existence called concept or representation. The third is the vicious 
circle. The vicious circle is constructed by a collapse of the fi rst two domains.
(pausing)
We’re going to play a new game. We’re going to do a survey. How many of you 
are tired? 
(a majority of participants raised their hands) 
How many of you have a headache? 
(calling on a young woman named Diane)
Would you be willing to participate in a demonstration? Then please come up
here onto the platform.
Diane sat in the second director’s chair that an assistant placed alongside the fi rst.
ERHARD
Would you be willing to have your headache disappear?
DIANE
Yes. 
ERHARD
And would you be willing to not know why it disappeared? 
DIANE
Okay.
ERHARD
Please close your eyes. How long have you had your headache? 
DIANE
Since before the dinner break.
ERHARD
How big is it?
(hesitating, she holds hands outstretched)
Where is it located? 
(pointing to her left temple)
What color is it?

DIANE (hesitating)
Brown.
ERHARD
If it had a geometric shape, what would it be?
DIANE
Triangular.
ERHARD
How much water would it hold?
DIANE
About a pint.
ERHARD
On a scale of one to ten, where is it?
DIANE
Six and a half.
ERHARD
Why do you have it?
DIANE
Because it’s been a long day.
ERHARD
Headache and long day live in diff erent realms. You have collapsed them. So,
why do you have a headache?
DIANE
Because I’ve been sitting still.
ERHARD
So you’ve got two domains collapsed. Every time I ask you that stupid question 
“Why?” it collapses the two domains.
(repeating this series of questions several times)
How’s your headache now?
DIANE
It’s a four.
ERHARD
How much water would it hold? 
DIANE
Still a pint.
ERHARD
It’s critically important that you get it. The headache now and the headache
a moment ago are collapsed together. When she says the headache is “still” a 
pint, I know she has collapsed the headache now with the representation of 
the headache then.
(continuing to question her regarding the headache’s shape, color and location 
right now)
Do you have a headache?
DIANE
No, I don’t.
ERHARD (to the group)
What happened was, I asked her questions which in order to answer she had
to be in the presence of her headache like a presence.
DIANE
I focused on it.
ERHARD
No! What happened was you got the domains uncollapsed. All that happened
was that the headache, instead of showing up in the vicious circle, showed up
distinct in the domain of presence. You looked at your headache. You were
present to the headache. There are no reasons when the headache is like a
presence.
A second demonstration followed with Patricia, a participant who said she was 
tired. She sat in one of the director’s chairs; Erhard sat on the arm of his, facing 
her. 
ERHARD
How tired are you on a scale from one to ten?

For how many people in the room is nothing starting to move?

How many people are at maybe, can’t tell?

You know where you should be? Where you are?

I’m going to give you an assignment which will determine how much you get 
out of The Forum. I got your money. I can’t lose. You can lose. The point is: 
you have a chance to enhance what you get out of here. Bring your life in here
tomorrow. Don’t bring the face you brought today—the “I’ve got it all togeth-
er” face. Bring in the face that’s authentic about your own inauthenticity. 
What has it cost you in life to collapse those domains? What you’re bringing in 
tomorrow is your inauthenticity. 
(pausing)
We didn’t talk about looking good today, did we? We’re going to do it in 
thirty seconds. You have a major concern for looking good. For some people
looking bad is looking good. So when you come in tomorrow, be able to
talk about where in your life are you used by looking good. Looking good
owns your life. 
(pausing)
The four-day format of this Forum is both an asset and a liability. The 
liability is that there aren’t five days between the weekends for you to be 
back in your lives and talk about your experience. You have got to commu-
nicate what’s happening for you here. You have got to be articulate in this
conversation. Tonight you’ve got to talk about this to other people. You’ve
got to begin to be able to generate the conversation. You’ve got to be able to 
speak this. You don’t have to explain it. You want to be in communication
about this like an experience, like a presence. I know a lot of people who
understand this and don’t live it.
PARTICIPANT
It is very late and I am tired.
PATRICIA
A four. 
ERHARD
Do you know why you are tired? Notice I didn’t ask you “do you think you
k
know why?” I asked if you know why you’re tired.
PATRICIA
No. 
ERHARD
What’s the relationship between the reasons you have for being tired and 
being tired? There isn’t any. The reasons are valid. In other words, in the world
of reasons every reason you have is a valid reason. You don’t have any nutty 
reasons.
(turning to the group and speaking in a loud voice)
There’s no such thing as tired! That’s a concept!
(back to Patricia)
Where in your body are you experiencing what you used to call being tired? 
PATRICIA
My arms.
ERHARD
And where else in your body?
As Erhard repeated the question, she responded each time by identifying a tired 
area of her body.
ERHARD
Nothing much conceptual about this, is there? It’s all presence.
PATRICIA
My arms are still tired.
ERHARD
For a while there you were really looking. But then you got to thinking 
about it. Whenever you say “still” or “also”... See how easy it is to collapse 
the domains?

You were at a four when you started this. Where are you now?

Now that I’ve got your attention. . .

Let me leave you with a reminder. I have already gotten everything I need out

tomorrow regardless of the circumstances, is that clear?

What are you doing at the door with your hat and coat on? You need to be

SPEAKING BEING
the circumstances. There are also moments when we experience freedom from
self-awareness. The diff erence between these two states is relevant to our inquiry 
here. Where does the self live when it is not alive in our awareness?
This leads to the second point made here by Heidegger, one which is generally less 
apparent than the first: self-reflection is at the same time self-production: “The essential 
thing is ‘I will myself’” (EP 64). The human self is not like the human elbow: it is not a 
P
ready-made part of the package that accompanies an infant’s arrival in the world. What 
is included in the package, although not immediately functional, is language, which pro-
vides the material with which we are eventually able to produce a self. But in a world of 
beings with selves, questions about the nature and stability of the self arise persistently,
and recent advances in the study of the human brain, as well as child development, have
informed the inquiry but have not answered the questions. Therefore we note the point 
here as a question to be kept open as The Forum proceeds.
Regarding the phenomenon of reflexion, Heidegger says further that it is “Man’s
settling down in one of his essential places,” and he notes with emphasis that it is 
characterized by “certainty, certainty” (EP 60). That is, for the most part, human
P
beings are made both secure and comfortable by the condition that their self-knowl-
edge provides. While many of us spend considerable time tinkering with the details
of our identities in the interest of self-improvement, on the whole those identities
give us security. On the whole, we are at home in ourselves.
This, at least, is the way of things in the current paradigm. This interpretation 
of the self, however, while self-evident to most of us, is an artifact of a particular way 
t
of understanding human being. Indeed, it has been the dominant understanding for 
several centuries; and while it is increasingly questioned among people who think 
actively about these matters, such as philosophers and other scholars, it remains
the operative understanding for most people in the world—not as something they
bring to mind, or could articulate, but as a way of functioning in their everyday lives.
This particular way of understanding the world, and our place in it, is generally 
known as the Cartesian paradigm. It is so called in recognition of the man in whose 
thinking the model was crystallized, the seventeenth-century French philosopher 
and mathematician Rene Descartes. As a philosopher, Descartes’ job was to engage
in thought experiments; and in one of those experiments—which turned out to be 
significant for all of us—he decided that he would place everything in the world in 
doubt. His purpose in doing this was to discover what, if anything, was indubitable:
what in the world, in the face of committed skepticism, could retain a quality of 
absolute certainty?
END OF DAY ONE INTERVAL
Reflexion: The Cartesian Deficiency
At the outset of Being and Time, Martin Heidegger makes a point that might other-
wise be dismissed as obvious: any inquiry into the nature of Being—such as Werner 
Erhard’s project, or Heidegger’s own—must always be conducted by human beings,
who as far as we can tell are the only beings who have a concern for the matter, as
well as the only ones who are capable of inquiring. Humans are therefore involved
at multiple points in the inquiry—as the beings who are questioning, as the beings of 
whom the question is asked, and as the beings about whom the question is asked.
t
This point is important because of its implications for the inquiry: it will be char-
acterized throughout by reflexion. Reflexion, or self-referentiality, is an important 
idea in the work of both Heidegger and Erhard. The term designates a state in which 
we are turned toward our selves, as when confronting a reflection.
d
Reflexion requires, first of all, self-consciousness. To say that human beings are 
the only beings for whom their being is an issue, is to say that human beings are the 
only beings who are self-conscious—or, to say it more simply, we are the only beings
who have a self. While the consciousness of other animals is likely always to remain
a mystery at some level, it is generally agreed that dogs do not reflect upon their 
 existence. Here, Heidegger emphasizes the centrality of such reflection to human 
awareness:
Consciousness is self-consciousness, and self-consciousness 
is ego-consciousness or “we”-consciousness. The essential
thing in this is the re-flexive, and in it the “I,” “we,” “self,” 
the presentation-to-self and self-production. (EP 64)
P
“
Two points in this passage should be noted. The first, like many points that
arise in an ontological inquiry, can seem at first both apparent and trivial: one’s
consciousness always includes consciousness of one’s self. That is, in being aware
of my world, I am always at some level aware of my self as the center of my aware-
ness. It is worth taking a moment to notice this, because the nature of the self, and
the quality of its presence in human awareness, will become a central topic as The
Forum proceeds. Clearly, there are moments in life when one’s self-consciousness
becomes intensified, resulting in either pleasure or discomfort, depending upon
