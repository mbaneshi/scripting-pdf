SPEAKING BEING
ANGEL
And so I turned it around in my second marriage, where I was happy, but then I created the
divorce so I could be a victim of the divorce.
ERHARD
Watch that word “created”; that gets bandied around by people who have done this work, and
they don’t know what they’re talking about. What happened was: you got divorced. And that
left you deeply unhappy.
ANGEL
The same place I was when I was married before.
ERHARD
Yeah. So you’ve got to get to the point where a fart and having been divorced are on equal levels.
(laughter)r
ANGEL
There’s something very wrong about that. I don’t know what it is...
(laughter)r
Is that really possible?
ERHARD
Yeah it is really possible. They’re both just a “what happened.”
(laughter)r
People who get married sometimes get divorced, true or false?
ANGEL
True.
ERHARD
You got married and you got divorced, true or false?
ANGEL
True.
ERHARD
And that’s what happened. Like a fart.
Forum Day Two: Session Three

ANGEL (lightheartedly)y
There you go invalidating my um...
ERHARD (playing an imaginary violin)
n
Yeah, your zhuuuuuu.
(laughter)r
Okay. Your racket is being a victim. And your racket is being righteous.
ANGEL
And being caring.
ERHARD
Right. And it makes you right and the rest of the world wrong. It allows you to dominate and
allows you to avoid domination of a gutsy being-related-to-somebody.
ANGEL
Yes.
ERHARD
Don’t forget that part. That’s an important part of the payoff . And you got to justify yourself. You
see, “after all I was a good girl.” And what it cost you is, well, my guess is you pay for everything
up there.
(referring to the chalkboard)
You’re so young, maybe you haven’t paid with any of your health, I don’t know, maybe vitality.
Clearly it cost you happiness and love.
ANGEL
Because I thought that was the act of loving someone.
ERHARD
And it is the act, but in that wrong sense. And my guess is that it has cost you some self-expres-
sion. See I don’t know who you are.
ANGEL
I don’t either.
ERHARD
I know who you are not. And that’s right, you don’t know either. And when you get out of here
you can have the fun of fi nding out. And you’ll fi nd out every time you get off  it, and you won’t
156
SPEAKING BEING
fi nd out every time you’re on it. And for you, on it is caring. And feeling deeply. I’ve been doing
this work long enough that I can see behind people’s masks a little bit, and you’re a very beau-
tiful person, but not in the way you think. Not in some airy fairy bullshit sense. But in a really
gutsy sense. Who knows. I can be full of shit too.
(to the group)
There’s no fi nish to this... There’s no “And then she stopped being that!” She’ll be that act for-
ever. And when she’s being that she’ll have a possibility beyond being that. When she’s running
that act there will be no possibility beyond running that act. You got to own being a fake. You’ve
got to be authentic about being inauthentic. Good for you. There ought to be some lightness in
that for you.
ANGEL
It’s incredible. I can’t even describe how it feels to be able to say that I faked caring.
ERHARD
Yeah.
(long, loud applause)
(to the group)
The important part for you is to get how implausible this is, that being able to be that you’re
a fake gives you power. That’s totally implausible. It’s what you’re afraid to be that keeps you
from being. And the worst thing in the whole universe, the worst thing for the last twenty
seven years of Angel’s life would be to be a fake. There couldn’t be anything worse than that.
The nastiest thing she could be. And avoiding being that cost her her life. That’s implausi-
ble, that doesn’t make any sense, and if I told you that yesterday you wouldn’t have gotten it.
You could not have gotten what Angel just did with herself, yesterday. You’re now living in a
diff erent structure of interpretation. You’re dwelling in a diff erent conversation. So you can
tolerate counter commonsensical phenomena: what doesn’t make sense normally—like being
able to be “I don’t care” for a person for whom that is the worst thing you could be—would be
a source of power.
(to Angel)
Anything else?
ANGEL
No, thank you.
ERHARD (to another participant)
Yes?
SOCIAL MOODS
As we pointed out in our discussion of moods in Day One, Heide-
gger says that moods are not individual “psychical” phenomena,
but rather aspects of the way the world is disclosed to Dasein.
He also says that moods can be public:
Publicness, as the kind of Being which belongs
to the “they,” not only has in general its own
way of having a mood, but needs moods and
‘makes’ them for itself. It is into such a mood
and out of such a mood that the orator speaks.
He must understand the possibilities of such
moods in order to rouse them and guide them
aright. (BT 178)
“
In our analysis of The Forum, we are not characterizing Erhard
(or any other Forum leader) as an orator, but as a rhetor, which is
to say simply a person who uses language to some end. Rhetoric
does not have the same formal implications as oratory, and the di-
alogic ontological rhetoric of The Forum is a significantly diff erent
mode of communication from the monologic public speaking of an
orator.
And yet Erhard, in a debriefing with The Forum leaders during
the 1989 Forum, stated that one of the results he had to achieve in
leading The Forum was to “produce some eff ects.” We also know
from our experience that Forum leaders are acutely sensitive to
the mood in The Forum room.
Hubert Dreyfus, in his study of Being and Time, asserts that
in addition to being public, moods can be social, and he quotes
this passage on social moods from a lecture Heidegger delivered
in 1929:
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day Two: Session Three

PARTICIPANT
Can you have more than one act?
ERHARD
Yes. I don’t say you won’t do your old number again. I just say you’re left with a possibility
beyond your old number. Being related is enormously risky. I don’t care what fairy-tale bullshit
you bought into. You’re going to get hurt being related.
(to the group)
There are no answers to being successfully related. And you, assholes, have been looking for the
answer to being successfully related. That’s why you’re assholes. There’s a way to be empowered
and enabled in the face of the risk that being related is. You can bring power and ability to the
risk. You can’t bring answers. There are no formulae, no ten easy steps. Okay. We need to do this
about three times.
Kipp now took the lead in the interactions with participants, but Erhard remained in the conversa-
tion, wandering around at the back of the room and sometimes taking over an interaction that Kipp
had begun.
ERHARD
See, you’re so thrown to the story that you tell the story about the racket, and that will nev-
er give you anything beyond your racket. That’s what the structure of the distinction racket
is for, to break up the story. You die without knowing who you are if you live your life for
approval.
(regarding one participant’s persistent back pain)
You think people are really built that badly?
PARTICIPANT
My racket is I’m scared of doing it wrong. That doesn’t sound right.
ERHARD
That’s a very frequent payoff—avoid the domination of being responsible for. That’s a very
childish concern, but that’s where your racket comes from. Kids’ rackets are avoiding the
domination of being responsible. You are going to be a little boy or little girl until you com-
plete your relationship with your parents. You are not going to grow up until you complete
your relationship with your parents. You are not going to get away with it. I happen to have
had a mother who never made a mistake... only one. I’ll tell you what that was later. This
is one that I know about deeply and profoundly. You are not ever going to make it until
your parents make it with you. No kidding. You just got to get off it with your parents. I’ve
spent most of my life engaged in this question about what it is to be human. What is it that
Moods are not accompanying phenomena;
rather, they are the sort of thing that deter-
mine Being-with-one-another in advance. It
seems as if, so to speak, a mood is in each case
already there, like an atmosphere, in which
we are steeped and by which we are thor-
oughly determined. It not only seems as if this
were so, it is so; and in light of these facts, it is
necessary to dispense with the psychology of
feelings and experiences and consciousness.
(Being in the World 171)
“
Observes Dreyfus: “Heidegger would no doubt appreciate the fact
that we ordinarily say we are in a mood, not that a mood is an
experience in us.”
Having participated in, and observed, a number of Forums, we
know from personal experience that the process can be seen as a
roller-coaster of mood shift s. Erhard tells the participants on the
first day that they should bring their current moods into The Fo-
rum with them, and not try to fix them; so the moods of the partici-
pants are of course at some level individual, though not subjective,
with each participant Being-in-his-or-her-own-world.
But in conjunction with our analysis of Being-with (in the
sidebar with that title in Session One of Day Two), and in light of
our own experience of The Forum, we raise this point about the
nature of social moods. We do so to contrast such moods with the
collective sense of aff inity that inevitably accompanies The Forum
transformation.
Heidegger’s distinction of the publicness of the they-self is
presented as an aspect of Dasein’s fleeing its authentic self. Public-
ness, in that context, characterizes the levelling-down of Dasein’s
possibilities to the average, in the service of its flight from authen-
ticity. We assert that the general mood in The Forum, through its
roller-coaster changes to its ebullient finish, is an aspect of what
it means for the authentic self to appropriate its own inauthentic-
ity, and it diverges greatly from the levelling down the publicness
