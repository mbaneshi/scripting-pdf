JANE
I don’t understand about being complete with your parents.
WES
Are your parents all right with you the way they are?
JANE
Yeah.
WES
So what’s the problem?
ERHARD (gently)
Jane, there’s something going on with you about your parents, isn’t there?  
JANE (very tentative)
I don’t know. 
ERHARD
Does it feel like there is?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
So what’s going on?
JANE
I don’t know. Something from the past?
ERHARD
Is there something that feels badly for you?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
What is it?
JANE
The only thing I can think of is my stepmom, the way they brought her into my life.
THROWNNESS
Thrownness is a central Heideggerian term that Werner Erhard uses
extensively in responding to the first question of The Forum: What
is the Being of human beings? 
In Being and Time, thrownness is a fundamental aspect of 
Dasein’s existence; Erhard calls it “the default clearing” for human 
beings (Author notes, Intro to 6-Day LA 1989). “In thrownness,” 
says Heidegger “it is revealed that in each case Dasein, as my 
Dasein and this Dasein, is already in a definite world and alongside 
a definite range of definite entities within-the-world” (BT 264
T
). 
Thrownness determines Dasein’s options in life, and there are no
others: “As something thrown, Dasein has been thrown into exis-
tence. It exists as an entity which has to be as it is and as it can be”
(BT 321
T
), and further, “it has been brought into its ‘there,’ but not
of its own accord” (BT 329
T
).
The word “thrownness” expresses the way we wound up
being, the way we find ourselves to always already be: thrownness
determines what we automatically are, and it limits our future 
possibilities (what we “can be”). It is the ontological clearing which
Being has sent in our time. “We’ve got only the possibility which 
we inherited,” says Erhard, “the possibility into which we were
thrown—we’re thrown to be this particular way, we’re thrown into 
this kind of being that has this particular set of options” (“The
Heart of the Matter”).
Heidegger says that these options are not objective brute facts 
about the environment into which we are thrown; that would be the 
factuality of the situation, and we might discover those facts if we
y
looked for them. But Dasein’s thrownness “is meant to suggest the 
facticity of its being delivered-over” (BT 174). We live in the facticity, the
T
way we
y
wound up being, and not the factuality; we don’t see the raw 
data of the environment, we see a story about the world. This is our 
y
facticity: that we are thrown, and that our thrownness is not deter-
mined by the things or circumstances “out there.” Rather it is char-
acteristic of Dasein’s way of Being-in-the-world. Dasein has wound
up whatever way it wound up being, and to perpetuate itself, Dasein 
must avoid owning up to what it costs to self-justify this thrown way
of being. From the point of view of the way we 
y
wound up being, then,
