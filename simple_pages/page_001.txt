“Millions have experienced the ideas of Werner Erhard, one of the most incisive 
and insightful thinkers of our generation. This book gives two additional and rare 
opportunities: to read the text of a Forum led by Erhard, and in parallel, to walk with 
a guide to the synergies between Erhard and the thinking of Martin Heidegger.”
