Forum Day Three: Session Three 235
JACOB
I was just thinking if you take the phrase “nothing means anything” in a positive way. The
words are interchangeable. The word nothing means anything; anything is nothing. That
might be the kind of hippy defi nition you don’t like.
ERHARD
True.
JACOB
I know, I know. I don’t like it either, but...
ERHARD
I’ll tell you what I do like, though, is I like that you’re engaged in the conversation. What I
don’t like is being facile about it. Do you know what I mean by the word facile? Live easy with
it.
JACOB
Yeah.
ERHARD
You’ve got to be ballsy with it. You’ve got to get down with this. This is not some airy fairy crap.
I didn’t say you’ve got to talk bad like I do. You’ve got to get down in your own way, but you’ve
got to get down. You’ve got to get out of that “whoooo” shit.
KIPP
And you’ve made it into that. Do you know that?
JACOB
Yeah. What I wanted to say a couple of days ago about doing what you can or can’t do, I think
it was Benjamin Franklin who said...
(forgetting)
ERHARD
I know what they said too, but I can never seem to remember it. We’ll read you that Einstein
quote we butchered later.
(laughter)
JACOB
I remember now. He had a good defi nition of the word character. To have character is to follow
through with the decision after the emotion of making that decision has passed. I thought
that’s what Werner was saying about being facile.

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
What he’s saying is that the way you’re listening to what’s happening in the room is like a
concept. You’re doing the same thing Angel’s doing, just a diff erent meaning. Hers is “As the
Turd Whirls,” and yours is “Fireside Chat with” whatever your name is.
JACOB
Yeah, but the point is, if you don’t change, then it’s not...
KIPP
And this is more of it. This is more Angel coming out of you. Same thing!
JACOB
Yeah.
KIPP
Same thing. Diff erent meaning, that’s all. And you’re attached to those quotes like she’s
attached to the soap opera.
JACOB
Okay, okay, okay.
KIPP
That’s “shut up, shut up, shut up.”
JACOB
I didn’t mean that.
KIPP
Yes you did.
JACOB
I didn’t mean for it.
KIPP
Yeah, that’s the problem. That’s what you’re saying. You see, you don’t want to be with that
it’s empty and meaningless. You’ve got a nice neat package, just like Angel’s got a dramatic
package.
JACOB
And the problem with that is that I’m attracted to that meaning.
KIPP
Attracted to it? You’re addicted to it! That’s all you got.
