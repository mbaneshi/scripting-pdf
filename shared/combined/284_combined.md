SPEAKING BEING
FRED
And at dinner I got to what the cost is, because when I see all the happiness around here, I
just want to push it all down. And what I discovered about how I dominate is I don’t want you
to be happier than I am. So I come in with sad, and I really get sad and I get heavy with the
sadness. But what I also discovered was this incredible disempowerment just all the way down.
If I make a commitment and something happens like I don’t want to fulfi ll that, then I go into
sadness, and then I don’t want to do anything, like the whole bottom falls out. So any joy in my
relationship with my wife? Well I don’t want her to be quite that much happier than I am. I take
away all that joy...
ERHARD
Because if you don’t have sadness, and sadness is the way you dominate and avoid domination...
If you don’t have sadness you lose your weapon. You can’t be happy except tentatively. Just for a
little while maybe. Very good. Continue.
FRED
So also what I’ve looked at: I’ve been talking about having a television show for two years.
To have teenagers and parents interact in a powerful way to get over all this stuff  about clean
rooms. And whenever I get up to speed about that I get sad. And I don’t want to do that. I’m
avoiding the domination of being powerful and making that kind of contribution to the world.
ERHARD
That’s hard to hear—avoid the domination of being powerful. It’s hard to hear.
FRED
I don’t want that domination. I want to be free just in my relationship with my wife. I don’t
want to be dominated by my commitment to her. I want to be away from that. I’ve dominated
with anger, and with depression, and now with sadness.
KIPP
There’s no freedom in wanting to be free. It sounds free but it is the trap. Whatever you can’t be
with has you.
FRED
I found what this was all covering up. I just don’t accept myself. I don’t accept who I am. I have
a tremendous fear of just being with, being with who I am.
KIPP
Yeah but that tremendous fear is what comes with being a human being. You don’t make it up;
it makes you up.
ERHARD
I don’t like the term fear here. I’d like to be a little more precise. It’s really a threat in the form of
the domination. The fear is just a part of it. In other words, your emotional system is going to be
Forum Day Three: Session Four
271
consistent with what your racket is up to. So you’re going to have emotions appropriate to what
your racket is up to. If what your racket is up to is avoiding domination, for you Fred, given the
way you’ve got it structured, it’s going to produce a bit of fear. The fear is not the source of it.
The source of it is avoiding the domination of the responsibility for being powerful and able.
FRED
Thank you...
ERHARD
See if you weren’t frightened, you couldn’t justify avoiding. If you weren’t sad you wouldn’t
have a reason.
(to Kipp)
We didn’t deal with reasons yet have we?
KIPP
No.
ERHARD (jokingly)
Why are we so far behind?
KIPP
That’s one of my issues.
(laughter)
ERHARD
Comes up particularly around me, right? Otherwise he’s fi ne. Around me he’s got this issue.
(returning to the topic)
Very important to get this. I want to cut out this crap of explaining your life on the basis of the
way you feel... Fred is giving you the insight that the way you feel is a product of your racket,
not the other way around. You are not molded by your fear. Your fears are there merely to be
consistent with what your racket is up to, so you have got this kind of justifi cation. You are
not run by your emotions. That’s the apparency. Underneath that, what’s driving things is the
racket.
FRED
Part of what I was looking at was also the inauthenticity/authenticity issue. I had it all wired
that I was absolutely authentic. All I had to do was be around and I was authentic. And when I
could accept the fact that I am inauthentic, not like guilt, or like mortal sin, or like confession...
272
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Hold on. You want to get that. That conversation’s come up in here a lot of times and it’s still
not fl at. Being able to be what you’re afraid you might be gives you power.
FRED
So when I fi nally looked at that I actually had a tremendous feeling of real freedom. I really got
that I’m absolutely inauthentic, it’s just how I am, it’s like telling the truth for the fi rst time,
it gave me a whole playground where I could just be or express or create who I am. I had this
thing tied up with the God issue the lady had brought up before, that I was here on earth to be
the guardian of the playground...
(laughter)
But I couldn’t play. My job was to be this superior, arrogant person who is going to guard and
protect the playground, but I wasn’t going to get to play. But I can’t play. When I fi nally saw that
I’m inauthentic, it was almost a celebration. It’s great! I’m inauthentic. Now there’s a place to
start from to fi nd out who I really am.
ERHARD
Don’t misinterpret what Fred is saying. He means what he says but don’t listen to it wrong. He’s
saying, “embracing what you’re afraid you might be gives you power.” He didn’t say, “make
being inauthentic right.” He said he was able to embrace it. That he was able to be in the face of
it. Whatever you can be with lets you be. Whatever you can’t be with won’t let you be.
FRED
So it’s like a...
ERHARD
It’s almost starting to get clear in here. It’s like “yeah, yeah, I know that, why are you saying it
again?”
FRED
And so it’s like this whole new sense of freedom. You know before The Forum my wife was
telling me, “Fred, you don’t know who you are.” That made me furious. And the truth is I don’t
know who I am. And to be able to get that I’m inauthentic, that’s the most freedom I think I’ve
ever had.
KIPP
It is the most freedom you’ve ever had.
FRED
I was looking at the issue of the empty and meaningless. I’m not sure that I have that like I have
“inauthentic.” And I want to interact for a moment to get it...
“
might be gives you power.
Forum Day Three: Session Four
273
ERHARD
Hold on a second. You notice he didn’t say he was confused. You want to listen that he’s
saying the same things a lot of other people have said in here. Talking about not quite getting
something yet. But he’s talking about it, he has framed it, he’s construed it, he’s spoken it so that
there’s an opening for him to get it. Rather than a way that there is no opening for him to get it
so that Kipp has to beat him up to get him to get it.
FRED
So what I was looking at, the possibility that empty and meaningless, if we had the opposite
of that, if life was full and fulfi lling there would be no space for me to come up, to express
myself, to be fully blown as a human being, in the sense that I would be spending all my time
trying to fi nd out what’s the meaning of life if it’s already so full? I’m looking at empty and
meaninglessness as a place to start from like it’s empty, it’s open.
ERHARD
Here’s the problem in that. It’s one of the problems Kipp and I have in leading The Forum.
This empty and meaningless you’ve got to get just like it is. You can’t get it as a place to start.
If you’re getting it like a place to start you’re getting it in-order-to. You’ve got to kill hope.
Otherwise your life is going to be full of hopelessness. See the one thing that goes away with
hope... When you suff er the pain of getting rid of hope, the other thing that goes away with it
is “hopeless.” We’re going to get a little deeper into this business about empty and meaningless
and take a look at what the structure is. If it’s all empty and meaningless then how did all this
crap happen? Everyone’s seen enough crap to be clear about the amount of crap there is? We
don’t need to do more crap in here?
Erhard stopped to acknowledge a participant for how diff erent she looked from the fi rst day.
ERHARD (continuing)
In Fred’s straight talk about it, I want you to get that you’ve got to get it just to get it, not in-
order-to. See if there’s an iota of getting out of the trap in your getting it, you didn’t get it. You
gotta go through the despair, you gotta go through whatever emotion you have, or whatever
mood you’ve got about it. You’ve got to get it cleanly. You can’t get it knowing that there’s going
to be a way out, because the way out is the way in. See if you get it knowing there’s going to be a
way out, you didn’t get it because you got it in a way that’s going to keep you in. I had forgotten
who I was talking to over here in the last session, what I said, that the attempt to get out of the
trap... you know, what makes Californians silly is their attempt to get out of the trap, because
the attempt to get out of the trap is being in the trap. What it is to be in the trap is to try to get
out of the trap. You can’t get out if you try, because trying to get out is part of the trap. You read
the right books, and they tell you that. Okay, so you fi gure, I’m going to give up trying to get out
of the trap. Well, that’s part of the trap. See, you can’t get out if you try, because trying to get
out is being in the trap. And you can’t get out if you don’t try. There’s no getting out of the trap.
There’s no way to win this game; you can’t beat this one. You’ve got to be able to be in the trap.
Every one of those words was chosen very carefully. You should listen to them very rigorously.
Giving up, surrendering to the trap: won’t work. All that’ll do is leave you in the trap. Trying to
“
When you suff er the pain of getting rid of
hope, the other thing that goes away with
it is ‘hopeless.’
274
SPEAKING BEING
get out of the trap won’t work because the trap is constructed in such a way that the attempts to
get out are the very bars of the trap. That’s what keeps you in the trap. You can’t get out if you
try, and you can’t get out if you don’t try. You’ve got to be able to be in the trap. You know, you
can’t write that. That’s oral. If you read it, it sounds like I said you’ve got to be able to be in the
trap. No. I said you’ve got to be able to be in the trap. You’ve got to fi nd freedom in the ropes:
full, total, absolute freedom in the ropes. You’ve got to fi nd freedom in your asshole-ness. Find
freedom in the racket. Not avoiding the racket, not running the racket, not indulging yourself
in the racket. “Okay, I’ll just do my racket.” That’s trapped. You’ve just surrendered to it, given
up to the racket. Trying not to do your racket will just be a new racket, even if you succeed at it,
which you probably won’t. Very, very rarely do people succeed at not doing their racket, and if
you did succeed that would just be your new racket. Your new racket would be not doing your
racket. Lots of people around here like that. They’re Enlightened. You’re the kind of people who
fall in holes or get hit by busses. So, no in-order-to. It’s empty and meaningless. And it’s empty
and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless. It doesn’t mean anything that it doesn’t
mean anything. It just doesn’t mean anything and it doesn’t mean anything that it doesn’t mean
anything. And it isn’t going to work out. It isn’t going to work out because it already worked out.
You think it’s going to work out someday. The right woman is not going to come along someday,
the one who’s blonde and naked on a horse. You’re gonna be stuck with the one you got. You
aren’t going to make it. There’s no making it. And you got plenty of evidence for that already. A
lot of people in this room have a lot of making it already. There are no failures in here. We could
go down the street and fi nd people whose lives are desperate due to their failures. Everyone
in here is pretty successful in dealing with life. You’re pretty stupid, but you’re successful at
dealing with life. We’ve made it this far despite our stupidity. Evidence that the stupid do make
it... At any rate... So no cheating. You can’t cheat your way out of this. You’ve got to lose and
then be able to be.
FRED
It looks like... I don’t know if that’s as far as I can take it. That’s what is. Like there’s no
supporting, no stuff  around it.
ERHARD
Yeah. It’s called the existential moment of truth: naked and without any support. You’ve got to
be able to be there. You’ve got to be able to be with nothing underneath you. You won’t make it.
You won’t make it in The Forum. It’ll take years for you to get that. Fred and I have been working
together a long time, pretty intensively. He’s a real good guy. It’s hard to tell when he talks about
himself. You don’t get it all when you open it up. We’re opening it up in here. This is kindergarten.
But it’s started. This is an experience over which you will never get. You’ll hear me talking for
years. What you’ll never get over is knowing that you’ve got a choice. I know you don’t know
what choice means yet, but you’ll never get over that. No matter how fucked up you get, that
you’ll never get over. Still lots of work to do. And you’ll do it if you see it as a privilege to do that
work.  If you can’t see what an extraordinary opportunity it is to do this work, then you ought
to complete The Forum and get every ounce of value you can get out of it, and there’s plenty
of value there to get, and you ought to go on your merry way. That’s a fair deal. You paid for it.
You’re not obligated to do anything; you haven’t joined anything because there’s nothing to join.
“
Giving up, surrendering to the trap: won’t
work. All that’ll do is leave you in the trap.
Trying to get out of the trap won’t work
because the trap is constructed in such a
way that the attempts to get out are the
very bars of the trap. That’s what keeps
you in the trap. You can’t get out if you
try, and you can’t get out if you don’t try.
You’ve got to be able to be in the trap.
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day Three: Session Four
275
FRED
When I made out my list of items for doing The Forum, I put down twenty-six individual,
separate, items on the form I fi lled out for The Forum. And as I shared my detailed list with the
lady I spoke to when I registered, she was aghast. What is driving me in the direction of twenty-
six items that need to get handled otherwise my life isn’t... Where is the value in me standing up
here?
KIPP
Not in those twenty-six items.
FRED
Yeah, I got that far.
ERHARD
Who said there was any value? Who said there was supposed to be any value? Who said that life
was about value?
FRED
Um, that if I accomplish those things, then I would be of value.
ERHARD
No you wouldn’t. You’d be a guy walking around saying I accomplished those twenty-six things
and now I have value. Nothing wrong with that.
FRED
Yeah.
ERHARD
Who said that those things were of value, was you.
FRED
Yeah, I did.
ERHARD
He made that up. It’s okay with me that he made that up. But he’s not the Pope, and the Pope
doesn’t say that. He said that. The only problem with it is if he believes in it, if he believes
that it’s true. If he believes that he said that and that’s the game he’s playing, that’s wonderful.
You don’t have any value. You’re nothing. Nothing and bullshit. No value. And you’ve got a
mouth. And you can say, “I’ve got these twenty-six projects, twenty-six commitments, and
accomplishing them gives me value, because I said so.” Let me ask you a question. Is a ball
in a hole at one end of a fi eld more valuable than a ball on the top of a little stick at the other
end of the fi eld? Which is the more valuable condition? A ball in a hole? Or a ball on a stick?
A lot of people think that God said that balls in holes are better than balls on sticks. They’re
called golfers. They think that it is that way, and not that someone made it up... If you forget
276
SPEAKING BEING
that you say so, you do get nutty about it instead of having fun. So yeah, your twenty-six things:
wonderful as long as they belong to you.
FRED
I just had the thought standing up here, that if I have so many things going on then I can avoid
domination. Because I could always say “I’m too busy. I’ve got this meeting to go to so I can’t go
to this other meeting.”
ERHARD
Lots of people too busy to do anything. Who in here is too busy to do anything? “I don’t get to
accomplish anything because I’m too busy.”
FRED
I gave up the twenty-six items and I saw that there’s no satisfaction in them. I’m driven to them,
and there’s no sense of empowerment. So I’m actually looking at the wonder of complacency.
That it might be just wonderful to go home and watch TV, have a beer and forget about my
twenty-six items. There might be more authenticity in relaxing, watching TV with a beer than
scrambling after my twenty-six items.
ERHARD
Yeah, and neither one of them is going to get you anyplace.
(pausing)
And you’re actually going to do what you’re going to do anyhow, not what you contemplate
doing. You haven’t got much choice about it. In fact, none. You can only do what you do; you
can’t do what you don’t do. As soon as I fi nd someone who has done what they didn’t do, we’re
going to stop doing The Forum because it’ll be bullshit. So far, looking through half a million
people, we haven’t found anybody who did what they didn’t do. Everyone’s only done what
they did.
(to another participant sitting)
Get that? You ever do anything you didn’t do? You only do what you do, right?
PARTICIPANT
I do what I want to do.
ERHARD
You do what you want to do?
PARTICIPANT
Always.
ERHARD
Always?
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day Three: Session Four
277
(to another participant sitting next to the participant who said she does what she wants to do)
Sit on her lap, or hold her arms down, or something.
(the other participant sits on the fi rst participant’s lap)
Now: want to stand up.
(the participant cannot stand up)
So, you don’t always do what you want to do. And you don’t do what you like to do. You do what
you do. That’s all you ever do. You’ve always done what you did, and sometimes coincidentally,
from time to time it happens to be what you wanted to do.
PARTICIPANT
That’s nonsense.
ERHARD
It is nonsensical.
PARTICIPANT
Then why do The Forum?
ERHARD
That’s what I said. We’re going to stop doing The Forum as soon as I fi nd someone who did
something they didn’t do.
A participant named Kevin stood, who, during Erhard’s conversation with Jacob in the previous
session, had complained that the camera pointing at Jacob was also pointing at people in the “no-
video” section.
KEVIN
I came to The Forum very skeptical of the whole thing. My feeling was that I would probably
get something out of it. I was sure I was going to have to go through so much bullshit I wasn’t
sure I was going to last it out. As it turned out that was partially true, because I, like a bunch of
other people, I sense, I felt like we were being sold the next session at every opportunity. But at
this point in the game I’m willing to accept that too. It wasn’t as bad as I thought it was going
to be. I didn’t really start to get into this until yesterday, or maybe it was today. In searching for
my racket, I just couldn’t seem to fi nd my racket. But during the sharing, I had the feeling that
every single person who stood, everyone’s racket seemed to be my racket. I couldn’t believe it.
Today I guess I made a breakthrough.
WES
Hold on. I want to complete this stuff  about “I guess I had a breakthrough.” I don’t mean even
the “guess” part. Where are you looking to declare a breakthrough? Where does breakthrough
occur?

فرد
و در شام به من رسیدم که هزینه چیست ، زیرا وقتی همه شادی ها را در اینجا می بینم ، من
فقط می خواهم همه آن را به پایین فشار دهم. و آنچه من در مورد چگونگی تسلط فهمیدم این است که شما را نمی خواهم
شادتر از من باشم. بنابراین من با غم و اندوه وارد می شوم و واقعاً غمگین می شوم و با
غم و اندوه اما آنچه که من نیز کشف کردم این قدرت باورنکردنی بود که تمام راه را پایین می آورد. اگر تعهد کنم و اتفاقی می افتد مثل اینکه نمی خواهم آن را برآورده کنم ، پس وارد می شوم
غم و اندوه ، و سپس من نمی خواهم کاری انجام دهم ، مثل این که کل پایین از بین می رود. بنابراین هر شادی در من
رابطه با همسرم؟ خوب من نمی خواهم او بسیار خوشحال تر از من باشد. من می گیرم
همه آن شادی را دور ... erhard
از آنجا که اگر غم و اندوه ندارید ، و غم و اندوه راهی است که تسلط می کنید و از سلطه خودداری می کنید ... اگر غم و اندوه ندارید سلاح خود را از دست می دهید. شما نمی توانید خوشحال باشید به جز آزمایشی. فقط برای یک
کمی ممکن است خیلی خوب ادامه فرد
بنابراین آنچه من به آن نگاه کردم: من دو سال در مورد داشتن یک برنامه تلویزیونی صحبت کرده ام. داشتن نوجوانان و والدین در تعامل با روشی قدرتمند برای دستیابی به این همه چیز در مورد تمیز
اتاق ها و هر وقت من در مورد آن سرعت می گیرم ، ناراحت می شوم. و من نمی خواهم این کار را انجام دهم. من هستم
اجتناب از تسلط قدرتمند بودن و ایجاد آن نوع سهم در جهان. درز
شنیدن این کار دشوار است - از تسلط قدرتمند بودن. شنیدن آن دشوار است فرد
من آن سلطه را نمی خواهم. من می خواهم فقط در رابطه با همسرم آزاد باشم. من نمی کنم
می خواهم تحت سلطه تعهد من به او باشم. من می خواهم از آن دور باشم. من تسلط دارم
با عصبانیت ، و با افسردگی و اکنون با غم و اندوه. کله
هیچ آزادی در تمایل به آزاد بودن وجود ندارد. به نظر می رسد رایگان است اما تله است. هرچه نمی توانید باشید
با شما فرد
فهمیدم که این همه پوشش داده شده است. من خودم را نمی پذیرم. من قبول نمی کنم که هستم. من دارم
ترس فوق العاده ای از فقط بودن با بودن ، بودن با من. کله
بله اما این ترس فوق العاده همان چیزی است که با یک انسان بودن همراه است. شما آن را تشکیل نمی دهید.
این شما را بالا می برد. درز
من اصطلاح ترس را در اینجا دوست ندارم. من می خواهم کمی دقیق تر باشم. این واقعاً یک تهدید در قالب است
سلطه ترس فقط بخشی از آن است. به عبارت دیگر ، سیستم عاطفی شما قرار است
روز اول انجمن: جلسه چهارم
271
مطابق با آنچه راکت شما است. بنابراین شما می خواهید احساسات متناسب با چه چیزی داشته باشید
راکت شما به پایان رسیده است. اگر آنچه راکت شما به آن توجه می کند ، از سلطه جلوگیری می کند ، برای شما فرد ، با توجه به
راهی که ساختار یافته اید ، می تواند کمی ترس ایجاد کند. ترس منبع آن نیست. منبع آن جلوگیری از تسلط بر مسئولیت قدرتمند و توانایی است. فرد
متشکرم ... erhard
ببینید که آیا شما وحشت نکرده اید ، نمی توانید از اجتناب توجیه کنید. اگر ناراحت نبودید
دلیل داشته باشید (به KIPP)
ما هنوز با دلایلی برخورد نکرده ایم؟ کله
شماره erhard (شوخی)
چرا ما اینقدر عقب هستیم؟ کله
این یکی از مسائل من است (خنده)
درز
به خصوص در اطراف من ظاهر می شود ، درست است؟ در غیر این صورت او fi ne است. در اطراف من او این مسئله را پیدا کرده است. (بازگشت به موضوع)
برای به دست آوردن این موضوع بسیار مهم است. من می خواهم این تله توضیح زندگی شما را بر اساس
راهی که احساس می کنید ... فرد این بینش را به شما می دهد که روشی که احساس می کنید محصولی از راکت شماست ،
نه راه دیگر. شما از ترس خود شکل نمی گیرید. ترس های شما صرفاً وجود دارد
مطابق با آنچه راکت شما در نظر گرفته شده است ، بنابراین شما این نوع کاتیون توجیهی را بدست آورده اید. شما هستید
توسط احساسات خود اداره نمی شود. این ظاهر است در زیر آن ، آنچه را که رانندگی می کند این است
راکت فرد
بخشی از آنچه من به آن نگاه می کردم نیز مسئله عدم اطمینان/اصالت بود. من همه آن را سیمی داشتم
که من کاملاً معتبر بودم. تمام کاری که من باید انجام دهم این بود که در اطراف باشم و معتبر بودم. و وقتی من
می تواند این واقعیت را بپذیرد که من غیر معتبر هستم ، مثل گناه ، یا مانند گناه فانی ، یا مانند اعتراف ... 272
وجود
درز
نگه داشتن شما می خواهید آن را دریافت کنید. این مکالمه بارها و بارها به اینجا می آید و هنوز هم است
نه در قادر به آنچه می ترسید ممکن است به شما قدرت بدهد. فرد
بنابراین وقتی من به طور کلی نگاه کردم که در واقع احساس فوق العاده ای از آزادی واقعی داشتم. من واقعاً گرفتم
که من کاملاً غیر معتبر هستم ، این دقیقاً من هستم ، مثل این است که برای اولین بار حقیقت را بگویم ،
این یک زمین بازی کامل به من داد که من فقط می توانم باشم یا بیان کنم یا کسی را که هستم ایجاد کنم. من این را داشتم
چیزی که با مسئله خدا که خانم قبلاً مطرح کرده بود ، گره خورده است ، که من اینجا روی زمین بودم تا باشم
The Guardian of the Playground ... (خنده)
اما من نتوانستم بازی کنم. کار من این بود که این شخص برتر و متکبر باشم که قصد محافظت از آن را دارد و
از زمین بازی محافظت کنید ، اما من نمی خواهم بازی کنم. اما من نمی توانم بازی کنم. وقتی که من آن را دیدم
من غیر معتبر هستم ، تقریباً یک جشن بود. عالی است من غیر معتبر هستم اکنون مکانی برای
از طریق شروع کنید تا من واقعاً چه کسی هستم. درز
آنچه را که فرد می گوید اشتباه نکنید. او به معنای آنچه او می گوید اما اشتباه به آن گوش ندهید. او
گفتن ، "در آغوش آنچه می ترسید ممکن است به شما قدرت بدهد." او نگفت ، "درست کن
حق غیرقانونی بودن. " او گفت که قادر به پذیرش آن است.
آن هرچه می توانید با آن باشید به شما اجازه می دهد. هرچه با آن نتوانید با شما اجازه ندهید به شما اجازه ندهید. فرد
بنابراین مثل یک erhard است
تقریباً در اینجا روشن می شود. مثل "بله ، بله ، من این را می دانم ، چرا آن را می گویید
دوباره؟ "
فرد
و بنابراین این مانند این حس کاملاً جدید آزادی است. شما می دانید قبل از انجمن همسرم بود
به من گفت ، "فرد ، شما نمی دانید چه کسی هستید." این باعث خشم من شد. و حقیقت این است که من نمی کنم
بدانید من کی هستم و برای اینکه بتوانم به این نتیجه برسم که من غیرقانونی هستم ، این بیشترین آزادی است که فکر می کنم من
تا به حال داشته است کله
این بیشترین آزادی شما تا به حال بوده است. فرد
من به مسئله خالی و بی معنی نگاه می کردم. من مطمئن نیستم که من چنین چیزی را دارم
"غیر معتبر". و من می خواهم برای یک لحظه در تعامل باشم تا آن را بدست آورم ... "
ممکن است به شما قدرت بدهد. روز اول انجمن: جلسه چهارم
273
درز
یک ثانیه نگه دارید. متوجه می شوید که او نگفت که او گیج شده است. شما می خواهید گوش دهید که او هست
گفتن همین موارد بسیاری از افراد دیگر در اینجا گفته اند. صحبت در مورد نه کاملاً گرفتن
چیزی هنوز اما او در مورد آن صحبت می کند ، او آن را قاب کرده است ، او آن را تفسیر کرده است ، او به گونه ای صحبت کرده است که
یک دهانه برای او وجود دارد. به جای راهی که هیچ باز برای او وجود ندارد
به طوری که کیپ مجبور است او را مورد ضرب و شتم قرار دهد تا او را به دست آورد. فرد
بنابراین آنچه که من به آن نگاه می کردم ، این احتمال وجود دارد که خالی و بی معنی باشد ، اگر برعکس باشد
از این ، اگر زندگی پر بود و برآورده می شد ، هیچ فضایی برای آمدن من وجود نخواهد داشت تا بیان کنم
خودم ، که به عنوان یک انسان کاملاً منفجر شوم ، به این معنا که تمام وقت خود را می گذرانم
اگر قبلاً اینقدر پر باشد ، تلاش می کنید معنای زندگی چیست؟ من به خالی نگاه می کنم و
بی معنی بودن به عنوان مکانی برای شروع مانند خالی است ، باز است. درز
این مشکل در آن است. این یکی از مشکلاتی است که من و کیپ در پیشبرد این انجمن داریم. این خالی و بی معنی شما باید دقیقاً مانند آن بدست آورید. شما نمی توانید آن را به عنوان مکانی برای شروع بدست آورید. اگر آن را مانند مکانی برای شروع به کار می گیرید ، آن را به صورت سفارش می دهید. شما باید امید را بکشید. در غیر این صورت زندگی شما پر از ناامیدی خواهد بود. چیزی را که از بین می رود ببینید
امیدوارم ... وقتی درد از خلاص شدن از امید را تحمل می کنید ، چیز دیگری که با آن از بین می رود
"ناامید" است. ما می خواهیم در مورد خالی و بی معنی کمی عمیق تر به این تجارت بپردازیم
و نگاهی بیندازید که ساختار چیست. اگر این همه خالی و بی معنی است ، پس چگونه این کار را انجام داد
تله اتفاق می افتد؟ همه به اندازه کافی تلخه دیده می شوند تا در مورد میزان تله ای که وجود دارد روشن باشد؟ ما
نیازی به انجام تله بیشتر در اینجا نیست؟ Erhard متوقف شد تا یک شرکت کننده را تصدیق کند که چقدر متفاوت از روز اول به نظر می رسد. erhard (ادامه)
در صحبت مستقیم فرد در مورد آن ، من می خواهم که شما را بدست آورید که باید آن را بدست آورید تا آن را بدست آورید ، نه
ترتیب به ببینید آیا یک IOTA برای خارج شدن از تله در گرفتن آن وجود دارد ، شما آن را دریافت نکردید. شما
باید ناامیدی را طی کنید ، شما باید هر احساسی را که دارید یا هر چیز دیگری را پشت سر بگذارید
روحیه ای در مورد آن دارید. شما باید آن را به صورت تمیز دریافت کنید. شما نمی توانید آن را بدانید که وجود دارد
برای رسیدن به یک راه ، زیرا راه خروج است.
راه بیرون ، شما آن را به دست نیاوردید زیرا آن را به شکلی که شما را نگه می دارد ، فراموش کرده ام. من فراموش کرده ام
من در آخرین جلسه با چه کسی در اینجا صحبت می کردم ، آنچه گفتم ، تلاش برای خارج شدن از
تله ... می دانید ، آنچه کالیفرنیایی ها را احمق می کند تلاش آنها برای بیرون آمدن از تله است ، زیرا
تلاش برای خارج شدن از تله در دام است. آنچه در دام است ، تلاش برای بدست آوردن است
خارج از تله. اگر سعی می کنید نمی توانید بیرون بروید ، زیرا تلاش برای بیرون آمدن بخشی از تله است. شما خواندید
کتابهای مناسب ، و آنها این را به شما می گویند. باشه ، بنابراین شما از این کار می کنید ، من می خواهم از تلاش برای بیرون آمدن خودداری کنم
از تله خوب ، این بخشی از دام است. ببینید ، اگر سعی کنید ، نمی توانید بیرون بروید ، زیرا سعی در دریافت
بیرون در دام است. و اگر سعی نکنید نمی توانید بیرون بروید. از دام خارج نمی شود. هیچ راهی برای پیروزی در این بازی وجود ندارد. شما نمی توانید این یکی را بزنید. شما باید بتوانید در دام باشید. هر یک از این کلمات با دقت انتخاب شد. شما باید خیلی سخت به آنها گوش دهید. تسلیم شدن ، تسلیم شدن به تله: کار نمی کند. تمام کاری که انجام می شود این است که شما را در دام بگذارید. در تلاش
"
هنگامی که شما از درد ناشی می شوید
امیدوارم ، چیز دیگری که از بین می رود
این "ناامید" است.
274
وجود
از تله خارج شوید زیرا تله به گونه ای ساخته شده است که تلاش ها انجام شود
بیرون بروید ، کافه های تله است. این همان چیزی است که شما را در دام نگه می دارد. اگر نمی توانید بیرون بروید
سعی کنید ، و اگر سعی نمی کنید نمی توانید بیرون بروید. شما باید بتوانید در دام باشید. شما می دانید ، شما
نمی توانم آن را بنویسم این شفاهی است اگر آن را بخوانید ، به نظر می رسد که من گفتید که باید در آن حضور داشته باشید
تله نه. من گفتم شما باید بتوانید در دام باشید. شما باید در طناب ها به آزادی تبدیل شوید:
آزادی کامل ، کامل ، مطلق در طناب ها. شما باید در آزادی خود به آزادی تبدیل شوید. پیدا کردن
آزادی در راکت. اجتناب از راکت ، نه اجرای راکت ، عدم تحمل خود
در راکت "خوب ، من فقط راکت خود را انجام خواهم داد." این به دام افتاده است شما فقط تسلیم آن شده اید ، داده شده است
تا راکت. تلاش برای انجام کار راکت خود فقط یک راکت جدید خواهد بود ، حتی اگر در آن موفق شوید ،
که احتمالاً شما نخواهید داشت. بسیار ، به ندرت مردم موفق می شوند راکت خود را انجام ندهند ، و اگر
شما موفق شدید که فقط راکت جدید شما خواهد بود. راکت جدید شما شما را انجام نمی دهد
راکت بسیاری از افراد در اینجا مانند این. آنها روشنگری هستند شما نوع افرادی هستید که
در سوراخ ها سقوط کنید یا با اتوبوس ها ضربه بزنید. بنابراین ، بدون سفارش. خالی و بی معنی است و خالی است
و بی معنی است که خالی و بی معنی است. این به معنای چیزی نیست که این کار را انجام نمی دهد
به معنای هر چیزی است. این فقط به معنای چیزی نیست و به معنای چیزی نیست که به معنای آن نیست
هر چیزی و این کار نمی کند. این کار به نتیجه نمی رسد زیرا قبلاً کار کرده است. شما فکر می کنید روزی کار می کند. زن مناسب قرار نیست روزی بیاید ،
کسی که بلوند و برهنه روی اسب است. شما با کسی که گرفتید گیر خواهید کرد. شما
نمی خواهید آن را بسازید. هیچ ساختمانی وجود ندارد. و شما در حال حاضر شواهد زیادی برای آن دریافت کرده اید. بوها
بسیاری از افراد در این اتاق قبلاً آن را ساخته اند. در اینجا هیچ خرابی وجود ندارد. ما می توانیم
به خیابان بروید و افرادی که زندگی آنها به دلیل نارسایی هایشان ناامید است. هر کس
در اینجا در برخورد با زندگی بسیار موفق است. شما بسیار احمق هستید ، اما در آن موفق هستید
برخورد با زندگی ما علی رغم حماقت ما ، این کار را تاکنون انجام داده ایم. شواهدی که احمقانه می سازند
این ... به هر حال ... بنابراین بدون تقلب. شما نمی توانید راه خود را از این کار تقلب کنید. شما باید باخت و
سپس قادر به بودن باشید. فرد
به نظر می رسد ... من نمی دانم که آیا این تا آنجا که می توانم آن را بگیرم. این همان چیزی است که مثل اینکه وجود ندارد
پشتیبانی ، هیچ چیز اطراف آن نیست. درز
بله آن را لحظه وجودی حقیقت: برهنه و بدون هیچ گونه پشتیبانی. شما باید
قادر به حضور در آنجا باشید. شما باید بتوانید با چیزی در زیر خود باشید. شما آن را نمی سازید. شما آن را در انجمن نمی سازید. سالها طول می کشد تا این کار را بدست آورید. من و فرد کار کرده ایم
مدت زمان طولانی ، بسیار شدید. او یک پسر خوب خوب است گفتن وقتی درباره او صحبت می کند دشوار است
خودش. شما وقتی آن را باز می کنید ، همه چیز را دریافت نمی کنید. ما آن را در اینجا باز می کنیم. این مهد کودک است. اما شروع شده است این تجربه ای است که هرگز به آن نخواهید رسید. شما می شنوید که من برای آن صحبت می کنم
سالها آنچه هرگز به دست نمی آورید این است که بدانید که انتخابی دارید. من می دانم که شما نمی دانید
چه انتخابی هنوز به معنای آن است ، اما شما هرگز به این نتیجه نخواهید رسید. مهم نیست که چقدر لعنتی می کنید ، که
شما هرگز به دست نخواهید آمد. هنوز کارهای زیادی برای انجام دادن و اگر آن را به عنوان یک امتیاز برای انجام این کار می بینید این کار را خواهید کرد
کار اگر نمی توانید ببینید چه فرصتی خارق العاده انجام این کار است ، پس باید
برای تکمیل انجمن و به دست آوردن هر اونس از ارزش شما می توانید از آن خارج شوید ، و تعداد زیادی وجود دارد
از ارزش آنجا برای بدست آوردن ، و شما باید به روش شاد خود بروید. این یک معامله عادلانه است شما هزینه آن را پرداخت کردید شما موظف نیستید کاری انجام دهید. شما به چیزی پیوسته اید زیرا هیچ چیز برای پیوستن وجود ندارد. "
تسلیم شدن ، تسلیم تله:
کار تمام کاری که انجام می شود این است که شما را در دام بگذارید. تلاش برای خارج شدن از تله کار نمی کند
زیرا تله در چنین ساخته شده است
راهی که تلاش برای بیرون آمدن است
کافه های تله. این چیزی است که نگه می دارد
تو در دام اگر نمی توانید بیرون بروید
سعی کنید ، و اگر سعی نمی کنید نمی توانید بیرون بروید. شما باید بتوانید در دام باشید. erhard (ادامه)
روز اول انجمن: جلسه چهارم
275
فرد
وقتی لیست موارد خود را برای انجام انجمن تهیه کردم ، بیست و شش فرد را کنار گذاشتم ،
موارد جداگانه ، در فرم I که برای انجمن انتخاب شده ام. و همانطور که لیست مفصل خود را با
خانم من وقتی ثبت نام کردم با او صحبت کردم ، او AGHAST بود. چه چیزی مرا به سمت بیست و
شش موردی که باید مورد استفاده قرار گیرند ، در غیر این صورت زندگی من نیست ... ارزش من در من ایستاده است
اینجا؟ کله
نه در آن بیست و شش مورد. فرد
بله ، من آنقدر دور شدم. درز
چه کسی گفت ارزش وجود دارد؟ چه کسی گفت قرار است ارزشی داشته باشد؟ چه کسی گفت که زندگی
در مورد ارزش بود؟ فرد
ام ، که اگر من آن کارها را انجام دهم ، من ارزش خواهم داشت. درز
نه شما نمی خواهید شما یک پسر خواهید بود که می گوید من این بیست و شش چیز را انجام داده ام
و اکنون من ارزش دارم. هیچ مشکلی با آن وجود ندارد. فرد
بله درز
چه کسی گفت که این چیزها با ارزش بودند ، شما بودید. فرد
بله ، من انجام دادم درز
او این کار را کرد. با من اشکالی ندارد که او این کار را کرد. اما او پاپ و پاپ نیست
این را نمی گویم او این را گفت. تنها مشکلی که در آن وجود دارد این است که اگر او به آن اعتقاد داشته باشد ، اگر او اعتقاد داشته باشد
این درست است اگر او معتقد است که او این حرف را زده است و این بازی است که او بازی می کند ، فوق العاده است. شما هیچ ارزشی ندارید شما هیچ چیز نیستید هیچ چیز و گلوله ای. بدون ارزش و شما یک
دهان و می توانید بگویید ، "من این بیست و شش پروژه ، بیست و شش تعهد ، و
انجام آنها به من ارزش می دهد ، زیرا من چنین گفتم. " بگذارید یک سوال از شما بپرسم
در یک سوراخ در یک انتهای یک فیله با ارزش تر از یک توپ در بالای چوب کوچک در طرف دیگر
پایان فیله؟ شرایط با ارزش تر کدام است؟ یک توپ در یک سوراخ؟ یا یک توپ روی چوب؟ بسیاری از مردم فکر می کنند که خدا گفت که توپ در سوراخ ها بهتر از توپ های روی چوب است. آنها هستند
گلف بازان نامیده می شود. آنها فکر می کنند که اینگونه است ، و نه اینکه کسی آن را درست کند ... اگر فراموش کنید
276
وجود
که شما چنین می گویید ، به جای سرگرمی ، در مورد آن مغذی می شوید. بنابراین ، بله ، بیست و شش چیز شما:
فوق العاده تا زمانی که متعلق به شما باشد. فرد
من فقط این فکر را داشتم که اینجا ایستاده بود ، که اگر خیلی چیزها در جریان باشد ، می توانم از آن جلوگیری کنم
تسلط از آنجا که همیشه می توانم بگویم "من خیلی شلوغ هستم. من این جلسه را دارم که به آنجا بروم تا نتوانم بروم
به این جلسه دیگر. "
درز
بسیاری از افراد بیش از حد مشغول انجام هر کاری هستند. چه کسی در اینجا بیش از حد مشغول انجام هر کاری است؟ "من نمی رسم
هر کاری را انجام دهید زیرا من خیلی شلوغ هستم. "
فرد
من بیست و شش مورد را رها کردم و دیدم که هیچ رضایت از آنها وجود ندارد. من به سمت آنها رانده ام ،
و هیچ حس توانمندسازی وجود ندارد. بنابراین من واقعاً به تعجب نارضایتی می پردازم. که ممکن است رفتن به خانه و تماشای تلویزیون ، یک آبجو و فراموش کردن من بسیار شگفت انگیز باشد
بیست و شش مورد. ممکن است اصالت بیشتری در آرامش داشته باشد ، تماشای تلویزیون با آبجو از
پس از بیست و شش مورد من تقلا. درز
بله ، و هیچکدام از آنها نمی خواهند شما را در هر مکانی بدست آورند. (مکث)
و شما واقعاً می خواهید کاری را انجام دهید که به هر حال انجام می دهید ، نه آنچه فکر می کنید
انجام شما انتخاب زیادی در مورد آن ندارید. در واقع ، هیچ. شما فقط می توانید کاری را که انجام می دهید انجام دهید. شما
نمی توانید کاری را انجام دهید که انجام نمی دهید. به محض اینکه من کسی را که کاری را که انجام نداده است انجام داده ام ، ما هستیم
رفتن به انجام انجمن به دلیل اینکه گلوله ای خواهد بود. تا کنون ، با نگاهی به نیم میلیون
مردم ، ما کسی را پیدا نکرده ایم که آنچه را که انجام نداده است انجام داده است. همه فقط آنچه را انجام داده اند
آنها انجام دادند (به یک شرکت کننده دیگر که نشسته است)
آن را دریافت کنید؟ شما تا به حال کاری انجام داده اید که انجام نداده اید؟ شما فقط کاری را انجام می دهید ، درست است؟ شرکت کننده
من کاری را انجام می دهم که می خواهم انجام دهم. درز
شما کاری را که می خواهید انجام دهید انجام می دهید؟ شرکت کننده
همیشه درز
همیشه؟ erhard (ادامه)
روز اول انجمن: جلسه چهارم
277
(به یک شرکت کننده دیگر که در کنار شرکت کننده نشسته است که گفت آنچه را که می خواهد انجام دهد انجام می دهد)
روی دامان او بنشینید ، یا بازوهای او را پایین بیاورید. (شرکت کننده دیگر در دامان اول شرکت کننده قرار دارد)
اکنون: می خواهید بایستید. (شرکت کننده نمی تواند بایستد)
بنابراین ، شما همیشه کاری را که می خواهید انجام دهید انجام نمی دهید. و شما کاری را که دوست دارید انجام دهید انجام نمی دهید. شما چه کاری انجام می دهید
شما انجام می دهید این تمام کاری است که شما همیشه انجام می دهید. شما همیشه کاری را که انجام داده اید انجام داده اید ، و گاهی اوقات به طور تصادفی ،
هر از گاهی اتفاق می افتد همان کاری است که شما می خواهید انجام دهید. شرکت کننده
این مزخرف است درز
مزخرف است. شرکت کننده
پس چرا انجمن؟ درز
این همان چیزی است که من گفتم ما به محض اینکه کسی را که این کار را انجام داد ، می خواهیم جلوی این انجمن را بگیریم
کاری که انجام ندادند یک شرکت کننده به نام کوین ایستاد ، که در جریان مکالمه ارهارد با یعقوب در گذشته
جلسه ، شکایت کرده بود که دوربین با اشاره به یعقوب نیز به افراد "NO- اشاره می کند
بخش ویدیو "کوین
من به انجمن بسیار تردید آمدم. احساس من این بود که احتمالاً
چیزی از آن بیرون بیاورید. من مطمئن بودم که باید آنقدر گلوله ای را پشت سر بگذارم که نبودم
مطمئناً قصد داشتم آن را دوام بزنم. همانطور که معلوم شد که تا حدی درست بود ، زیرا من ، مثل یک دسته از
احساس می کنم افراد دیگر احساس می کنم در هر فرصتی جلسه بعدی را فروخته می شود. اما در
این نکته در بازی من مایل هستم که آن را نیز بپذیرم. آنقدر بد نبود که فکر می کردم می رود
بودن من واقعاً تا دیروز شروع به ورود به این کار نکردم ، یا شاید امروز بود. در جستجوی
راکت من ، من به نظر نمی رسد که راکت خود را از بین ببرد. اما در طول اشتراک ، این احساس را داشتم
هر فردی که ایستاده بود ، به نظر می رسید راکت همه راکت من است. من نمی توانستم باور کنم امروز حدس می زنم که یک موفقیت را کسب کرده ام. وهمی
نگه داشتن من می خواهم این مطالب را در مورد "من حدس می زنم که یک پیشرفت موفقیت آمیز داشته ام" تکمیل کنم. منظورم حتی نیست
قسمت "حدس". کجا می خواهید یک موفقیت را اعلام کنید؟ دستیابی به موفقیت کجا
رخ می دهد؟
