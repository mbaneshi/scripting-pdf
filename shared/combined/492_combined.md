SPEAKING BEING
There’s no such thing as action, there’s only action-in-the-world; “world” as an occurring and
“action” are correlates of one another. That ball looked uncatchable to you. That’s how the ball
looks to somebody called “clumsy.” It looks uncatchable, and their actions are those of anybody
else, athletic or not, their actions are the same, because the actions are not a product of a
property inside one’s self called “athletic.” People’s actions are a correlate of the way the world
occurs for them. Anybody didn’t get that?
JERRY
I didn’t get it.
ERHARD
What didn’t you get? Did you get that we are talking about the source of action?
JERRY
I heard it.
ERHARD
There’s a diff erence between hearing and getting. Did you get that we’re talking about the
source of action? Is that clear to you?
JERRY
Yes.
ERHARD
So what didn’t you get? “I didn’t get...”
JERRY
I didn’t get that it’s the same thing when you throw the ball over there to him as when you
throw it to her and she doesn’t catch it.
ERHARD
That’s good. That’s clear. Now we can have a forwarding discussion. So, his actions down here
are correlated to an uncatchable ball, yes?
JERRY
Correlated to me means “goes along with.”
ERHARD
That’s close enough for the moment, yes. His actions are consistent with—go along
with—an uncatchable ball, yes?
JERRY
Yes.
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day Four: Session Three 479
ERHARD
Now, you think that the ball is uncatchable or isn’t uncatchable. I’m telling you that his
actions are not correlated to an “is uncatchable.” His actions are correlated with an “occurs as
uncatchable.” Occurs. You get the diff erence?
JERRY
I get the second, what was the fi rst...?
ERHARD (throwing the ball to a participant in another part of the room from Jerry)
Let me ask you something: Was that ball uncatchable for you?
JERRY
Yes.
ERHARD
No, because there’s a possibility of your catching the ball.
(throwing the ball the same way again)
Catch that ball. What happened?
JERRY
I didn’t catch it.
ERHARD
Because it occurred as uncatchable for you.
JERRY
Right.
ERHARD
Is that clear for you?
JERRY
Yes.
ERHARD
And if I’m a certain way, and the ball goes like  that,
(throwing the ball again)
the ball occurs as uncatchable for me. If I threw the ball and it occurred as uncatchable for you,
you wouldn’t have put your hand up like that, you would have acted “clumsy.” So your actions,
and her actions, and my actions, and his actions are all a correlate of the ball as an occurring,
not the ball as an is. That ball is going a certain rate of speed and it is within a certain number
of inches from your body.
Event Ontology
To begin, try this: imagine that the phenomena in the world
around you—people, trees, dogs, the sky—do not merely exist, but
are at every moment coming into existence. Imagine that when you
look at a tree, you aren’t observing a thing that is just there, but
an event. The tree is occurring. Instead of just a tree, like a thing,
you are in the presence of a happening: treeing. The happening is
ongoing, as the tree withdraws from the world and emerges—its
emergence and withdrawal so correlated in time that they are
perceived only as a quality of aliveness. You sense the withdrawal,

SPEAKING BEING
JERRY
I hear you. I’m worried that I’m missing what “is” means.
ERHARD.
Good. Listen up. You told me what you didn’t get. We would say, you and I, because of the way
you and I are, that the ball is going at a certain speed, and it is arriving at a certain proximity to
your body at a certain place. So we would say it is catchable depending on how fast it’s going
and on how far it was when it started coming at you...
JERRY
I have a problem concentrating on what you’re saying. I’m sorry. It’s like you’re talking too fast
or I’m thinking too slow.
ERHARD
I understand: We’re talking in a place where you have your foot nailed to the fl oor. It’s all right.
You’re doing great. Just tell me to slow down.
JERRY
Thank you. Please slow down.
ERHARD
We’re contrasting an “is” ball and an “occurring” ball.
JERRY
I understand an occurring ball, I don’t understand an “is” ball.
ERHARD
The ball is going at a certain speed, yes? And the ball is in your range of vision for a certain
amount of time.
JERRY
Okay.
ERHARD
That’s what is, you and I would say. It is going at a certain speed. And it is in your range of
vision for a certain amount of time. And you and I would say if it is going in this envelope of
speed—not faster than this, but in this envelope of speed—and if you have that much time to
watch the ball going at that speed, the ball is catchable.
JERRY
Right. I got it.
ERHARD
So that’s an is catchable ball. But you and I do not act on “is ball”; you and I act on “occur ball.” It
doesn’t make any diff erence how fast the ball is going. Your actions are correlated to how fast the ball
and the absence, as a persisting background that contextualizes
your experience of the presence. In the presence of something,
you sense the possibility of nothing.
Heidegger scholar Susan Schoenbaum has proposed an
interesting analogy as a clue to this world of emergence and
withdrawal: the way the diff erentiation between foreground and
background occurs for us in our visual consciousness:
In this diff erentiation, the background is deter-
mined as receding into indetermination as the
foreground becomes more or less determinate.
The phenomenal movement of foregrounding
and backgrounding, the coming to be back-
ground and the coming to be determinate fore-
ground, all occur simultaneously. This complex
movement of determination is originary in the
sense that it makes simultaneously possible
(a) the determination of background (however
indeterminate) as background and foreground
as foreground, (b) the consequent appearing
of determinate beings that appear (in the
foreground), and (c) the coming into being of
the entire constellation as context or world,
including background, foreground, and the
determinate movements of diff erentiation. All
these aspects belong to an originary event of
diff erentiation of background and foreground.
(A Companion to Heidegger’s Introduction to
Metaphysics, 149–150, emphasis added)
“
In other words, there is much going on in our perception of the
world that happens below the level of awareness even as it shapes
that awareness.
Imagine now that this is the nature of reality: that we live
in a world of be-ings, rather than merely beings, a world that is
renewing itself in each instant. And imagine further that you, as a
being in that world, are likewise emerging newly in every moment.
Imagine that “you” are not a fixed phenomenon, but that, like
the tree, you occur, for yourself and for others, and withdraw, and
occur, a new being in each occurrence. Imagine that a human
Forum Day Four: Session Three 481
occurs as going. See you and I think that the guy who hits the ball over the net in tennis all the time
has skill. No. That’s a guy for whom the ball comes over the net very slowly and very big. That’s the
diff erence between him and me. He does not have some property inside himself that I don’t have.
JERRY
So you’re using “occurs” as the way the ball is perceived? The way the ball is seen or perceived?
ERHARD
Yeah, I don’t like that and it’ll get you into trouble if you push it too far, but yes, that’s a correct
understanding. It’s not mere perception. It’s not mere seeing. It’s an ontological phenomenon,
not a physiological phenomenon. It’s the way the ball occurs. So here’s what I’ve said so far.
Your actions are not a correlate of “is.” Your actions and her actions and my actions and his
actions are all perfectly correlated to the occurring ball. And why some people look clumsy to
us is because we don’t realize their actions are correlated to the occurring ball; we think their
actions are correlated with the is ball. It is going a certain speed. It is in their sights for a certain
amount of time.
JERRY (laughing)
This sounds pretty simple to me now.
ERHARD
Yeah, it is.
JERRY
Everybody else have that?
ERHARD
Yeah, they got it listening to you.
JERRY
I guess my problem was I didn’t know what you meant by occurring and what you meant by is.
ERHARD
You and I don’t dwell in the distinction called “occurring.” You and I dwell in the distinction
called “is.”
JERRY
Why not?
ERHARD
A thing called stupidity.
JERRY
Kids dwell in occurring, don’t they?
being is an event—an event with language, and therefore very
diff erent from trees, but nevertheless a happening, like all of the
other beings in the world, where absence is always the background
accompaniment to presence. Nonexistence is the background for
your existence.
According to Heidegger scholar Charles Guignon, such a
world is what Heidegger was aiming to retrieve for human beings.
Guignon calls it an event ontology, an alternative to the substance
ontology that has dominated Western thinking, in which the world
is just a collection of things. Such a world of events may sound
tenuous and risky; but consider: might you, reborn anew in every
moment of now, be more alive to existence? Might such a world be
more vivid, more challenging, more engaging? Might living in that
world keep you on your toes, or on the edge of your seat?
Heidegger proposes that the reality we have imagined here
was what the world was like for the early Greeks. This is also the
nature of the transformation that occurs in The Forum, where
participants get Nothing as a liberating context for their lives. ■
482
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
They dwell in “is” too. Nobody coaches occurring. They coach is. They tell you how to hold the
racket.
JERRY
How about the guy who wrote the book Inner Tennis. He coaches occurring, right?
ERHARD (walking toward Jerry and then standing right in front of him)
He doesn’t talk about it that way, but he does “occurring.” What makes Tim Gallwey’s coaching
eff ective—Tim coaches a shift in the occurring; he’s not trying to change the behavior. No
matter how much I know how to behave, I’m going to behave as a correlate of the occurring.
I’m not going to behave like I know how to behave. That’s true about you because you didn’t
always behave the way your mother told you to behave. By the time I was fi ve years old, my
mother told me everything I needed to know about how to be a decent human being. I had all
the knowledge I needed. Didn’t make a damn bit of diff erence. I was a rat. You too. You tell
yourself what to do, but you don’t do it, do you?
JERRY
Sometimes.
ERHARD
Yeah. Sometimes. But you always, your actions are always correlated with the occurring of
the world. That dictionary fl ies through the air, your hands will move in a dance with that
dictionary, because your hands are correlated with the occurring of the world.
JERRY
Yeah, I believe that, but it sounds like I missed something.
ERHARD
Don’t believe. I want you to get it.
JERRY
Well it feels like I’m missing something, because you’re saying it like it’s a big deal.
ERHARD
Yeah, it is a big deal. I’ll tell you what the big deal about it is: Stop trying to change
yourself. Stop trying to put properties inside of yourself. Stop trying to get yourself to do
the right thing. Alter the way the world occurs for you, and your actions will naturally
alter. You get that?
JERRY
Yeah, I believe I get it.
Forum Day Four: Session Three 483
ERHARD
Good. It’s simple. I understand. Took you a long time to get that simplicity, yes? Anything is
simple. It just takes a long time because we’ve got to get all the garbage out of the way. You
didn’t get what I said even when you felt that you got what I said.
JERRY
I felt I wasn’t listening. I had the problem that I didn’t hear what you said. I wasn’t listening.
ERHARD
I understand. You didn’t hear me because you were listening to your barriers to hearing what I
was saying. And the barriers to hearing what I was saying were provoked by what I was saying.
We’ve been doing that for four days here. We say stuff  that we don’t expect you to get. We say
stuff  designed to drive the barriers up in front of your face. Then we keep dealing with the
barriers. Then you start to drop the barriers. Then all of a sudden it’s empty and meaningless,
and then it’s like “well, obviously it’s empty and meaningless. Why didn’t you just say that in
the beginning?”
(laughter)
Clear? Give me my ball back. Thanks.
(applause)
Let me say it all over again. Here’s what I want you to get out of this. Your actions are not the
actions you want, or the actions you decide. They’re not a product of your past; your actions
are a correlate of the world as an occurring, not the world as an is world, but the world as an
occurring world. Your actions are perfectly correlated to the way the world occurs for you. If
the world occurred for you like it occurs for the person you most despise, you would act like
the person you most despise. No shit. Really. I know you think you’ve got goodness and all
that bullshit inside you. Go to the doctor and have him open you up so you can see. Cut that
noise out. Your actions are a correlate of the world as an occurring. You want me to throw the
dictionary a couple more times so you can see? Now the question is, “Well, what generates this
occurring?” We’re going to get to that, but not until you get... see you’re almost as stupid as you
were when you came in here, because you’re sitting out there trying to decide whether you
agree with this or not.
(laughter)
“Is that right? Do I agree with that? I practiced tennis for ten years, and that practice really
made me a good player. And I remember learning buh buh buh, and that made me better at
that.” Wrong! The practice and the learning alters the occurring. Staying in the conversation
Jerry and I were having: you know, you train an athlete. Most people train athletes like they’re
grooving in behavior, so you do it repetitively, that’s what training is, right? Repetition. So you
do it over and over and over again so you can do it automatically. Horseshit. Anything you do
automatically lacks skill, lacks power. You wouldn’t want an athlete who acted automatically.
You want an athlete free to act with the world he or she has to act within. What happens is,
Your actions are not the actions you want, or
the actions you decide. They’re not a product
of your past; your actions are a correlate of the
world as an occurring, not the world as an is
world, but the world as an occurring world.
“
484
SPEAKING BEING
you take behavior out when you train an athlete with repetition. You take behavior out, not add
behavior. He has to do this. You don’t want him to do that. Let him keep doing that and he’ll
stop doing that if the training’s any good, and he’ll be free to do anything. When he’s free to do
anything, he’ll deal with the ball eff ectively. You don’t need to tell people “step back when the
ball bounces in front of you.” Because you’re never going to be eff ective when you’re trying to
remember what to do when the ball bounces in front of you. When the ball bounces in front
of you as catchable, you step back, because stepping back is perfectly correlated with the ball
that bounces in front of you and is catchable. Stepping forward is what you do when the ball
bounces in front of you and it’s not catchable.
(pausing)
Is it starting to get through? Not “do you agree with it?”: Are you able to stand in the possibility
that my actions in life are not a product of internal properties? My actions in life aren’t a product
of anything. My actions in life are a correlate of something. What they are a correlate of is the
world as an occurring. For example, if the world occurs as threatening, your actions will be
perfectly correlated with a threatening world. The question is not: “Is the world threatening?”
The question is: “Does the world occur as threatening?” It’s not that one person is strong and
the other person weak. You think you’re strong, let me put you in a set of circumstances that
occur suffi  ciently threatening and you will cower. People who cower are not weaklings. The
world occurs for them as overwhelmingly threatening. People who are musical: Music occurs
for them in a way that it doesn’t for those of us who are not very musical. The keyboard does
not look like it does to you and me to a pianist. Totally diff erent. I did an experiment driving a
racecar for a year. Didn’t know anything about racing cars when I started. Didn’t even drive for
the most part when I started. I had a license. I hadn’t been in a gas station for something like ten
years. When I started out, the car went very fast. Really fast! I mean overwhelmingly fast. Except
for the guy on the sidelines who had the stopwatch. For him it was going very slow. But the
slower the car went for me, the faster my times were. I could see divots in the roadway a quarter
of an inch deep and put the edge of my tire in that divot. The car got real slow. Real easy to
drive a car slowly. You get into a race car and drive it slowly, it’s easy. Takes no talent, no ability,
which was very good in my case. The slower the car goes the faster the times are, because action
is a correlate of the occurring. How many people in here manage other people?
(several participants raising their hands)
How many other people in the room raise children? That’s managing people, by the way.
(more raising their hands)
Good. Put your hands down. You want to know why your kids act like they do? Because
the world occurs for them in such a way that their actions are a perfect correlate. They do
not do what you tell them to do. No shit. And if you think they’re doing what you tell them
to do, you’re wrong. Their actions are a correlate of the way the world occurs for them.
People murder not because they are bad people. Nobody has ever found bad inside anybody.
People murder because murder is a perfect correlate to a certain kind of occurring. The
law recognizes that by recognizing self-defense. Never mind how they explain it. Ellen is
not clumsy. Her actions are perfectly correlated with the way objects occur for her. She’s
Technology
So long as we do not, through thinking, experi-
ence what is, we can never belong to what will
be. (Martin Heidegger, “TT” in QCT 49)

وجود
هیچ کاری به عنوان عمل وجود ندارد ، فقط در جهان عمل می کند. "جهان" به عنوان یک اتفاق در حال وقوع و
"عمل" همبستگی یکدیگر است. آن توپ برای شما غیرقابل کنترل به نظر می رسید. این چگونه توپ است
به نظر می رسد کسی به نام "دست و پا چلفتی" است. به نظر می رسد غیرقابل تحقق است ، و اقدامات آنها از هر کسی است
در غیر این صورت ، ورزش یا نه ، اقدامات آنها یکسان است ، زیرا اقدامات محصول یک نیست
املاک موجود در درون خود "ورزشکار" است. اقدامات مردم ارتباطی با نحوه جهان است
برای آنها رخ می دهد. کسی این کار را نکرد؟ جری
من آن را دریافت نکردم درز
چه چیزی به دست نیاوردید؟ آیا دریافتید که ما در مورد منبع عمل صحبت می کنیم؟ جری
من آن را شنیدم درز
بین شنوایی و گرفتن تفاوت وجود دارد. آیا شما دریافتید که ما در مورد
منبع عمل؟ آیا این برای شما روشن است؟ جری
بله درز
پس چه چیزی به دست نیاوردید؟ "من دریافت نکردم ..."
جری
من دریافت نکردم که وقتی توپ را به آنجا می اندازید مانند وقتی که شما توپ را به آنجا می اندازید
آن را به سمت او پرتاب کنید و او آن را نمی گیرد. درز
خوب است واضح است اکنون می توانیم یک بحث حمل و نقل داشته باشیم. بنابراین ، اقدامات او در اینجا
آیا با یک توپ غیر قابل قبول ارتباط دارد ، بله؟ جری
همبستگی با من به معنای "همراه با آن" است.
درز
این برای لحظه به اندازه کافی نزدیک است ، بله. اقدامات او با همراهی همراه است
با - یک توپ غیرقابل کنترل ، بله؟ جری
بله erhard (ادامه)
روز چهارم انجمن: جلسه سه 479
درز
اکنون ، شما فکر می کنید که توپ غیرقابل کنترل است یا غیرقابل تحمل نیست. من به شما می گویم که او
اقدامات با "غیرقابل تحمل" همبستگی ندارند. اقدامات او با "اتفاق می افتد
غیرقابل تحمل. " اتفاق می افتد
من دوم را می گیرم ، اولین بار چه بود ...؟ Erhard (پرتاب توپ به یک شرکت کننده در قسمت دیگری از اتاق از جری)
بگذارید از شما چیزی بپرسم: آیا آن توپ برای شما غیرقابل کنترل بود؟ جری
بله درز
نه ، زیرا احتمال جذب توپ شما وجود دارد. (پرتاب توپ به همان روش)
آن توپ را بگیرید. چه اتفاقی افتاد؟ جری
من آن را نگرفتم. درز
زیرا این اتفاق برای شما غیر قابل قبول رخ داده است. جری
درست درز
آیا این برای شما روشن است؟ جری
بله درز
و اگر من یک روش خاص هستم ، و توپ به این صورت پیش می رود ،
(پرتاب دوباره توپ)
توپ برای من غیرقابل کنترل است. اگر من توپ را پرتاب کردم و برای شما غیرقابل کنترل بود ،
شما نمی خواهید دست خود را به این شکل قرار دهید ، "دست و پا چلفتی" عمل می کردید. بنابراین اقدامات شما ،
و اقدامات او ، و اقدامات من ، و اعمال او همه ارتباط توپ به عنوان یک اتفاق است ،
نه توپ به عنوان یک است. آن توپ سرعت مشخصی را طی می کند و در تعداد مشخصی قرار دارد
از اینچ از بدن شما. اثر شناسی وقایع
برای شروع ، این را امتحان کنید: تصور کنید که پدیده های جهان
در اطراف شما - مردم ، درختان ، سگ ها ، آسمان - صرفاً وجود ندارد ، بلکه
در هر لحظه به وجود می آیند. تصور کنید که وقتی شما هستید
به یک درخت نگاه کنید ، شما چیزی را مشاهده نمی کنید که فقط در آنجاست ، اما
یک رویداد درخت در حال وقوع است. به جای فقط یک درخت ، مانند یک چیز ،
شما در حضور یک اتفاق هستید: درختی. اتفاق است
در حال انجام ، همانطور که درخت از جهان خارج می شود و ظهور می کند -
ظهور و عقب نشینی چنان در زمان همبسته است که آنها هستند
فقط به عنوان کیفیت زنده بودن درک می شود. شما احساس عقب نشینی می کنید ،

وجود
جری
من شما را می شنوم من نگران این هستم که معنای "" را از دست بدهم. erhard خوب گوش کن شما به من گفتید که چه چیزی دریافت نکردید. ما به خاطر راه می گفتیم ، من و شما
من و شما هستیم که توپ با سرعت مشخصی پیش می رود و به مجاورت خاصی می رسد
بدن شما در یک مکان خاص. بنابراین ما می گوییم بسته به سرعت آن قابل قبول است
و در مورد اینکه وقتی شروع به آمدن به شما کرد تا کجا بود ... جری
من با تمرکز روی آنچه شما می گویید مشکل دارم. متاسفم مثل این است که خیلی سریع صحبت می کنید
یا من خیلی کند فکر می کنم درز
من می فهمم: ما در مکانی صحبت می کنیم که پای خود را به سمت کف می زنید. خوب است شما عالی کار می کنید فقط به من بگویید که کند شوید. جری
ممنون لطفا سرعت خود را کاهش دهید. درز
ما در مقابل توپ "is" و یک توپ "اتفاق" قرار داریم. جری
من یک توپ موجود را درک می کنم ، یک توپ "IS" را نمی فهمم. درز
توپ با سرعت مشخص می رود ، بله؟ و توپ در محدوده دید شما برای یک خاص است
مقدار زمان جری
خوب درز
این همان چیزی است که من و شما می گوییم. با سرعت خاصی پیش می رود. و در محدوده شماست
چشم انداز برای مدت مشخصی. و من و شما می گفتیم اگر در این پاکت می رود
سرعت - سریعتر از این نیست ، اما در این پاکت سرعت - و اگر زمان زیادی برای آن دارید
توپ را با این سرعت تماشا کنید ، توپ قابل جذب است. جری
درست من آن را دریافت کردم درز
بنابراین این یک توپ قابل قبول است. اما من و شما روی "توپ" عمل نمی کنیم. من و شما روی "BECE BALL" عمل می کنیم. من
هیچ مشکلی ایجاد نمی کند که توپ چقدر سریع پیش می رود. اقدامات شما با سرعت توپ ارتباط دارد
و غیبت ، به عنوان یک پیش زمینه مداوم که متناسب است
تجربه شما از حضور. در حضور چیزی ،
شما احتمال هیچ چیز را حس می کنید. محقق هایدگر سوزان شونباوم پیشنهاد کرده است
قیاس جالب به عنوان سرنخ این دنیای ظهور و
عقب نشینی: نحوه تفاوت بین پیش زمینه و
پیش زمینه برای ما در آگاهی بصری ما رخ می دهد:
در این تفاوت ، پس زمینه بازدارنده است
استخراج شده به عنوان نامشخص به عنوان
پیش زمینه کم و بیش تعیین می شود. حرکت پدیده پیش زمینه
و پس زمینه ، بازگشت به عقب-
زمین و آمدن تعیین کننده
زمین ، همه به طور همزمان اتفاق می افتد. این مجموعه
حرکت تعیین در اصل است
احساس کنید که همزمان امکان پذیر است
(الف) تعیین پیشینه (با این حال
نامشخص) به عنوان زمینه و پیش زمینه
به عنوان پیش زمینه ، (ب) در نتیجه ظاهر می شود
موجودات تعیین کننده ای که ظاهر می شوند (در
پیش زمینه) ، و (ج) ورود به
کل صورت فلکی به عنوان زمینه یا جهان ،
از جمله زمینه ، پیش زمینه ، و
حرکات تعیین کننده متفاوت. همه
این جنبه ها متعلق به یک رویداد اصلی است
متفاوت بودن پس زمینه و پیش زمینه. (همراهی با معرفی هایدگر در
متافیزیک ، 149-150 ، تأکید اضافه شده)
"
به عبارت دیگر ، در درک ما از
دنیایی که زیر سطح آگاهی اتفاق می افتد حتی در حالی که شکل می گیرد
آن آگاهی اکنون تصور کنید که این ماهیت واقعیت است: ما زندگی می کنیم
در دنیای be-ings ، نه صرفاً موجودات ، دنیایی که هست
در هر لحظه خود را تجدید می کند. و بیشتر تصور کنید که شما ، به عنوان
بودن در آن جهان ، به همین ترتیب در هر لحظه نیز ظاهر می شود. تصور کنید که "شما" یک پدیده ثابت نیستید ، اما مانند آن ،
درخت ، شما اتفاق می افتد ، برای خود و دیگران ، و عقب نشینی ، و
اتفاق جدید در هر مورد رخ می دهد. تصور کنید که یک انسان
روز چهارم انجمن: جلسه سه 481
اتفاق می افتد شما را می بینم و فکر می کنم آن مرد که تمام وقت توپ را در تنیس به توپ می زند
مهارت دارد نه. این یک پسر است که توپ برای آن خیلی آهسته و بسیار بزرگ به تور می رسد. این
تفاوت بین او و من. او در درون خودش دارایی ندارد که من ندارم. جری
بنابراین شما از "اتفاق" به عنوان نحوه درک توپ استفاده می کنید؟ راهی که توپ دیده می شود یا درک می شود؟ درز
بله ، من آن را دوست ندارم و اگر خیلی فشار بیاورید ، شما را دچار مشکل می کند ، اما بله ، این یک صحیح است
درک این درک صرف نیست این فقط دیدن نیست این یک پدیده هستی شناختی است ،
یک پدیده فیزیولوژیکی نیست. این راهی است که توپ رخ می دهد. بنابراین این همان چیزی است که من تاکنون گفتم. اقدامات شما همبستگی "IS" نیست. اقدامات شما و اعمال او و اعمال من و او
اقدامات کاملاً با توپ اتفاق می افتد. و چرا برخی از افراد دست و پا چلفتی به نظر می رسند
ما به این دلیل است که ما نمی دانیم که اقدامات آنها با توپ اتفاق می افتد. ما فکر می کنیم آنها
اقدامات با توپ IS در ارتباط است. این یک سرعت خاص است. این در دیدگاه های آنها برای خاص است
مقدار زمان جری (خنده)
این برای من اکنون بسیار ساده به نظر می رسد. درز
بله ، این است جری
همه افراد دیگر آن را دارند؟ درز
بله ، آنها آن را به گوش شما گوش دادند. جری
من حدس می زنم مشکل من این بود که من نمی دانستم منظور شما از وقوع و منظور شما چیست. درز
من و شما در تمایز به نام "اتفاق" ساکن نیستیم. من و شما در تمایز زندگی می کنیم
"IS" نامیده می شود.
جری
چرا نه؟ درز
چیزی به نام حماقت. جری
بچه ها در حال وقوع هستند ، مگر نه؟ بودن یک رویداد است - یک رویداد با زبان ، و بنابراین بسیار
متفاوت از درختان ، اما با این وجود یک اتفاق ، مانند همه
موجودات دیگر در جهان ، جایی که غیبت همیشه پس زمینه است
همراهی با حضور. عدم وجود پیش زمینه برای
وجود شما به گفته محقق هایدگر ، چارلز گیونون ، چنین
جهان همان چیزی است که هایدگر قصد داشت برای انسانها بازیابی شود. Guignon آن را یک هستی شناسی رویداد می نامد ، جایگزینی برای ماده
هستی شناسی که بر تفکر غربی حاکم شده است ، که در آن جهان
فقط مجموعه ای از چیزها است. چنین دنیایی از وقایع ممکن است به نظر برسد
پرتحرک و خطرناک ؛ اما در نظر بگیرید: ممکن است شما ، دوباره متولد شوید
لحظه ای از اکنون ، بیشتر از وجود زنده باشید؟ ممکن است چنین دنیایی باشد
واضح تر ، چالش برانگیزتر ، جذاب تر؟ ممکن است در آن زندگی کند
دنیا شما را روی انگشتان پا یا لبه صندلی خود نگه می دارد؟ هایدگر پیشنهاد می کند که واقعیتی که در اینجا تصور کرده ایم
همان چیزی بود که جهان برای یونانیان اولیه بود. این هم هست
ماهیت تحول که در انجمن رخ می دهد ، کجا
شرکت کنندگان چیزی به عنوان یک زمینه آزاد کننده برای زندگی خود دریافت نمی کنند. ■

چطور در مورد مردی که کتاب تنیس داخلی را نوشت. او مربیان اتفاق می افتد ، درست است؟ erhard (قدم زدن به سمت جری و سپس ایستادن درست در مقابل او)
او در مورد آن صحبت نمی کند ، اما "اتفاق می افتد". چه چیزی باعث مربیگری تیم گالوی می شود
مربیان مؤثر - در حال تغییر در اتفاقات است. او سعی در تغییر رفتار ندارد. هیچ
مهم است که من چقدر می دانم چگونه رفتار کنم ، من می خواهم به عنوان همبستگی اتفاقات رفتار کنم. من نمی خواهم رفتار کنم مثل اینکه می دانم چگونه رفتار کنم. این در مورد شما صادق است زیرا شما این کار را نکردید
همیشه به روشی که مادرتان به شما گفت رفتار کنید رفتار کنید. تا زمانی که من سالها بودم ، خودم
مادر به من گفت هر آنچه را که باید در مورد چگونگی داشتن یک انسان مناسب و معقول بدانم ، به من گفت. من همه داشتم
دانش مورد نیاز من تفاوت زیادی در مورد لعنتی ایجاد نکردید. من یک موش بودم. تو هم شما می گویید
خودتان چه کاری انجام دهید ، اما شما این کار را نمی کنید ، آیا؟ جری
گاهی اوقات. درز
بله گاهی اوقات. اما شما همیشه ، اقدامات شما همیشه با اتفاقات مرتبط است
جهان آن فرهنگ لغت از طریق هوا ، دستان شما در رقص با آن حرکت می کند
فرهنگ لغت ، زیرا دستان شما با وقوع جهان در ارتباط است. جری
بله ، من این را باور دارم ، اما به نظر می رسد که چیزی را از دست داده ام. درز
باور نکنید من می خواهم شما آن را دریافت کنید. جری
خوب احساس می کنم چیزی را از دست داده ام ، زیرا شما می گویید که این یک کار بزرگ است. درز
بله ، این یک کار بزرگ است من به شما می گویم که چه چیز بزرگی در مورد آن وجود دارد: تلاش برای تغییر را متوقف کنید
خودت دست از تلاش برای قرار دادن خواص در درون خود متوقف کنید. دست از تلاش خود برای انجام این کار بردارید
چیز درست نحوه وقوع جهان برای شما را تغییر دهید و اقدامات شما به طور طبیعی انجام خواهد شد
تغییر دهید. شما آن را دریافت می کنید؟ جری
بله ، من معتقدم که آن را دریافت می کنم. روز چهارم انجمن: جلسه سه 483
درز
خوب ساده است من می فهمم مدت زمان طولانی برای به دست آوردن این سادگی ، بله؟ هر چیزی است
ساده این فقط مدت زمان زیادی طول می کشد زیرا ما باید همه زباله ها را از راه دور کنیم. شما
آنچه را که من گفتم دریافت نکردم حتی وقتی احساس کردید که آنچه را که من گفتم دارید. جری
احساس کردم گوش نمی دهم. من این مشکل را داشتم که آنچه را که شما گفتید نشنیدم. من گوش نمی کردم درز
من می فهمم شما من را نشنیدید زیرا شما در حال گوش دادن به موانع خود برای شنیدن آنچه من بودید
می گفت و موانع شنیدن آنچه می گفتم توسط آنچه می گفتم برانگیخته شد. ما چهار روز در اینجا این کار را انجام داده ایم. ما چیزهایی را می گوییم که انتظار نداریم شما را بدست آورید. ما می گوییم
چیزهایی که برای هدایت موانع جلوی صورت شما طراحی شده اند. سپس ما همچنان با
موانع سپس شروع به رها کردن موانع می کنید. ناگهان خالی و بی معنی است ،
و پس از آن مانند "خوب ، بدیهی است که خالی و بی معنی است. چرا فقط این را نگفتید
آغاز؟ "
(خنده)
پاک کردن؟ توپم را به من برگردان ممنون (تشویق)
بگذارید دوباره آن را بگویم. این چیزی است که من می خواهم از این کار خارج شوید. اقدامات شما نیست
اقدامات مورد نظر شما یا اقداماتی که تصمیم می گیرید. آنها محصول گذشته شما نیستند. اقدامات شما
همبستگی جهان به عنوان یک اتفاق در حال وقوع است ، نه جهان به عنوان جهان است ، بلکه جهان به عنوان یک
دنیای رخ داده اقدامات شما کاملاً با نحوه وقوع جهان برای شما ارتباط دارد. اگر
دنیا برای شما اتفاق افتاده است مانند آن که برای شخصی که از آن بیشتر بیزار است اتفاق می افتد ، شما مانند آن رفتار می کنید
شخصی که بیشتر از آن بیزار است. بدون گه واقعاً من می دانم که شما فکر می کنید خوب و همه چیز دارید
آن مزخرف در درون شما. به پزشک مراجعه کنید و او را باز کنید تا ببینید. آن را قطع کنید
سر و صدا بیرون اقدامات شما همبستگی جهان به عنوان یک اتفاق است. شما می خواهید من را پرتاب کنم
فرهنگ لغت چند بار دیگر بنابراین می توانید ببینید؟ حال سوال این است ، "خوب ، چه چیزی این را ایجاد می کند
اتفاق می افتد؟ " ما می خواهیم به آن برسیم ، اما تا زمانی که نرسیدید ... ببینید که تقریباً به اندازه شما احمق هستید
وقتی به اینجا آمدید ، زیرا در آنجا نشسته اید و سعی می کنید تصمیم بگیرید که آیا شما
با این موافق یا نه (خنده)
"آیا این درست است؟ آیا من با آن موافقم؟ من ده سال تنیس را تمرین کردم ، و واقعاً آن عمل
من را به یک بازیکن خوب تبدیل کرد. و یادم است که یاد می گیرم Buh Buh Buh ، و این باعث بهتر شدن من شد
که. " اشتباه!
من و جری داشتیم: می دانید ، شما یک ورزشکار را آموزش می دهید. بیشتر افراد مانند آنها ورزشکاران را آموزش می دهند
با رفتار با رفتار ، بنابراین شما این کار را به صورت مکرر انجام می دهید ، این همان آموزش است ، درست است؟ تکرار بنابراین شما
بارها و بارها این کار را انجام دهید تا بتوانید آن را به صورت خودکار انجام دهید. نعل اسب هر کاری که می کنید
به طور خودکار فاقد مهارت است ، فاقد قدرت است. شما یک ورزشکار نمی خواهید که به طور خودکار عمل کند. شما می خواهید یک ورزشکار آزاد با دنیایی که باید در آن عمل کند ، عمل کند. آنچه اتفاق می افتد این است ،
اقدامات شما عملی نیست که شما می خواهید ، یا
اقداماتی که تصمیم می گیرید آنها محصولی نیستند
از گذشته شما اقدامات شما همبستگی با
جهان به عنوان یک اتفاق ، نه جهان به عنوان یک
جهان ، اما جهان به عنوان یک جهان در حال وقوع است. "

وجود
شما هنگام آموزش یک ورزشکار با تکرار رفتار می کنید. شما رفتار می کنید ، اضافه نکنید
رفتار او باید این کار را انجام دهد. شما نمی خواهید او این کار را انجام دهد. بگذارید او این کار را ادامه دهد و او خواهد بود
اگر این تمرین خوب است ، این کار را متوقف کنید ، و او در انجام هر کاری آزاد خواهد بود. وقتی او آزاد است
هر چیزی ، او با توپ به طرز چشمگیری برخورد خواهد کرد. لازم نیست به مردم بگویید "وقتی
توپ در مقابل شما است. " زیرا وقتی سعی می کنید هرگز مؤثر نخواهید بود
به یاد داشته باشید وقتی توپ در مقابل شما قرار می گیرد چه کاری باید انجام دهید. وقتی توپ در جلو می چرخد
از شما به عنوان قابل قبول ، قدم برمی دارید ، زیرا قدم به عقب کاملاً با توپ همبستگی دارد
که در مقابل شما پرش می شود و قابل قبول است. قدم به جلو همان کاری است که هنگام توپ انجام می دهید
در مقابل شما قرار دارد و قابل قبول نیست. (مکث)
آیا شروع به عبور از آن می شود؟ "آیا با آن موافقید؟": آیا می توانید در این امکان بایستید
اینکه اقدامات من در زندگی محصول خواص داخلی نیست؟ اقدامات من در زندگی محصولی نیست
از هر چیزی اقدامات من در زندگی ارتباط چیزی است. آنچه آنها ارتباط آنهاست
جهان به عنوان یک اتفاق. به عنوان مثال ، اگر جهان به عنوان تهدیدآمیز رخ دهد ، اقدامات شما خواهد بود
کاملاً با دنیای تهدیدآمیز ارتباط دارد. سوال این نیست: "آیا جهان تهدیدآمیز است؟"
سؤال این است: "آیا جهان به عنوان تهدیدآمیز اتفاق می افتد؟" این طور نیست که یک نفر قوی باشد و
شخص دیگر ضعیف است. شما فکر می کنید قوی هستید ، بگذارید شما را در مجموعه ای از شرایط قرار دهم
به شدت تهدیدآمیز است و شما می خواهید. افرادی که قدرت دارند ضعیف نیستند. در
جهان برای آنها به عنوان بسیار تهدیدآمیز رخ می دهد. افرادی که موسیقی هستند: موسیقی رخ می دهد
برای آنها به گونه ای که برای کسانی از ما که خیلی موسیقی نیستند ، نیست. صفحه کلید انجام می دهد
به نظر نمی رسد مانند من و شما به یک پیانیست. کاملاً متفاوت است. من یک آزمایش را انجام دادم
Racecar به مدت یک سال. وقتی شروع کردم چیزی در مورد اتومبیل های مسابقه نمی دانم. حتی رانندگی نکرد
بیشتر قسمتها وقتی شروع کردم. مجوز داشتم من برای چیزی مانند ده در پمپ بنزین نبودم
سالها وقتی شروع کردم ، ماشین خیلی سریع پیش رفت. واقعاً سریع! منظورم خیلی سریع است. جز
برای آن مرد در حاشیه ای که کرونومتر بود. برای او خیلی کند پیش می رفت. اما
کندتر ماشین برای من رفت ، هر چه روزه من بود. من می توانم یک چهارم در جاده ها ببینم
از یک اینچ عمیق و لبه تایر من را در آن بخش قرار دهید. ماشین واقعاً کند شد. واقعی آسان برای
به آرامی ماشین رانندگی کنید. شما وارد یک ماشین مسابقه می شوید و به آرامی رانندگی می کنید ، آسان است. هیچ استعدادی ندارد ، بدون توانایی ،
که در مورد من بسیار خوب بود. آهسته تر ماشین سریعتر می رود ، زیرا عمل
همبستگی رخ داده است. چند نفر در اینجا افراد دیگر را مدیریت می کنند؟ (چندین شرکت کننده دست خود را بالا می برند)
چند نفر دیگر در اتاق کودکان را پرورش می دهند؟ به هر حال این مدیریت مردم است. (بیشتر دست خود را بالا می برید)
خوب دستان خود را پایین بگذارید. شما می خواهید بدانید که چرا بچه های شما مانند آنها رفتار می کنند؟ چون
جهان برای آنها به گونه ای رخ می دهد که اقدامات آنها یک ارتباط کامل باشد. آنها انجام می دهند
کاری را که به آنها می گویید انجام ندهید. بدون گه و اگر فکر می کنید آنها آنچه را که به آنها می گویید انجام می دهند
برای انجام ، شما اشتباه می کنید. اقدامات آنها ارتباطی با نحوه وقوع جهان برای آنها است. مردم قتل نمی کنند زیرا آنها افراد بدی هستند. هیچ کس تا به حال در هیچ کس بدی پیدا نکرده است. قتل مردم به دلیل قتل یک ارتباط کامل با نوع خاصی از اتفاقات است. در
قانون این امر را با شناخت دفاع از خود تشخیص می دهد. هرگز به این نکته توجه نکنید که چگونه آنها آن را توضیح می دهند. الن است
دست و پا چلفتی نیست اقدامات او کاملاً با نحوه وقوع اشیاء برای او ارتباط دارد. او
فناوری
تا زمانی که ما از طریق تفکر ، تجربه نکنیم
آنچه هست ، ما هرگز نمی توانیم به آنچه می خواهیم تعلق داشته باشیم
