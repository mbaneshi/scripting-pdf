Forum Day Three: Session Three Interval 265
It may be helpful to consider the situation this way:
For the Pre-Socratic Greek thinkers, to whom a new level of world-awareness was
becoming accessible, pre-phenomena presented themselves in a state of “originary
unity”—an “overwhelming coming-to-presence that has not yet been surmounted
in thinking” (IM 67), an upheaval of entities and forces not yet held in language, their
M
boundaries uncertain, their natures and relationships not yet fully distinguished.
To use a phrase that is central in the work of both Erhard and Heidegger (a term
further discussed at the Session Two Interval), we might say that these pre-phenomena
lived as possibilities for Being. As undistinguished, however, they swam without
limits in the realm of possibility. The sway designates that realm, a realm of Being
which is not yet in-the-world but is on the verge. These pre-phenomena may also be
usefully understood as possible meanings, or not-yet-meanings, and the sway may
therefore be seen as a realm of meaninglessness (an experience of this realm—which
Heidegger refers to as the Nothing—will be seen to be a critical aspect of The Forum
transformation). The not-yet-meanings, presumably, might include both physical
and non-physical pre- phenomena that had not yet pressed forward to be named
and distinguished as possibilities—such as microbes, sexual abuse, gravity, ethnici-
ty, digital communication, homophobia, and egotism.
Heidegger has distinguished a mode of speaking he calls Saying, which has
the force of bringing forth, rather than merely re-presenting. “The essential being
of language,” he says, “is Saying as Showing” (OWL 123). This is languaging that
generates. In the speaking of the Greeks, which Heidegger calls originative Saying,
a world was brought forth.
Physis, then, is: Being brought forth by originative Saying to stand in the world;
as well as the beings brought forth and set into limits by the naming; as well as the
process by which beings and Being emerge. Physis is the “event of standing forth,
arising from the concealed and thus enabling the concealed to take its stand for the
first time” (IM 16).
All of this, as we have said, is essentially talk about something that cannot be
talked about, and here Heidegger scholar Susan Schoenbohm suggests the chal-
lenge we face in attempting to analyze this phenomenon:
“
How, if at all, is it possible to render in words that which “is”
previous to any being, word, or name? How to articulate the
very coming-into-being of determination for the first time? [. . .]
In its most originary meaning, physis means the emerging, for
the first time, of something out of no determination at all . . . in
other words, the process of something’s coming-to-be-something
from nothing. (A Companion to Heidegger’s Introduction to
Metaphysics. 148)
For the Pre-Socratics, not-yet-beings were becoming manifest as possibilities. The
task for humans was to bring them forth, from a background of meaninglessness, to
stand as beings in a world of meaning.
Emerging into the world as a possibility, a being enters a lighting “from which
whatever lingers awhile in presence can be appropriately collected and brought
forward by mortal legein,” by human naming (EGT 70). Naming
T
for the Pre-Socratics
was not merely providing a label; it was distinguishing a possibility of meaning, and
therefore of Being. Here, in a passage from the second day of The Forum, Erhard
describes the process:
“
Distinction is an operation in language. In the normal course
of events you and I think of language as something we use to
report on something. . . . But now we’re distinguishing a new
kind of operation in language. It’s an operation in language
called generating. It’s as though I said “chair” and a chair fell
out of my mouth. . . . What distinguishing is, is to take some-
thing like an undiff erentiated mass and to bring forth from
that mass a realm of possibility.y  Distinction gives existence.
It makes existence possible.
From the undiff erentiated mass of the sway, the Pre-Socratics were distinguishing
the possibilities of a world.
Heidegger describes the events of this time as a process of strife, “not war
in the human sense” but “strife that holds sway” (IM 67, emphasis added). The
Greeks were engaged in a struggle to bring physis—the turbulent sway, vacillating
in its persistent emergence and withdrawal—to stand in the world, by naming and
diff erentiating its elements as beings:
“
As Heraclitus thinks it, struggle first and foremost allows what
essentially unfolds to step apart from each other in opposition,
first allows position and status and rank to establish themselves
in coming to presence. In such a stepping apart, cleft s, intervals,
distances and joints open themselves up. In con-frontation,
world comes to be. [. . .] This breaking forth, breaking up, cap-
turing and subjugating is in itself the first opening of beings as
sea, as earth,
s
as animal. (

SPEAKING BEING
In Heidegger’s imagining of this process as he finds it in the fragments of the Pre-
Socratics, we find a saga of violent images and primal struggle, at “the dawn of
early times in the land of evening” (EGT 18). He is not aiming to provide a record
of events, since events of the time are necessarily shrouded in darkness. His tale,
he says, must therefore be less natural science than mythology (IM 173). He is
presenting an account of the forces that must have been at play as human beings,
and their world, emerged into a crucial evolutionary phase, and the thinkers of the
time struggled to engage that emergence. In Heidegger’s account, the engagement
is violent.
But where in the world are these violent events occurring? This is not, aft er all,
a saga of nations in battle, but a story of thinkers thinking; and certainly it was on
one level an intellectual event—a struggle of minds to engage and comprehend the
new, an “internal” process of perception and deliberation. But that process was at
the same time bringing forth a world into the world for the first time. This world was
not “out there,” waiting to be labeled; world arose (as it continues to arise) in its
apprehension by human Being-in-the-world. These primordial events, then, were
occurring at the wavering interface between looking and thinking and naming.
Further, in the process of naming, and thereby creating an order of rank and
place in a world of meaning, Heidegger says that the Greeks were leaving the realm
of mythology and entering history. They were the beings into whose evolutionary
path had emerged the gift  of language. Now they were recognizing the inescap-
able obligation of the gift : humans must unconceal beings and name them as the
beings they are, opening them to existence and providing that existence with limits.
This was the task of the Pre-Socratic thinkers, as well as the poets, statesmen, and
artisans through whose work Greek culture developed: “Against the overwhelming
sway, they throw the counterweight of their work and capture in this work the world
that is thereby opened up” (IM 68).
“
The temple, in its standing there, first gives to things their
look and to men their outlook on themselves. . . . It is the
same with the sculpture of the god, votive off ering of the
victor in the athletic games. It is not a portrait whose purpose
is to make it easier to realize how the god looks; rather, it is a
work that lets the god himself be present and thus is the god
himself. (“OWA” in PLT 43)
T
Indeed, Heidegger writes, the “nature of art, on which both the art work and the
artist depend, is the setting-itself-into-work of truth” (“OWA” in PLT 72). And in
responding to the demand of truth setting-itself-into-work, humanity was for
the first time “coming to itself”: “The selfhood of humanity means this: it has to
transform the Being that opens itself up to it into history, and thus bring itself to a
stand” (IM 160). And as the Greeks opened themselves into history, says Heidegger,
the question about their own Being underwent a change from “What is humanity?”
into the form “Who is humanity?” (IM 160).
Like many of the questions raised in Heidegger’s thinking, this one leaves us
thinking a precarious balance between human agency and evolutionary forces. At
this distance we cannot conceptualize the situation; Heidegger hints at its nature:
“
the violence-doing of poetic saying, of thoughtful projection,
of constructive building, of state-creating action, is not an
application of faculties that the human being has, but is a dis-
ciplining and disposing of the violent forces by virtue of which
beings disclose themselves as such, insofar as the human
being enters into them. This disclosedness of beings is the
violence that humanity has to conquer in order to be itself first
of all, that is, to be historical in doing violence in the midst of
beings. (IM 175)
M
But Heidegger challenges
“
the opinion human beings cherish of themselves as those who
have invented and who could have invented language and
understanding, building and poetry. How is humanity ever
supposed to have invented that . . . due to which humanity
itself can be as humanity in the first place? (IM 174)
M
The struggle meant here is originary struggle, for it allows
those that struggle to originate as such in the first place. . . .
(IM 68)

This situation creates an interesting chicken-or-egg challenge for thinking: How
did human beings create a world in language, when human beings themselves first
came to be human beings through language? The scholar Charles Guignon has pro-
vided this useful observation of the quandary:
