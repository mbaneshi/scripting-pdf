Forum Day Three: Session Three 241
WES
You’re doing whatever you’re doing, and you’re adding this story that it’s leading me toward
perfection. But it’s leading you toward a hole in the ground, and they’re going to throw you in
it, and they’re going to throw dirt in your face. Think about that.
JACOB
Yeah, yeah. That’s what happened.
WES
No, that’s what will happen.
JACOB
Yeah, when I get there that will be what happened. I don’t mind adding a story to my life, just
to make it interesting, or entertaining. I don’t mind tinting my life with fi ction. Just to make it
interesting.
ERHARD
You were doing fi ne until you added the “just to make it interesting.”
JACOB
Or entertaining.
ERHARD
Or “just to make it entertaining.” The story “in order to be entertained.” That’s terrible.
JACOB
Yeah, yeah.
ERHARD
The purpose to the story is the story.
JACOB
Yeah, yeah.
ERHARD
What’s more entertaining than a tree? Nothing. Standing in front of a tree: nothing can be
more entertaining than standing in front of a tree.
JACOB
So when you take what happened then there should be automatic meaning added to it without
having to play violins...
ERHARD
There’s no meaning to it. The tree doesn’t mean anything. It’s just a tree.
We have suggested that an essential relationship exists between the
experience evoked in the est Training and that made available in The
Forum; and we have said that neither experience is captured in the
spoken words of the conversations, but that both are communicated
in the unspoken context of those words. Heidegger likewise directs
us to consider the character of the context. If modern human beings
are to engage in a thoughtful dialogue with the writing of the pre-
Socratics—and Heidegger sees such a dialogue as critical for this
moment in history—then we must begin to apprehend in our thinking
“the unified totality of the manifold” (EGT 22).
Dialogue with early Greek thinking will be fruit-
ful only when such listening occurs. It is proper
to dialogue that its conversation speak of the
same thing; indeed that it speak out of partici-
pation in the Same. (EGT 22)
“
Over the vast chasm of time and language, can what we hear
be the same as what the Greek thinkers are saying? To develop
this question, Heidegger places a passage from the pre-Socratic
thinker Parmenides alongside one from the thinking of a modern
philosopher, Nietzsche, and makes this observation regarding the
juxtaposition:
The ancient fragment of early Western thinking
and the late fragment of recent Western think-
ing bring the Same to language, but what they
say is not identical. However, where we can
speak of the Same in terms of things which are
not identical, the fundamental condition of a
thoughtful dialogue between recent and early
times is automatically fulfilled. . . . [G]ranting
the diff erences between these epochs, we are
together with the early thinkers in the realm of
the Same. (EGT 23)

SPEAKING BEING
JACOB
Rather than meaning, there’s a plot to it.
ERHARD
There’s no plot to it. You add the plot. And you’re not doing it to entertain yourself. You’re doing
it because you’re doing it. You justify doing it in here when we get you to see that you’re doing it
by saying I’m doing it in order to entertain myself. But you’re not doing it. And you’re not doing
it to entertain yourself.
JACOB
But what if it does entertain me?
ERHAD
Then it does. But you don’t do it in order to entertain yourself.
JACOB
Yeah. You don’t do anything in order to anything.
ERHARD
Exactly. You do what you do and you don’t do what you don’t do. And you got all the
justifi cation that you add to that.
JACOB
I do what I like.
ERHARD
You don’t do what you like.
JACOB
That would be an in-order-to.
ERHARD
Right. Nobody ever does what they like. They do what they do. Have you ever done anything
you didn’t do?
JACOB
No.
ERHARD
Have you ever done anything you didn’t like to do?
JACOB
Yeah.
Thus we can say, in the sense that Heidegger is distinguishing
here, that the est Training and The Forum are the Same but not
identical. Further, we can likewise say that the Same relationship
exists between the “single thought” of Heidegger’s thinking and
the transformational experience evoked in The Forum.
Heidegger further teases out the distinction “the Same” in a
discussion of the Logos, the site where beings, emerging into
the world of meaning, are gathered and sheltered. Although in
the West logos is traditionally translated as discourse or spoken
language—and for Heidegger, of course, language is the realm of
Being—the root term, legein, does not primarily indicate speaking,
but means to lay down, to lay before.
To say is legein. This sentence, if well thought,
now sloughs off  everything facile, trite, and vac-
uous. It names the inexhaustible mystery that
the speaking of language comes to pass from the
unconcealment of what is present. (EGT 64)
Saying and talking occur essentially as the letting-
lie-together-before of everything which, laid in
unconcealment, comes to presence. (EGT 63)
“
A central question for Heidegger concerns the truth of a
being—the Being of the being—at the point of its emergence
into the world. How can we perceive the thing itself, physis in
the moment of its first flowering into meaning, but before its
deflowering by the distortions of opinion and perspective? At
the heart of the matter, says Heidegger in this intensely reflexive
passage, is the possibility of openness to letting, and to the Same:
before us as lying-before. It establishes this as
itself. It lays one and the Same in one. It lays one
as the Same. Such legein lays one and the same,
the omon. Such legein is omologein: One as the
Same, i.e., a letting-lie-before of what does lie
before us, gathered in the self-sameness of its
lying-before. (EGT 66)
