SPEAKING BEING
I fi rst started doing this work I’d get up in front of people and they’d send me up notes saying,
“You are a disgusting person. Get off  it.” But I didn’t know how. And two things allowed me to
get off  it. I gave my word to be a Forum leader. And the people in this room didn’t give up on
me. They were more committed to me than I was.
Kipp then set up for the seminar enrollment. A number of people in The Forum group—many of
them WE&A staff  and Forum leaders—stood and moved to the enrolment tables that were placed
around the room. There followed a period of about 45 minutes during which participants could
register for a seminar series.
At the conclusion of the enrollment period, participants returned to their seats. It was 9:00 pm.
Werner Erhard was on the platform.
ERHARD
Okay, as you know, we’re at the second half of The Forum now. Everybody clear about that?
We’ve done enough going backwards; we’re starting to move forward. Nick?
NICK
You know this thing about mucking around in the swamp at the bottom of the Valley of the
Shadow of Death: I’ve been swimming there for the past couple of months. The thing that I
came face to face with was that I was afraid that I was a nobody. But it was more than being
afraid, it was actually being a nobody. Last night we were driving home and I was sharing with...
ERHARD
Whatever you’re afraid you might be, you are, by virtue of being afraid that you might be. Not
like you are for real. Whatever it is that you can’t be owns you.
NICK
When I was a kid, I had a great childhood, and I had a great friend. My memory of it was... like it
was telepathy. We were completely, totally, absolutely related to each other. One time we both wore
shorts, we both got cowboy boots for Christmas, and we walked around with them on the wrong
feet, and had the best time, always together. We were almost never not together. I ate dinner at his
house, he ate dinner at my house. And then one day during the summer between kindergarten
and fi rst grade, his mother told me they were going to move and I was never going to see him
again. I didn’t quite understand what that meant. One day they loaded everything up in a truck
and a station wagon, and he got in the car and they pulled away and I never saw him again. In this
work on rackets I was looking for this decision that I made, and it wasn’t a decision like something
I could see happening. It was more like pulling out a tablecloth from under everything on the
table. Everything was the same but it was suddenly diff erent. Completely diff erent. I knew there
was something wrong. But it wasn’t like there was something wrong. There was something wrong.
ERHARD
Nick has told this clearly enough that you can get it. I don’t know if you can picture it or not,
but the scenery is all the same. All the scenery is the same except there’s something wrong.
KIPP (continuing)
Forum Day Four: Session Three 471
NICK
I’m not sure that that has something to do with being a nobody, but I think it has something to
do with being a nobody, because when I looked at the alternative to being a nobody, it wasn’t
being somebody, because I created nobody to be somebody. And I know that sounds weird, but
a nobody is a somebody; it’s not a nothing. And yesterday working through our rackets that’s
what I was present to, and this afternoon talking about choice, the thing that I saw that I got
out of all that was that I got to avoid the domination of being responsible for my life. Because,
at that moment, if I could re-create it the way it looked, was... the choice was either to be, was
not either to be nobody or to be somebody, the choice was to be nobody or to have to create it
ongoingly.
ERHARD
You want to get that last thing you said, Nick. That’s a critical point. Say it again.
NICK
The choice wasn’t between being somebody and nobody. The choice was really between being a
somebody called a nobody, or nothing. And that just looked like absolute domination.
ERHARD
The domination of the responsibility to create yourself. Better to be a nobody and avoid the
domination of the responsibility to generate yourself.
NICK
Anything that is an opportunity to be somebody is a hook for me. Anything. And I am like an
addict for...
ERHARD
You understand that Nick sharing this with you takes the air out of it for him to some degree.
That you can’t quite ever do that like you used to once you’ve shared it with people. You can’t
quite get away with it anymore. You know, it’s become a public conversation. And you can’t
get away with it as much anymore. You know Nick will try, because he’s thrown to that. And
you and I will try what we are thrown to. But once you’ve made it public, you can never... it
never quite has the grip on you that it used to. It never quite has the ability to own you that it
used to.
NICK
I really have to laugh at myself, because...
ERHARD
That’s the place you want to get to about your racket.
NICK
There’s really two pieces to that. If you’re a nobody trying to be a somebody: That’s crazy. I
mean, that’s crazy.
472
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Can you hear the craziness in that? If you’re a nobody trying to be somebody, every action
to be a somebody reinforces that you’re nobody. Every time you succeed in being somebody,
it reinforces that you’re nobody. Only people who are nobody try to be somebody. It’s the
whole thing I told you in that short piece I did with you about empty and meaningless:
Even the accomplishments are empty and meaningless, because Nick’s accomplishments
are all in order to be somebody, and each accomplishment simply reinforces that he’s
nobody. Only nobody tries to be somebody. A somebody doesn’t try to be somebody. They
are somebody. You’re not trying to be somebody. Only people who are nobody are trying to
be somebody.
NICK
And that is the thing I was going to say. I’ve got a list of accomplishments that, I mean, I’ve got
a good list of accomplishments. And the way that lives for me is that the past invalidates right
now. And the future, like my dreams or my—nothing highfalutin like a vision—like the thing
Wes was chasing around yesterday, the carrot, all that invalidates right now. It’s not only robbed
me of satisfaction: I was looking at the cost, and clearly happiness is a cost. It also costs me
vitality. I never saw that before. I’m tired all the time.
ERHARD
Sit in the chair and try real hard for about fi ve minutes. It’s a big strain trying. Being is no strain
at all. Trying is very stressful. Work is not stressful. Trying is stressful.
NICK
That was one side of the sword. The other side is I don’t know what makes a somebody
somebody, but whatever the measure is that someone could come up with, I’m somebody. The
other side of the insanity is denying who I am and what that cuts off  is my self-expression. So by
not being myself, and having...
ERHARD
So what you want to get is that the whole conversation is crazy. Being nobody trying to be
somebody and denying that he’s somebody.
NICK
This is the insanity wrapped in the craziness. Werner, I just thank you for the profound
privilege of participating in this work. I can see that who I have been is wanting to be anywhere
but here. The only thing that’s diff erent is me.
ERHARD
By the way, for those of you who were in Beyond the Winning Formula, this is the other side
of “and yet.” One side is the experience of “I’ve accomplished this, and yet...” This is, “I didn’t
accomplish this, and yet...”
Today, as we gather and order the phenomena in our world, we
take for granted that they are. Beyond that, their Being is a matter
with which we don’t concern ourselves.
That we don’t, according to Heidegger, is an outcome
of developments in Greek thinking, and ultimately Western
understanding, beginning with the thinking of the pre-Socratics.
For Heidegger, this period has brought forth the beginning of
philosophy—“one of the few great things of humanity” (IM 17)—
and also the beginning of its end. It bears repeating that “The
great begins great, sustains itself through the free recurrence of
greatness, and if it is great, also comes to an end in greatness. So it
is with the philosophy of the Greeks” (IM 17).
Greek thinking began as “the first and definitive unfolding
of Western philosophy . . . when questioning about beings as
such and as a whole received its true inception” (IM 15). But on
Heidegger’s view, it “came to an end in greatness with Aristotle”
(IM 17). Within two centuries, Greek philosophy had already begun
digging the “ruts of metaphysics.”
What happened? For Heidegger, the evolution of Western
thinking was an evolution in language; and here he turns
specifically to the complex of terms that cluster around the Greek
word on. Simply put, this is the noun-form derived from the verb
to be (i.e., being; the plural is onta). But for Heidegger’s purposes,
putting it simply is not an option, which he explains here:
Thus on says “being” in the sense of to be a
being; at the same time it names a being which
is. In the duality of the participial significance
of on the distinction between “to be” and “a
being” lies concealed. What is here set forth,
which at first may be taken for grammatical
hair-splitting, is in truth the riddle of Being.
(EGT 32–33)
“
Even in contemporary English usage, we can identify examples
of the ambiguity Heidegger is pointing out here. If I tell a friend,
“You are stingy,” that friendship may be at risk. But if my friend

NICK
What I wanted to ask, you know, I’m standing at the threshold of not what I used to call
possibility, but of nothing—like, really nothing.
ERHARD
There is no possibility for an authentic conversation for possibility until you are standing on
nothing. And Nick’s gotten us to the right place because that’s where we are going. We need to
demonstrate something. You have to watch that The Forum gives you a platform to stand on,
and then The Forum is designed to pull the platform out from under you. So remember that
whenever you get set, we’re going to pull the platform out from underneath you. “Oh now I got
that! I got my racket!” Now we’re not interested in rackets. That’s horseshit. What is this rackets
crap? Don’t get stuck back yesterday. Be with today. It’s a new ball game.
(pausing)
The question is: What is the source of action? Why do I act the way I act? I’m defi ning action
broadly. Normally we think of action as just some kind of moving. Consider that your feelings
are a kind of action, a kind of action in the world, and that your thoughts are a kind of action in
the world. And so we’re asking in a broad sense, what is the source of action? Why do you and I act
the way we act? Now there’s a standard answer, isn’t there? There’s an everybody-knows answer;
there’s an everybody-knows answer, isn’t there? If I ask you “Why did you do that?” There’s an
everybody-knows answer, and the answer that everybody knows is “I did it because I fi gured out
that it was the right thing to do,” or “I did it because I have this thing in me that makes me act
automatically, or I did it out of my experience, or my intelligence, or I did it out of my training.”
It’s like that. Why are some people more eff ective in their actions than others? Tell me why. Why
are some people more eff ective in their actions than others? Well some people have more talent
than others, right? So we’ve got this notion that there’s something inside of us whence springs
action. We look at someone and say that person has more talent than me and so they act more
eff ectively than I do. Or he has more experience. Or she has more training than I have. Or he is
more intelligent than I am and so he fi gures it out better than I can. We have an idea it’s talent,
experience, training. I want to get you oriented because it’s not a question anybody asks. Nobody
ever asks you what is the source of action? They ask why did you do that and you come up with
that stupid reason, which doesn’t have any access to the source of action. But if you stop to ask the
question... so I want you dwelling in the question, and I want you dwelling in the answer you dwell
in. Let’s get this “dwelling” straightened out. You don’t think that the source of action is something
inside you. You are that the source of action is something inside you. You don’t need to think it.
Everybody get that? It’s not merely something you think. Without thinking you and I are that the
source of action is something inside of people: either a quality you have, or an experience you have,
or knowledge you have, or something of the sort. And I want you to see that you and I go through
life and deal with life and deal with ourselves dwelling in that the source of action is something
inside of ourselves. Anybody who can’t see that? Get your hand up.
SHERYL
I don’t see it.
takes an action that I find inconsistent with her generally generous
behavior, I may say to her, “You are being stingy.” In the first case,
my statement suggests a defect in the being she is; in the second
case, I am pointing out an unpleasant way she is presently be-ing
that being. The verbal diff erence is slight, but the diff erence in
implication is significant.
By the time of Plato and Aristotle, says Heidegger, on and onta
had become conceptual—that is, they had become representations
of already-thought ideas. They appear for us today as the roots
of the words ontic and ontological. But for the pre-Socratics, who
were for the first time raising questions about existence itself, the
distinction between the event of be-ing—that is, emerging into
unconcealment—and the entity which emerged and persisted, had
never been thought before.
As we have seen, physis is an ambiguous term with a complex of
meanings, including both the event of a being’s emergence into
unconcealment, as well as the being that has thereby emerged
into unconcealment. The early Greek thinkers experienced this
phenomenon in its entirety, says Heidegger. Their world was
grounded in what the scholar Charles Guignon has called an
“event ontology” (A Companion to Heidegger’s Introduction to
Metaphysics. 36)—that is, they experienced not only the beings
in the world, but their emerging and presencing as well.
They experienced the logos as gathering. But they
experienced it, says Heidegger, “without question” (IM 66).
In the thinking of Heraclitus the Being (pres-
encing) of being appeared as logos, as the
Laying that gathers. But this lightning-flash re-
mains forgotten. [. . .] In fact, the Greeks dwelt
in this essential determination of language.
But they never thought it—Heraclitus included.
[. . .] Nowhere do we find a trace of the Greeks
having thought the essence of language direct-
ly from the essence of Being. (EGT 76–77)

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Do you play tennis?
SHERYL
Sometimes.
ERHARD
Are there people who are better than you at tennis?
SHERYL
Yes.
ERHARD
How do you explain their being better?
SHERYL
They play more.
ERHARD
And by playing more what do you mean? It’s not just a matter of playing more, it’s that they
have something inside themselves...
SHERYL
They’ve developed the skill...
ERHARD
Yeah, they’ve developed the skill. They have the experience, but they also carry that around
inside themselves, don’t they?
SHERYL
Yes.
ERHARD
In other words, if they played every day but it didn’t change their insides, they wouldn’t be
better than you are, would they?
SHERYL
Yes, that’s true.
ERHARD
You and I are that the guy who can play tennis better than you or I might be able to do, can do
so because of something inside of him or her. You get the point?
In the terminology of Heidegger’s Being and Time, the pre-Socratic
understanding of their experience was pre-ontological (BT 32).
In Guignon’s words, they never thematized the insight of their
experience (A Companion to Heidegger’s Introduction to Metaphysics.
37). If they had, says Heidegger, the world would undoubtedly be
quite diff erent:
Language would be saying. Language would
be the gathering letting-lie-before of what is
present in its presencing. [. . .] Nothing less
than this: the Greeks would have thought the
essence of language directly from the essence
of Being. . . . (EGT 77)
“
But human thinking took a diff erent path, and “Greek philosophy
never returned to this ground of Being.”
Instead, the focus shift ed to “the foreground of that which comes
to presence . . .” (IM 66, emphasis added). With this shift , Western
thinking began its evolution toward the metaphysical model—what
Guignon calls a “substance ontology” (A Companion to Heidegger’s
Introduction to Metaphysics. 36). Being as the happening of
unconcealment was forgotten, and the ground of reality became the
constant presence of what has been unconcealed—beings as present-
to-hand substance: beings as things.
In his reading of the Anaximander fragment—the oldest
existing fragment of Western thinking—Heidegger finds a further
clue to this evolution of Western thinking into the metaphysical
tradition. The etymological path by which he arrives at this
conclusion is complex and undoubtedly idiosyncratic, but we
quote the passage at length because it resonates at a number of
points with the languaging of Werner Erhard.
From early on [in the thinking of the Greeks] it
seems as though presencing and what is pres-
ent were each something for itself. Presencing
itself unnoticeably becomes something pres-
ent. Represented in the manner of something
present, it is elevated above whatever else is
“
Forum Day Four: Session Three 475
SHERYL
Yes.
ERHARD
That’s the point.
ERHARD
You and I dwell in, you and I come from, you and I are that the source of action is something
inside of people. Is that clear? Like I said before, this is a corollary, a harmonic, an “also.” I’m
going to tell you what I said before because it’s an “also”: That there’s a world out there that is a
certain way and that my job is to get the representation of the world in here...
(pointing both hands at his head)
...which is accurate because I act out of the representation in here on what’s out there. And if
my representation is accurate I will be eff ective in acting with what’s out there. Is that clear?
You don’t think that; you don’t need to: You are that. You are that there’s a world out there, like
an is world: The world is like this. And it isn’t like that. And my job is to get the representation
in here or here,
(pointing to his head and then his heart)
or wherever you think representations are, and my job is to get it out in the world out there
accurately. And some people have more wisdom and more knowledge and more insight than
others. And there are those of us who are arrogant enough to think that we have a special
perspective on the world that allows us to see it rightly: “Those other fools who have just got
it wrong because they’ve got the wrong perspective. Now I’ve got it right, you see?” At any
rate, it’s all the same thing. It’s all that my actions are a product of what I know, or of my
experience, but something inside of me, or the qualities I have. You know, smart, talented,
whatever it is; or stupid, clumsy. You see, clumsy is a quality inside people, isn’t it? They walk
around with it. It’s ready to put to use whenever they need it. That’s the way you and I are
that it is. You and I are that it is like that. Is everybody clear about that now? And then the
corollary: There’s a world out there that is a certain way—what I call an is world—can you
hear “is world”?—an is world rather than a made-up world. There’s an is world; it is a certain
way—and my job is to get a representation in here that’s accurate because I act out of what’s
in here. If what’s in here is accurate then I’ll be eff ective with what’s out there. Does anybody
not get that?
(pausing)
So now we’re going to do a demonstration to look at the source of action, and we’re going to
fi nd out that the source of action is not in here. So I say that the source of action is not in here,
that you don’t have any qualities in you at all. All you’ve got is entrails. Guts. Goop. That’s
what’s inside. Now that’s aff ronting, isn’t it? That’s aff ronting to who you are, because you
are that there’s something inside called qualities and experience and talent and know-how
and intelligence: because that’s the standard interpretation which you are. So I’m saying this
present and so becomes the highest being pres-
ent. [. . .] Ultimately, presencing as such is not
distinguished from what is present: it is taken
merely as the most universal or the highest of
present beings, thereby becoming one among
such beings. The essence of presencing, and
with it the distinction between presencing and
what is present, remains forgotten. The oblivion
of Being is oblivion of the distinction between
Being and beings. (EGT 50)
But Heidegger hastens to add:
However, oblivion of the distinction is by no
means the consequence of a forgetfulness
of thinking. Oblivion of Being belongs to the
self-veiling essence of Being. [. . .] This means
that the history of Being begins with the
oblivion of Being, since Being—together with
its essence, its distinction from beings—keeps
to itself. The distinction collapses. It remains
forgotten. (EGT 50)
“
Here, some light is shed into the clearing of our question: why does
the experience of transformation that is made available in The Forum
occur as perpetually elusive?
What gradually became forgotten was Being’s other aspect:
its nature as emerging, its presencing and withdrawal, the not-
Being which is always the other side of Being. Beings became
understood as permanent presence; lost was the recognition
that the maintenance of the originary power of Being depended
upon the persistence of the struggle, so that the event is
continuously regenerated. Unconcealment is not a once-and-for-all
accomplishment:
476
SPEAKING BEING
counter—commonsensical, counter—“what everybody knows” thing: I’m saying “no, that’s
not the source of action.” We’re going to do a demonstration to see if we can actually get some
insight into the true source of action. What we need is somebody who’s clumsy.
Erhard called on a participant named Ellen, who then mounted the platform.
ERHARD
Thank you. You’ve got to be a little brave to be clumsy, because clumsy is not in.
ELLEN
That’s my racket.
ERHARD
We’re going to play catch in order to demonstrate clumsy, okay?
Erhard and Ellen stood at opposite ends of the platform. Erhard began to toss her a tennis ball. She
caught it several times.
ERHARD
I’m going to make it a little bit harder, because you’re less clumsy than you thought. And they
need to see “clumsy,” so I’m going to bounce the ball in front of you.
Erhard bounced the ball in front of her, and after a few times, she failed to catch the ball to laughter
from the group.
(continuing)
Wait, wait, wait. Missing the ball is not “clumsy.” That’s just missing the ball. The way you deal
with the ball, that’s where clumsy is... Now we’re going to stop playing catch. We’re going to
play a new game called “Which way is the ball spinning?” So you’re going to tell me which way
the ball is spinning, and it doesn’t make any diff erence whether you catch the ball this time or
not.
Erhard threw the ball repeatedly. Ellen caught it some of the time and missed it some. Each time she
reported which way the ball had been spinning, and then tossed it back each time.
(continuing)
So you did that demonstration perfectly. Thank you, you’re wonderful.
Ellen returned to her seat, and Erhard addressed the group.
(continuing)
I started to throw the ball in places that were uncomfortable for her. She also started to use
her body, and to step back to make it easier to catch, instead of stepping forward, which is an
inappropriate reaction but a natural one for someone to whom the ball appears uncatchable.
standing-forth; it alone also preserves beings
in their constancy. Where struggle ceases, be-
ings indeed do not disappear, but world turns
away. . . . Beings now become just something
one comes across; they are findings. [. . .] To be
sure, beings are still given. The motley mass of
beings is given more noisily and broadly than
ever before; but Being has deserted them. (IM
68-69)
“
Language is the house of Being, so language is the site of the
struggle. Being deserts beings when their Saying becomes only
talking, a speaking “in which no world is worlding any more. . .
That which originally holds sway, physis, now degenerates into a
prototype for reproduction and copying” (IM 68-69).
Here Heidegger distinguishes two ways in which appearing
may be understood, which we examined in “The Drift ” sidebar in
Session Two of Day Four, and which we repeat here in an attempt
to open up the space newly: “First, appearing denotes the self-
gathering event of bringing-itself-to-stand and thus standing in
gatheredness. But then, appearing also means: as something
that is already standing there, to proff er a foreground, a surface,
a look as an off ering to be looked at” (IM 203, emphasis added).
Appearing, in its first and “authentic” sense, “rips space open. . .
it first conquers space; as standing there, it creates space for
itself.” Appearing in the second sense “merely steps forth from an
already prepared space, and it is viewed by a looking-at within the
already fixed dimensions of this space” (IM 203-204). Appearing
in the second sense may be characterized as dogma, or received
wisdom, or relating to the self or others as possessing “qualities,”
such as being “stingy” or being “big.” In Werner Erhard’s work, this
distinction is also developed in the term sharing: to share one’s self
in communication is to conquer the space—to create context as
one speaks, and in such a way that shift s the way the world occurs,
with which our actions are correlated.
But here is the tricky part of this distinction: appearing that
rips space open is always ripping space open. Otherwise it would
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day Four: Session Three 477
Nobody told her to do that: How did her actions change? What happened is this: Ellen’s actions
are perfectly correlated to the ball. They’re not perfectly correlated to the “is” ball; they’re
perfectly correlated to the occurring ball. See, you watch where the ball goes, and you’re sitting
out there observing, so the ball looks like it’s more or less diffi  cult to catch, it’s going more or
less fast, or whatever it’s doing, but that’s not what Ellen’s watching. What Ellen was watching
was the occurring ball. You get the diff erence between the two? At fi rst the ball occurred as
fast and small, and her actions were perfectly correlated with a small and fast ball. Later, after
she got oriented, the ball got bigger and slower. Instead of being up there like a threat, it was
fl oating up there, and she could reach up and catch the ball. Now I’m going to make the point
more clearly for you.
Erhard walked to the back of the podium to the table there to get a dictionary.
(walking back holding the dictionary)
So you can tell what the source of action is, we’re going to handle it with the dictionary. So
you’ve got to watch!
Erhard suddenly tossed it off  to one side into the audience. A participant caught it and then tossed it
back. This process was repeated several times.
ERHARD
Do you see any talent down there? Do you see any experience down there? Do you see any
know-how down there? No: just dictionaries fl ying and people’s hands moving. See how
that happens? No talent; no experience: just the dictionary and people’s hands moving. Is
that clear? Action is a correlate of the occurring. However the ball occurs, your actions will be
perfectly correlated. You get a truly uncoordinated person, or a person who calls themselves
uncoordinated, and you lob the ball at them... it doesn’t look like that. It looks like a pea
traveling at supersonic speed. You want to see a true athlete dealing with a pea traveling at
supersonic speed? I’ll show you how clumsy
they look.
Erhard then called for someone who was athletic to come up. Erhard began tossing the ball to this
participant, but threw it widely, to a point where he was unable to catch it. Erhard pointed out to the
group how “clumsy” the athletic participant looked.
(continuing)
That’s how the ball looks to somebody “clumsy,” where the ball occurs as uncatchable. He
acts like Ellen acts, like the occurring “uncatchable ball.” Actions are correlated to the ball as
occurring. Correlate is a diffi  cult word for people because we think in terms of “because,” or
“cause and eff ect.” Correlation is not cause and eff ect. His actions are perfectly correlated to the
ball as an occurring ball. Ellen’s actions are exactly the same: perfectly correlated to the ball as
occurring. Your actions in life, what you do at work, the way you act with your wife or husband,
the way you act with your friends, the way you act with things, are a correlate of the occurring.
become appearing in the second sense: an already prepared space.
Presence as an event of coming-to-presence is always coming-to-
presence, or it becomes constant presence.
To be always coming to presence, a being must be always
withdrawing. If a being’s existence in the world occurs as an event,
then each occurrence of the event must end with a return to the
state from which the event begins. The state from which an event
of Being begins is non-Being; therefore the happening of Being
must include non-Being as the context to which it can return and
from which it can begin.
This was the nature of the sway, where unconcealment always
returned to concealment, and meaninglessness was always the
context for meanings. In bringing the sway to stand in the world,
the pre-Socratics were creating a world in which beings did not
attain a state of constant presence, but were always wavering,
always “held out in a questioning manner into the possibility of
not-Being” (IM 31).
This wavering has been forgotten. Heidegger’s purpose, and
that of The Forum, is its recovery. ■

وجود
من اولین کار را شروع کردم و من جلوی مردم بلند می شوم و آنها یادداشت هایی را برای من ارسال می کنند که می گویند ،
"شما یک فرد منزجر کننده هستید. از آن پیاده شوید." اما من نمی دانستم چگونه. و دو چیز به من اجازه داد
پیاده شوید من حرف خود را دادم تا یک رهبر انجمن باشم. و مردم این اتاق تسلیم نشدند
من آنها نسبت به من متعهد تر بودند. KIPP سپس برای ثبت نام در سمینار تنظیم شد. تعدادی از افراد در گروه انجمن - بسیاری از آنها
آنها و ما و رهبران انجمن و انجمن - ایستادیم و به میزهای ثبت نام که در آن قرار گرفتند حرکت کردیم
در اطراف اتاق طی مدت حدود 45 دقیقه ای که در طی آن شرکت کنندگان می توانستند وجود داشته باشد
برای یک سری سمینار ثبت نام کنید. در پایان دوره ثبت نام ، شرکت کنندگان به صندلی های خود بازگشتند. ساعت 9 بعد از ظهر بود. ورنر ارهارد روی سکو بود. درز
خوب ، همانطور که می دانید ، ما اکنون در نیمه دوم انجمن هستیم. همه در مورد آن پاک هستند؟ ما به اندازه کافی به عقب رفتیم. ما شروع به حرکت به جلو می کنیم. نیک؟ لگد زدن
شما این چیز را در مورد خنجر زدن در باتلاق در پایین دره دره می دانید
Shadow of Death: من دو ماه گذشته در آنجا شنا کردم. چیزی که من
چهره به چهره با او روبرو شدم که می ترسیدم که کسی نباشم. اما این بیش از بودن بود
می ترسید ، در واقع هیچ کس نبود. دیشب ما به خانه رانندگی می کردیم و من با ... erhard به اشتراک می گذاشتم
هرچه می ترسید ممکن است باشید ، به دلیل ترس از اینکه ممکن است باشید. نه
مثل شما واقعی هستید. هرچه این باشد که شما نمی توانید صاحب خود باشید. لگد زدن
وقتی بچه بودم ، دوران کودکی عالی داشتم و یک دوست عالی داشتم. خاطره من از آن ... مثل آن بود
تله پاتی بود ما کاملاً ، کاملاً ، کاملاً با یکدیگر مرتبط بودیم. یک بار ما هر دو پوشیدیم
شورت ، هر دو برای کریسمس چکمه های کابوی گرفتیم و با آنها اشتباه می کردیم
پاها ، و بهترین زمان را داشت ، همیشه با هم. ما تقریباً هرگز با هم نبودیم. من در او شام خوردم
خانه ، او در خانه من شام خورد. و سپس یک روز در طول تابستان بین مهد کودک
و درجه اول ، مادرش به من گفت که آنها قصد حرکت دارند و من هرگز قصد دیدن او را نداشتم
دوباره من کاملاً نفهمیدم که منظورش چیست. یک روز آنها همه چیز را در یک کامیون بارگذاری کردند
و یک واگن ایستگاه ، و او سوار ماشین شد و آنها را بیرون کشیدند و من دیگر هرگز او را ندیدم. در این
کار روی راکت ها من به دنبال این تصمیمی بودم که تصمیم گرفتم ، و این تصمیمی مانند چیزی نبود
من می توانم ببینم که اتفاق می افتد. این بیشتر شبیه به بیرون کشیدن یک سفره از زیر همه چیز بود
جدول همه چیز یکسان بود اما ناگهان متفاوت بود. کاملاً متفاوت است. من آنجا می دانستم
چیزی اشتباه بود اما اینگونه نبود که مشکلی وجود داشته باشد. مشکلی پیش آمد درز
نیک این را به وضوح به اندازه کافی گفته است که می توانید آن را بدست آورید. من نمی دانم که می توانید آن را تصویر کنید یا نه ،
اما مناظر همه یکسان است. تمام مناظر یکسان است به جز اینکه مشکلی وجود دارد. KIPP (ادامه)
روز چهارم انجمن: جلسه سه 471
لگد زدن
من مطمئن نیستم که این ارتباطی با کسی بودن ندارد ، اما فکر می کنم چیزی برای آن داشته باشد
با هیچ کس بودن انجام دهید ، زیرا وقتی من به جایگزین بودن یک کسی نگاه کردم ، اینگونه نبود
کسی بودن ، زیرا من هیچ کس را برای کسی ایجاد نکردم. و من می دانم که به نظر عجیب است ، اما
هیچ کس کسی نیست. این یک چیز نیست. و دیروز از طریق راکت های ما کار می کند
آنچه در آن حضور داشتم ، و امروز بعد از ظهر صحبت در مورد انتخاب ، چیزی که دیدم که دارم
از همه اینها این بود که من مجبور شدم از تسلط بر مسئولیت زندگی خود جلوگیری کنم. چون
در آن لحظه ، اگر من می توانستم دوباره آن را به همان شکلی که به نظر می رسید ، دوباره ایجاد کنم ... انتخاب بود که یا بود ،
نه اینکه کسی نباشد یا کسی نباشد ، انتخاب این نبود که کسی نباشد یا مجبور به ایجاد آن شود
بارها و بارها درز
شما می خواهید آخرین چیزی را که گفتید دریافت کنید ، نیک. این یک نکته مهم است دوباره بگو لگد زدن
انتخاب بین کسی بودن و هیچ کس نبود. انتخاب واقعاً بین بودن بود
کسی به هیچ کس یا هیچ چیز نمی خواند. و این فقط مانند سلطه مطلق به نظر می رسید. درز
تسلط بر مسئولیت ایجاد خود. بهتر است که هیچ کس نباشید و از آن جلوگیری کنید
تسلط بر مسئولیت تولید خود. لگد زدن
هر چیزی که فرصتی برای شخصی بودن باشد برای من قلاب است. هر چیزی و من مثل یک
معتاد برای ... erhard
شما می فهمید که نیک این موضوع را با شما به اشتراک می گذارد ، هوا را تا حدی از آن خارج می کند. این که شما هرگز نمی توانید چنین کاری را انجام دهید مانند گذشته که آن را با مردم به اشتراک گذاشتید. شما نمی توانید
دیگر با آن دور شوید. می دانید ، این یک گفتگوی عمومی است. و شما نمی توانید
به همان اندازه دیگر با آن دور شوید. شما می دانید که نیک سعی خواهد کرد ، زیرا او به آن پرتاب شده است. وت
من و شما سعی خواهیم کرد آنچه را که به آن پرتاب شده ایم. اما هنگامی که آن را عمومی کردید ، هرگز نمی توانید ...
هرگز این نکته را که قبلاً به آن قبلاً دست و پنجه نرم نمی کند ، ندارد. هرگز کاملاً توانایی مالکیت شما را ندارد
عادت داشتن. لگد زدن
من واقعاً باید به خودم بخندم ، زیرا ... erhard
این مکانی است که می خواهید به راکت خود برسید. لگد زدن
واقعاً دو قطعه برای آن وجود دارد. اگر کسی نیستید که کسی باشد: این دیوانه است. من
یعنی ، این دیوانه است 472
وجود
درز
آیا می توانید دیوانگی را در آن بشنوید؟ اگر کسی نیستید که کسی باشد ، هر عملی
برای اینکه کسی باشد تقویت می کند که شما هیچ کس نیستید. هر بار که موفق به کسی هستید ،
این تقویت می کند که شما هیچ کس نیستید. فقط افرادی که هیچ کس سعی نمی کنند کسی باشند. این
کل چیزی که من در آن قطعه کوتاه به شما گفتم در مورد خالی و بی معنی با شما انجام دادم:
حتی دستاوردها خالی و بی معنی است ، زیرا دستاوردهای نیک
همه به منظور اینکه شخصی باشیم ، و هر موفقیت به سادگی تقویت می کند
هیچ کس فقط هیچ کس سعی نمی کند کسی باشد. کسی سعی نمی کند کسی باشد. آنها
کسی هستند شما سعی نمی کنید کسی باشید. فقط افرادی که هیچ کس در تلاش نیستند
کسی باش لگد زدن
و این همان چیزی است که من می خواهم بگویم. من لیستی از دستاوردها را دارم که منظورم این است که من بدست آورده ام
لیست خوبی از دستاوردها. و روشی که برای من زندگی می کند این است که گذشته درست باطل می شود
اکنون و آینده ، مانند رویاهای من یا هیچ چیز بالا مانند یک چشم انداز - مانند چیز
روز دیروز در حال تعقیب بود ، هویج ، همه چیز در حال حاضر بی اعتبار است. این فقط سرقت نشده است
من از رضایت: من به هزینه نگاه می کردم و به وضوح خوشبختی یک هزینه است. همچنین برای من هزینه دارد
سرزندگی من قبلاً هرگز آن را ندیدم. من همیشه خسته ام. درز
در صندلی بنشینید و حدود چند دقیقه واقعی را امتحان کنید. این یک فشار بزرگ است. بودن بدون فشار است
اصلاً تلاش بسیار استرس زا است. کار استرس زا نیست. تلاش استرس زا است. لگد زدن
این یک طرف شمشیر بود. طرف دیگر این است که من نمی دانم چه چیزی باعث می شود کسی
کسی ، اما هر اندازه گیری این است که کسی می تواند با آن روبرو شود ، من کسی هستم. در
طرف دیگر جنون منکر این است که من چه کسی هستم و چه چیزی قطع می شود ، بیان خود من است. بنابراین توسط
خودم نیستم ، و داشتن ... erhard
بنابراین آنچه می خواهید بدست آورید این است که کل مکالمه دیوانه است. هیچ کس سعی در بودن دارد
کسی و انکار اینکه او کسی است. لگد زدن
این جنون پیچیده شده در دیوانگی است. ورنر ، من فقط از شما عمیق تشکر می کنم
امتیاز شرکت در این کار. من می توانم ببینم که من کسی بوده ام که می خواهم در هر کجا باشم
اما اینجا تنها چیزی که متفاوت است من هستم. درز
به هر حال ، برای کسانی از شما که فراتر از فرمول برنده بودند ، این طرف دیگر است
از "و با این حال". یک طرف تجربه "من این کار را انجام داده ام ، و با این حال ..." این است ، "من این کار را نکردم
این کار را انجام دهید ، و با این حال ... "
امروز ، همانطور که در دنیای خود جمع آوری و سفارش می دهیم ، ما
این امر را به عنوان آنها تصور می کنند که آنها هستند. فراتر از آن ، وجود آنها یک موضوع است
که ما خودمان را نگران نمی کنیم. که طبق گفته هایدگر ، نتیجه ای نیست
تحولات در تفکر یونانی و در نهایت غربی
درک ، شروع با تفکر پیش از جامعه. برای هایدگر ، این دوره آغاز شده است
فلسفه - "یکی از معدود چیزهای بزرگ بشریت" (IM 17) -
و همچنین آغاز پایان آن. این تکرار می کند که "
بزرگ شروع می شود ، و از طریق عود آزاد خود پایدار می شود
عظمت ، و اگر عالی باشد ، در عظمت نیز به پایان می رسد. بنابراین آن
با فلسفه یونانیان است "(IM 17). تفکر یونانی به عنوان" اولین و قطعی آشکار شد
فلسفه غربی. بشر بشر هنگام سؤال درباره موجودات
چنین و به طور کلی شروع واقعی خود را دریافت کرد. »(IM 15). اما در
نظر هایدگر ، "با ارسطو به عظمت پایان یافت"
(من 17). طی دو قرن ، فلسفه یونانی از قبل آغاز شده بود
حفر "رودخانه های متافیزیک".
چه اتفاقی افتاد؟ برای هایدگر ، تکامل غربی
تفکر یک تکامل در زبان بود. و در اینجا او می چرخد
به طور خاص به مجموعه اصطلاحاتی که در اطراف یونانی خوشه ای دارند
کلمه روشن به عبارت ساده تر ، این اسمی است که از فعل گرفته شده است
بودن (به عنوان مثال ، بودن ، جمع است). اما برای اهداف هایدگر ،
قرار دادن آن به سادگی گزینه ای نیست ، که او در اینجا توضیح می دهد:
بنابراین در "بودن" به معنای بودن می گوید
بودن در عین حال موجودی را نامگذاری می کند که
است در دوگانگی اهمیت مشارکتی
از تمایز بین "بودن" و "الف
پنهان بودن "پنهان است. آنچه در اینجا آمده است ،
که در ابتدا ممکن است برای دستوری گرفته شود
تقسیم مو ، در حقیقت معمای هستی است. (EGT 32-33)
"
حتی در استفاده از انگلیسی معاصر ، می توانیم نمونه هایی را شناسایی کنیم
از ابهام هایدگر در اینجا اشاره می کند. اگر به یک دوست بگویم ،
"شما لکنت دارید" ، که دوستی ممکن است در معرض خطر باشد. اما اگر دوست من

آنچه من می خواستم بپرسم ، می دانید ، من در آستانه نه آنچه که قبلاً صدا می کردم ایستاده ام
امکان ، اما از هیچ چیز - مانند ، واقعاً هیچ چیز. درز
تا زمانی که روی آن ایستاده باشید ، امکان مکالمه معتبر برای امکان وجود ندارد
هیچی و نیک ما را به جای مناسب رساند زیرا این جایی است که ما می رویم. ما باید
چیزی را نشان دهید شما باید تماشا کنید که این انجمن به شما بستری می دهد تا روی آن بایستید ،
و سپس این انجمن برای بیرون کشیدن پلتفرم از زیر شما طراحی شده است. بنابراین به یاد داشته باشید که
هر زمان که تنظیم شوید ، ما می خواهیم این سکو را از زیر شما بیرون بیاوریم. "اوه حالا من گرفتم
که من راکت خود را گرفتم! " اکنون ما به راکت ها علاقه ای نداریم.
تله؟ دیروز گیر نشوید. امروز با این یک بازی توپ جدید است. (مکث)
سوال این است: منبع عمل چیست؟ چرا من به روشی که عمل می کنم عمل می کنم؟ من اقدامات کمتری دارم
به طور گسترده به طور معمول ما عمل را فقط نوعی حرکت می دانیم. در نظر بگیرید که احساسات خود را
نوعی عمل ، نوعی عمل در جهان است ، و اینکه افکار شما نوعی عمل است
جهان و بنابراین ما به معنای گسترده ای می پرسیم ، منبع عمل چیست؟ چرا من و شما عمل می کنیم
راهی که ما عمل می کنیم؟ اکنون یک پاسخ استاندارد وجود دارد ، وجود ندارد؟ یک پاسخ همه گره وجود دارد.
پاسخ همه افراد وجود دارد ، وجود ندارد؟ اگر از شما بپرسم "چرا این کار را کردی؟" وجود دارد
همه پاسخ می دهند ، و پاسخی که همه می دانند این است: "من این کار را کردم زیرا من از آن خارج شدم
این کار درستی بود "، یا" من این کار را کردم زیرا این کار را در من دارم که باعث می شود عمل کنم
به طور خودکار ، یا من این کار را از تجربه خود یا هوشم انجام دادم ، یا من این کار را از آموزش خود انجام دادم. "
مثل این است چرا برخی از افراد نسبت به سایرین در اقدامات خود تأثیر می گذارند؟ به من بگو چرا چرا
آیا برخی از افراد نسبت به سایرین در اقدامات خود تأثیر می گذارند؟ خوب برخی از افراد استعداد بیشتری دارند
از دیگران ، درست است؟ بنابراین ما این مفهوم را داریم که چیزی در درون ما وجود دارد که از آنجا چشمه ها وجود دارد
عمل ما به کسی نگاه می کنیم و می گوییم که شخص استعداد بیشتری از من دارد و بنابراین آنها بیشتر عمل می کنند
از نظر من از نظر من. یا او تجربه بیشتری دارد. یا او بیشتر از من آموزش دارد. یا او است
باهوش تر از من هستم و بنابراین او بهتر از آنچه می توانم آن را بدست می آورد. ما یک ایده داریم که استعداد است ،
تجربه ، آموزش. من می خواهم شما را گرایش پیدا کنم زیرا این سوالی نیست که کسی از آن می پرسد. هیچ کس
تا به حال از شما می پرسد منبع عمل چیست؟ آنها می پرسند که چرا این کار را کردید و با آن روبرو شدید
این دلیل احمقانه ، که به منبع عمل دسترسی ندارد. اما اگر متوقف شوید
سوال ... بنابراین من می خواهم شما در این سوال ساکن شوید ، و من می خواهم که شما در جواب شما ساکن شوید
در. بیایید این "خانه" را صاف کنیم. شما فکر نمی کنید که منبع عمل چیزی است
درون شما شما این هستید که منبع عمل چیزی در درون شماست. لازم نیست فکر کنید. همه این را دریافت می کنند؟ این فقط چیزی نیست که شما فکر می کنید. بدون اینکه فکر کنم و من هستیم
منبع عمل چیزی در داخل افراد است: یا کیفیتی که دارید یا تجربه ای که دارید ،
یا دانشی که دارید ، یا چیزی از این دست. و من می خواهم که شما ببینید که من و من از آن عبور می کنیم
زندگی و برخورد با زندگی و برخورد با خودمان در این زمینه که منبع عمل چیزی است
درون خودمان کسی که نمی تواند آن را ببیند؟ دست خود را بالا ببرید شیلیل
من آن را نمی بینم عملی را انجام می دهد که من با او به طور کلی سخاوتمندانه مغایرت دارند
رفتار ، ممکن است به او بگویم ، "شما لکنت دارید." در مورد اول ،
بیانیه من حاکی از نقص موجود در موجود است. در دوم
مورد ، من به روشی ناخوشایند اشاره می کنم
این بودن تفاوت کلامی اندک است ، اما تفاوت در
دلالت قابل توجه است. در زمان افلاطون و ارسطو ، می گوید هایدگر ، ON و Onta
مفهومی شده بودند - یعنی آنها به بازنمایی تبدیل شده بودند
از ایده های قبلاً فکر آنها امروز به عنوان ریشه برای ما ظاهر می شوند
از کلمات ontic و هستی شناختی. اما برای پیش از سکوراتیک ها ، که
برای اولین بار بود که در مورد خود وجود سؤالاتی را مطرح می کردند ،
تمایز بین رویداد Being-یعنی در حال ظهور است
عدم تمایل - و موجودی که پدیدار و ادامه یافت ، داشت
قبلاً هرگز فکر نشده بود همانطور که دیدیم ، Physis یک اصطلاح مبهم با مجموعه ای از
معانی ، از جمله هر دو رویداد ظهور یک موجود در
عدم پذیرش ، و همچنین موجودی که از این طریق پدیدار شده است
به عدم پذیرش متفکران یونانی اولیه این موضوع را تجربه کردند
هایدگر می گوید ، پدیده در کلیت آن است. دنیای آنها بود
مبتنی بر آنچه محقق چارلز گینون نامیده است
"هستی شناسی رویداد" (همراهی با معرفی هایدگر در
متافیزیک 36) - این یعنی آنها نه تنها موجودات را تجربه کردند
در جهان ، اما در حال ظهور و حفظ آنها نیز هست. آنها آرم ها را به عنوان جمع آوری تجربه کردند. اما آنها
هایدگر می گوید ، آن را تجربه کرد ، "بدون سوال" (IM 66). در تفکر هراکلیتوس وجود (
رمزگذاری) به عنوان آرم ظاهر می شود.
دراز کشیدن که جمع می شود. اما این رعد و برق دوباره
اصلی فراموش شده است. [ بشر .] در واقع ، یونانیان ساکن بودند
در این تعیین اساسی زبان. اما آنها هرگز آن را تصور نمی کردند - Heraclitus شامل. [ بشر .] هیچ جا اثری از یونانیان پیدا نمی کنیم

بله درز
چگونه بهتر بودن آنها را توضیح می دهید؟ شیلیل

و با بازی بیشتر منظورت چیست؟ این فقط مسئله بازی بیشتر نیست ، بلکه این است که آنها

بله ، آنها مهارت را توسعه داده اند. آنها تجربه دارند ، اما آنها نیز این کار را انجام می دهند

بله درز
به عبارت دیگر ، اگر آنها هر روز بازی می کردند اما آن را تغییر نمی داد ، آنها چنین نخواهند بود
بهتر از شما ، آیا آنها؟ شیلیل
بله ، این درست است درز
من و شما این هستیم که مردی که می تواند تنیس را بهتر از شما بازی کند یا ممکن است بتوانم انجام دهم ، می توانیم انجام دهیم
بنابراین به دلیل چیزی در درون او. شما این نکته را می گیرید؟ در اصطلاحات وجود و زمان هایدگر ، پیش از جامعه
درک تجربه آنها قبل از شناسی بود (BT 32). به قول Guignon ، آنها هرگز بینش خود را موضوعی نکردند
تجربه (همراهی با معرفی هایدگر در متافیزیک. 37). هایدگر می گوید ، اگر آنها داشته باشند ، بدون شک جهان خواهد بود
کاملاً متفاوت:
زبان می گوید زبان
این گردهمایی باشد که اجازه می دهد قبل از آنچه هست
در قسمت اصلی آن حضور دارد. [ بشر .] هیچ چیز کمتر
از این: یونانیان فکر می کردند
جوهر زبان مستقیم از ذات
از وجود بشر بشر بشر (EGT 77)
"
اما تفکر انسان مسیری متفاوت را طی کرد ، و "فلسفه یونانی
هرگز به این زمینه از وجودی برنگشت. "
در عوض ، تمرکز تغییر به "پیش زمینه آنچه می آید
به حضور بشر . " (IM 66 ، تأکید با این تغییر ، غربی.
تفکر تکامل خود را به سمت مدل متافیزیکی آغاز کرد - چه
Guignon یک "هستی شناسی ماده" می نامد (همراهی با هایدگر
مقدمه متافیزیک. 36). بودن به عنوان اتفاق
عدم پذیرش فراموش شد ، و زمین واقعیت به آن تبدیل شد
حضور مداوم آنچه که غیرقابل توصیف بوده است- به عنوان موجود-
ماده به دست: موجودات به عنوان چیزها. در خواندن او از قطعه آناکسیمر - قدیمی ترین
قطعه موجود از تفکر غربی - هیدگر بیشتر می یابد
سرنخ این تکامل تفکر غربی به متافیزیکی
سنت مسیر اخلاقی که او به این کار می رسد
نتیجه گیری پیچیده و بدون شک احمقانه است ، اما ما
گذرگاه را به طول نقل قول کنید زیرا در تعدادی از آن طنین انداز است
با زبان ورنر ارهارد اشاره می کند. از اوایل [در فکر یونانیان]
به نظر می رسد که
ENT هر کدام برای خودش بودند. حاکم
خود به طور غیرقابل انکار به چیزی تبدیل می شود
نفوذ به شیوه چیزی نشان داده شده است
در حال حاضر ، بالاتر از هر چیز دیگری است

روز چهارم انجمن: جلسه سه 475
شیلیل
بله درز
این نکته است درز
من و شما در آن زندگی می کنیم ، من و شما از آنجا آمده ایم ، من و شما هستیم که منبع عمل چیزی است
در داخل مردم آیا این واضح است؟ همانطور که قبلاً گفتم ، این یک نتیجه گیری ، هارمونیک ، "همچنین" است. من هستم
قصد دارم آنچه را که قبلاً گفتم به شما بگویم زیرا این "همچنین" است: دنیایی در آنجا وجود دارد که
روش مشخص و این که کار من این است که نمایندگی جهان را در اینجا بدست آورم ... (اشاره به هر دو دست به سر او)
... که دقیق است زیرا من در اینجا در مورد آنچه در آنجا وجود دارد ، از نمایندگی خارج می شوم. و اگر
نمایندگی من دقیق است ، من در عمل با آنچه در آنجا وجود دارد ، کارآمد خواهم بود. آیا این واضح است؟ شما فکر نمی کنید لازم نیست: شما همین هستید. تو هستی که دنیایی در آنجا وجود دارد ، مانند
جهان IS: جهان اینگونه است. و اینگونه نیست و کار من این است که نمایندگی را بدست آورم
در اینجا یا اینجا ،
(با اشاره به سر او و سپس قلب او)
یا هر کجا که فکر می کنید بازنمایی ها هستند ، و کار من این است که آن را در جهان بیرون بیاورم
با دقت و برخی از افراد خرد و دانش بیشتری دارند و بینش بیشتری از
دیگران. و کسانی از ما هستیم که به اندازه کافی متکبر هستند که فکر می کنند ما یک خاص داریم
چشم انداز جهان که به ما امکان می دهد به درستی آن را ببینیم: "آن احمقان دیگر که تازه دریافت کرده اند
این اشتباه است زیرا آنها دیدگاه اشتباهی دارند. حالا من درست کردم ، می بینید؟ " در هر
نرخ ، همه چیز یکسان است. این همه این است که اقدامات من محصولی از آنچه من می دانم یا از من است
تجربه ، اما چیزی در درون من ، یا خصوصیاتی که دارم. شما می دانید ، باهوش ، با استعداد ،
هرچه هست یا احمقانه ، دست و پا چلفتی. می بینید ، دست و پا چلفتی در افراد با کیفیت است ، اینطور نیست؟ آنها راه می روند
اطراف با آن این آماده است که هر زمان که به آن نیاز داشته باشد استفاده شود. این راهی است که من و شما هستیم
که هست من و شما اینگونه هستیم. آیا اکنون همه در مورد آن روشن هستند؟ و سپس
نتیجه گیری: دنیایی در آنجا وجود دارد که روشی خاص است - آنچه من آن را جهان می نامم - می توانید شما
بشنو "آیا جهان" است؟-جهان است نه یک دنیای ساخته شده. یک جهان است ؛ این یک خاص است
راه - و کار من این است که یک نمایندگی را در اینجا بدست آورم که دقیق است زیرا من از آنچه که هستم عمل می کنم
در اینجا اگر آنچه در اینجا وجود دارد دقیق باشد ، من با آنچه در آنجا وجود دارد ، تأثیر می گذارم. آیا کسی
آن را دریافت نکنید؟ (مکث)
بنابراین اکنون ما می خواهیم یک تظاهرات انجام دهیم تا به منبع عمل نگاه کنیم ، و ما قصد داریم
از این که منبع عمل در اینجا نیست. بنابراین می گویم منبع عمل در اینجا نیست ،
که شما اصلاً خصوصیاتی در خود ندارید. تمام آنچه شما دارید ورودی است. روده گوپ یعنی
چه چیزی در داخل است حالا که این امر به Ronting است ، اینطور نیست؟ این به چه کسی است که شما هستید ، زیرا شما
آیا این چیزی است که در داخل به نام ویژگی ها و تجربه و استعداد و دانش وجود دارد
و هوش: زیرا این تفسیر استانداردی است که شما هستید. بنابراین من این را می گویم
حال و بنابراین بالاترین است
نفوذ [ بشر .] در نهایت ، نگه داشتن چنین نیست
متمایز از آنچه موجود است: گرفته شده است
صرفاً به عنوان جهانی ترین یا بالاترین
موجودات فعلی ، از این طریق یکی از آنها می شود
چنین موجوداتی جوهر نگه داشتن ، و
با آن تمایز بین Presencing و
آنچه موجود است ، فراموش شده است. فراموشی
وجود فراموشی بین تمایز بین
بودن و موجودات (EGT 50)
اما هایدگر عجله می کند تا اضافه کند:
با این حال ، فراموشی از تمایز توسط خیر است
به معنای نتیجه فراموشی است
از فکر کردن فراموشی بودن متعلق به
جوهر خود سازی وجود. [ بشر .] این بدان معنی است
که تاریخ بودن با
فراموشی بودن ، از آنجا که در کنار هم بودن
جوهر آن ، تمایز آن از موجودات - نگهبانان
به خودش تمایز از بین می رود. باقی مانده است
فراموش شده (EGT 50)
"
در اینجا ، برخی از نور در پاکسازی سؤال ما ریخته می شود: چرا این کار را می کند
تجربه تحول که در انجمن در دسترس است
به عنوان دائمی گریزان اتفاق می افتد؟ آنچه که به تدریج فراموش شد جنبه دیگر بودن این بود:
ماهیت آن به عنوان ظهور ، حفظ و عقب نشینی آن ، غیر
بودن که همیشه طرف دیگر هستی است. موجودات شدند
به عنوان حضور دائمی درک می شود. شناخت گمشده بود
که حفظ قدرت اصلی وابسته بودن
با تداوم مبارزه ، به طوری که این رویداد باشد
به طور مداوم بازسازی می شود. عدم پذیرش یک بار و برای همه نیست
موفقیت:

وجود
ضد - commonsical ، counter - "آنچه همه می دانند" چیز: من می گویم "نه ، این است
نه منبع عمل. " ما می خواهیم یک تظاهرات انجام دهیم تا ببینیم آیا واقعاً می توانیم برخی از آنها را بدست آوریم
بینش به منبع واقعی عمل. آنچه ما نیاز داریم کسی است که دست و پا چلفتی است. ارهارد از یک شرکت کننده به نام الن خواست که پس از آن سکو را نصب کرد. درز
ممنون شما باید کمی شجاع باشید که دست و پا چلفتی باشید ، زیرا دست و پا چلفتی نیست. الن
این راکت من است درز
ما برای نشان دادن دست و پا چلفتی می خواهیم بازی کنیم ، خوب؟ ارهارد و الن در انتهای مخالف سکو ایستادند. ارهارد شروع به پرتاب توپ تنیس کرد. او
چندین بار آن را گرفتار کرد. درز
من می خواهم آن را کمی سخت تر کنم ، زیرا شما کمتر از آنچه فکر می کردید دست و پا چلفتی هستید. و آنها
باید "دست و پا چلفتی" را ببینم ، بنابراین می خواهم توپ را در مقابل شما گزاف گویی کنم. ارهارد توپ را در مقابل او گزاف گویی کرد و پس از چند بار ، او نتوانست توپ را به خنده بکشد
از گروه (ادامه)
صبر کنید ، صبر کنید ، صبر کنید. از دست دادن توپ "دست و پا چلفتی" نیست. این فقط توپ را از دست داده است. روشی که شما معامله می کنید
با توپ ، این جایی است که دست و پا چلفتی است ... اکنون ما قصد داریم بازی را متوقف کنیم. ما قصد داریم
یک بازی جدید به نام "توپ در حال چرخش است؟" بنابراین شما می خواهید به من بگویید که کدام راه است
توپ در حال چرخش است ، و هیچ مشکلی ایجاد نمی کند که آیا این بار توپ را می گیرید یا
نه ارهارد بارها و بارها توپ را پرتاب کرد. الن بعضی اوقات آن را گرفت و برخی از آن را از دست داد. هر بار که او
گزارش شده است که توپ در حال چرخش است ، و سپس هر بار آن را به عقب انداخت. (ادامه)
بنابراین شما آن تظاهرات را کاملاً انجام دادید. متشکرم ، شما فوق العاده هستید الن به صندلی خود بازگشت و ارهارد خطاب به این گروه شد. (ادامه)
من شروع به پرتاب توپ در مکانهایی کردم که برای او ناراحت کننده بودند. او همچنین شروع به استفاده کرد
بدن او ، و به عقب برگردد تا بتواند به جای قدم گذاشتن به جلو ، که به جلو می رود ، آسانتر شود.
واکنش نامناسب اما طبیعی برای کسی که توپ به نظر نمی رسد غیرقابل کنترل است. ایستاده- این به تنهایی موجودات را نیز حفظ می کند
در ثبات آنها جایی که مبارزه متوقف می شود ،
واقعاً ناپدید نمی شوند ، اما جهان می چرخد
دور بشر بشر بشر موجودات اکنون فقط به چیزی تبدیل می شوند
یکی به وجود می آید آنها یافته ها هستند. [ بشر .]
مطمئناً ، موجودات هنوز داده شده است. توده موتوری از
به موجودات پر سر و صدا و گسترده تر از آن داده می شود
تا به حال اما بودن آنها را ترک کرده است. (من
68-69)
"
زبان خانه هستی است ، بنابراین زبان سایت آن است
مبارزه وقتی که گفته هایشان فقط می شود بیابان بودن موجودات
در حال صحبت کردن ، صحبت کردن "که در آن هیچ دنیایی دیگر در حال جهان نیست. آنچه که در ابتدا دارای نوسان است ، فیزیک ، اکنون به یک انحطاط می رسد
نمونه اولیه برای تولید مثل و کپی کردن "(IM 68-69). در اینجا هایدگر دو روش ظاهر شدن را متمایز می کند
ممکن است درک شود ، که ما در نوار کناری "رانش" در آن بررسی کردیم
جلسه دو روز چهارم ، و ما در اینجا در اینجا تکرار می کنیم
برای باز کردن فضا به تازگی: "اول ، ظاهر نشانگر خود است
جمع آوری رویداد از آوردن-خود به خود به استند و در نتیجه ایستادن در
جمع شدن اما پس از آن ، ظاهر شدن نیز به معنای: به عنوان چیزی است
که در حال حاضر در آنجا ایستاده است ، تا یک پیش زمینه ، یک سطح ،
نگاهی به عنوان بی نظیری که باید مورد بررسی قرار گیرد "(IM 203 ، تأکید اضافه شده است). ظاهر می شود ، در اولین و" معتبر "خود ،" فضا را باز می کند. بشر بشر ابتدا فضا را فتح می کند. همانطور که در آنجا ایستاده است ، فضای آن را ایجاد می کند
خودش. " ظاهر شدن به معنای دوم "صرفاً از یک
در حال حاضر فضای آماده شده ، و توسط یک نگاه در داخل مشاهده می شود
ابعاد ثابت این فضا "(IM 203-204). ظاهر می شود
به معنای دوم ممکن است به عنوان دگما مشخص شود یا دریافت شود
خرد ، یا مربوط به خود یا دیگران به عنوان داشتن "خصوصیات" ،
مانند "لکنت" بودن یا "بزرگ بودن". در کار ورنر ارهارد ، این
تمایز نیز در اصطلاح اشتراک ایجاد شده است: به اشتراک گذاشتن خود شخص
در برقراری ارتباط فاتح فضا است - برای ایجاد زمینه به عنوان
یکی صحبت می کند ، و به گونه ای که به شکلی که جهان رخ می دهد تغییر می کند ،
که اقدامات ما با آنها ارتباط دارد. اما در اینجا بخش پیچیده این تمایز است: ظاهر آن
Rips Space Open همیشه فضای باز را باز می کند. در غیر این صورت
erhard (ادامه)
روز چهارم انجمن: جلسه سه 477
هیچ کس به او نگفت که این کار را انجام دهد: اقدامات او چگونه تغییر کرد؟ آنچه اتفاق افتاد این است: اقدامات الن
کاملاً با توپ همبستگی دارند. آنها کاملاً با توپ "IS" همبستگی ندارند. آنها هستند
کاملاً با توپ موجود در ارتباط است. ببینید ، شما تماشا می کنید که توپ به کجا می رود ، و شما نشسته اید
در آنجا مشاهده می شود ، بنابراین توپ به نظر می رسد که کم و بیش فرقه متفاوتی برای گرفتن است ، بیشتر می رود یا
کمتر سریع ، یا هر کاری که انجام می دهد ، اما این چیزی نیست که الن تماشا می کند. آنچه الن تماشا می کرد
توپ رخ داده بود شما تفاوت بین این دو را می گیرید؟ در اولین بار توپ اتفاق افتاد
سریع و کوچک ، و اقدامات او کاملاً با یک توپ کوچک و سریع همبستگی داشت. بعد ، بعد از
او گرایش پیدا کرد ، توپ بزرگتر و کندتر شد. به جای اینکه مانند یک تهدید در آنجا باشد ، این بود
در آنجا به سمت بالا می رود ، و او می توانست برسد و توپ را بگیرد. اکنون می خواهم این نکته را بیان کنم
واضح تر برای شما Erhard به پشت تریبون به سمت میز آنجا رفت تا یک فرهنگ لغت بدست آورد. (در حال عقب نگه داشتن فرهنگ لغت)
بنابراین می توانید بگویید که منبع عمل چیست ، ما می خواهیم آن را با فرهنگ لغت اداره کنیم. اینقدر
شما باید تماشا کنید! ارهارد ناگهان آن را به یک طرف به مخاطب انداخت. یک شرکت کننده آن را گرفت و سپس آن را پرتاب کرد
بازگشت این روند چندین بار تکرار شد. درز
آیا استعدادی در آنجا مشاهده می کنید؟ آیا در آنجا تجربه ای مشاهده می کنید؟ آیا شما هر چیزی را می بینید
دانش را در آنجا پایین؟ نه: فقط فرهنگ لغت ها و دست مردم در حال حرکت هستند. ببینید چگونه
این اتفاق می افتد؟ بدون استعداد ؛ بدون تجربه: فقط فرهنگ لغت و دست مردم در حال حرکت است. است ،
این واضح است؟ عمل همبستگی رخ داده است. با این حال توپ رخ می دهد ، اقدامات شما خواهد بود
کاملاً همبسته شما یک شخص واقعاً بدون هماهنگ یا شخصی که خود را صدا می کند می گیرید
بدون هماهنگی ، و شما توپ را به سمت آنها می زنید ... به نظر نمی رسد چنین باشد. به نظر می رسد نخود فرنگی است
سفر با سرعت مافوق صوت. شما می خواهید یک ورزشکار واقعی را ببینید که با یک نخود در حال مسافرت است
سرعت مافوق صوت؟ من به شما نشان خواهم داد که چقدر دست و پا چلفتی است
آنها نگاه می کنند. سپس ارهارد خواستار کسی شد که ورزشکار باشد. Erhard شروع به پرتاب توپ به این کار کرد
شرکت کننده ، اما آن را به طور گسترده ای پرتاب کرد ، تا جایی که او نتوانست آن را بدست آورد. ارهارد به
گروه چگونه "دست و پا چلفتی" شرکت کننده ورزشکار به نظر می رسید. (ادامه)
اینگونه است که توپ به کسی "دست و پا چلفتی" نگاه می کند ، جایی که توپ به عنوان غیرقابل تحمل اتفاق می افتد. او
اعمال مانند الن اعمال می شود ، مانند "توپ غیرقابل تحمل". اقدامات با توپ همبستگی دارد
اتفاق می افتد همبستگی یک کلمه فرقه متفاوتی برای مردم است زیرا ما از نظر "زیرا" یا فکر می کنیم
"علت و علت." همبستگی علت و معلولیت نیست. اقدامات او کاملاً با
توپ به عنوان یک توپ موجود. اقدامات الن دقیقاً یکسان است: کاملاً با توپ همبستگی دارد
اتفاق می افتد اقدامات شما در زندگی ، کاری که در محل کار انجام می دهید ، روشی که با همسر یا شوهر خود عمل می کنید ،
روشی که با دوستان خود عمل می کنید ، روشی که با امور عمل می کنید ، همبستگی اتفاقات است. به معنای دوم ظاهر شوید: فضایی که از قبل آماده شده است. حضور به عنوان رویدادی برای حضور در ادامه همیشه به
حضور ، یا حضور مداوم می شود. برای همیشه به حضور ، یک موجود همیشه باید باشد
عقب نشینی اگر وجود موجود در جهان به عنوان یک رویداد رخ دهد ،
سپس هر وقوع این رویداد باید با بازگشت به
حالت که از آن رویداد شروع می شود. دولتی که از آن یک رویداد
از شروع کار غیرقانونی است. بنابراین اتفاق بودن
باید شامل عدم پیوستن به عنوان زمینه ای باشد که می تواند به آن برگردد و
که از آن می تواند شروع شود. این ماهیت نوسان بود ، جایی که همیشه عدم تمایل
به پنهانکاری بازگشت ، و بی معنی همیشه بود
زمینه برای معانی. در آوردن نوسان برای ایستادن در جهان ،
پیش سکوراتیک دنیایی را ایجاد می کرد که موجودات در آن نبودند
به یک حالت حضور مداوم برسید ، اما همیشه موج می زدند ،
همیشه "به شکلی سؤال برانگیز می شود
not-being "(IM 31). این موج دار فراموش شده است. هدف هایدگر ، و
این انجمن ، بهبودی آن است. ■
