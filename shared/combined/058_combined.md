SPEAKING BEING
MARY
No, I do what I do.
ERHARD
You say, “Hey Werner, I’m going to meet you tomorrow at noon...”
MARY
And I’ll get there at two.
ERHARD
But you don’t say, “But Werner, I may show up and I may not.”
MARY
No.
ERHARD
That’s the inauthenticity. If you went around saying to people, “Look, I’ll give my word, and
maybe I’ll keep it and maybe I won’t.” Nothing inauthentic about that—that’s quite straight.
MARY
And I’m right about that.
ERHARD
We’ll discuss more about that later. You get what I mean about that being inauthentic? Anybody
who can’t see that?
JAKE
I make the best eff ort to... I don’t understand.
ERHARD
Let me tell you how I listen. I just told you that one and one equals two. And I asked you if you
got that, and you said you’re confused. So I think you’ve got something going on in this area.
JAKE
That’s one of the reasons why I raised my hand.
ERHARD
You’re not confused; you’ve got something going on.
JAKE
I’ve got something going on.
Getting It and Losing It
The Forum content is communicated through the gradual
development of a series of distinctions. These distinctions off er
access to a certain way of being; they are ontological clearings,
contexts of meaning. They shape the way the circumstances of
life occur so that a new way of being with those circumstances
arises naturally. The new way of being becomes a possibility when
the distinction is “gotten”—in Heideggerian terms, in a moment
of Augenblick, or ontological insight. Thus the purpose of The
Forum is to have participants “get” the distinctions deeply enough
during the course of the four days that they leave The Forum
dwelling in those distinctions. As Erhard told The Forum leaders
during a debriefing, “What makes a diff erence is that there is a
conversation generated that distinguishes the distinction, and that
they’re dwelling in the conversation,” that is, they are “used by”
the distinction rather than caught up trying to remember a piece of
information as a precondition to being able to apply it.
Forum Day One: Session Two
45
ERHARD
What have you got going on?
JAKE
I’m one of those people who stood up that said I’m a person of my word.
ERHARD
And you’re not. Isn’t that true? You do what you say you’re gonna do?
JAKE
I damn well try.
ERHARD
Very good. “I am a person who will do what I say I am going to do, when in fact, I am only a
person who will try to do what I said I will do, and what I mean by try is, given the way I see
things, which will be generated by my feelings, my mood, if I can see that I can’t do it, I won’t
do it. But I’m not gonna tell you that. I’m going to tell you that I’m a person of my word.”
Erhard sat on the edge of the platform facing Jake.
ERHARD (continuing)
Try to sit down.
(Jake sat)
No, you sat down.
(Jake stood)
I didn’t say sit down. Try to sit down.
(again he sat)
No, you’re sitting. I said try to sit.
JAKE
I’m not getting it.
ERHARD
You’re getting it. You don’t like it. Trying to sit down looks a lot like standing up. You’re just a
bullshit artist. That’s not a bad thing to be, by the way. It’s just a thing with no power.
JAKE
I’m getting that, but I don’t see the point. What is it worth?
The Heideggerian notion of “dwelling” is central to the way
in which The Forum material is to be assimilated. Dwelling, for
Erhard, is synonymous with “coming from”—that is, to dwell
in a context is to come from that context into one’s life, or to
allow oneself to be given being by that context. Heidegger
called dwelling “the basic character of Being in keeping with
which mortals exist” (“BDT” in PLT 158). Dwelling, for Heidegger,
designates that ontological state in which we attain our essential
relatedness to the world, so we must “think for the sake of
dwelling” (“BDT” in PLT 159).
However, a point that we will introduce here and to which
we will return throughout this book, is that Being withdraws. The
ontological communication of The Forum, the speaking of Being,
occurs always in this precarious context: it wavers on the brink
of concealment. Thus the process of dwelling-in-a-distinction
consists of repeatedly “getting” and “losing” that distinction.
Erhard consistently tells his audiences that if they “got it and it
went away,” that is the appropriate way to assimilate ontological
communication: “That’s the way it’s supposed to happen,” he says,
“getting and losing and getting and losing and getting and losing”
(“Beyond the Winning Formula”). This is an essential aspect of the
ontological rhetoric whose nature we are developing here, and it is
consistent with the authors’ own experience of having participated
in Werner Erhard’s programs: the insights that we have attained in
the process have occurred waveringly.
As we have participated over the years in courses and
seminars based in Erhard’s work, something would oft en be
said which in that instant produced an illuminating insight, but
which seemed, a moment or an hour later, to be simply words,
or even incomprehensible jargon. Longitudinally, however—over
the years of our participation in this work—we are aware of a
parallel development: a gradually increasing dwelling-in the way
of being that has been opened up by the distinctions which we are
simultaneously getting and losing. Further, this ongoing dwelling-
in has, over the years, become more salient than the getting
and losing. That is, we notice that we increasingly act from the
46
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Let me tell you something, my friend. You’re not going to get anything out of here you can do
something with. Do you think I’m going to give an asshole tools? What you walk out of here
with will give you freedom. You won’t use it. It will use you. I have read all the books, and I’ve
gotten value; but that’s not transformational.
JAKE
I don’t know where you’re coming from with this asshole stuff .
ERHARD
It’s not because you are one. I don’t call you an asshole because it’s an apt description. I call you
that because it has an impact. If I wanted to call you the right name I’d call you Jake.
JAKE
I’m doing a good job as I listen to you, as we talk about keeping your word and things like that. I’m
aware of the burden I infl ict on myself with trying to keep my word.
ERHARD
And you see, when you walk out of here, you will be free to be your word. There will be no
burden in your word. Not bad. It’s worth something isn’t it? But you haven’t the remotest clue
about how to get there. You couldn’t get there in a billion years. Now we need you to get there,
but you’re stuck in this area. So that’s my business.
(laughter)
If I need someone in your business to do something, I don’t come to me, because I’m an asshole
in your business. You aren’t going to know when this is working and when it’s not working.
You wouldn’t know if we were there if we fell over it, because you look for the wrong kind of
evidence. Stop worrying about whether it’s working. That’s my job. I don’t mean to attack your
sincerity. Your sincerity is not worth attacking, because it’s worthless.
JAKE
That almost sounded like an apology.
ERHARD  (looking out at the group)
Your sincerity is worthless because you’re still standing when you try to sit down. Now, I’ve got
to live with your standing, not with your trying. This is like a cult of assholes.
JAKE
It sounds like you’re condoning being a real sloppy person about your word.
ERHARD
That’s what hooked you, isn’t it?
way-of-being made available by the distinctions of Erhard’s work;
that way-of-being is the ontological “place” we come from into the
encounters of our lives.
Two significant qualifications must be added here. First, we
have generalized what has been produced by our participation
in Erhard’s work as “a way of being.” This is of course a gloss on
an existential phenomenon that defies capture by words. On the
one hand we sense, in our recent experiences in the seminars of
Landmark Worldwide, what we might call reverberations that are
harmonic with our earliest experiences of Erhard’s work. At the
same time, since each of us is the way of being whose evolution we
are addressing, we obviously have no place to stand outside that
evolution from which to address it.
Second, these years have included years when we have
participated regularly and frequently in Erhard’s work, and years
when we have not participated at all. Our assessment of this
process is that our experience of life has been enhanced during
those periods of participation. Certainly there have been ups
and downs in every period; but the phenomenon that Erhard
calls transformation does indeed live in language, and it is our
experience that regular participation in the conversation keeps
it alive. And for us, even in the nonparticipating periods, the
development of the distinctions remains ongoing just in the
process of life itself.
Thus the purpose of The Forum is to communicate the
distinctions repeatedly and at suff icient length such that
participants can move, as far as possible, from getting them to
dwelling in them. “Why we’re going on and on down there,” Erhard
told The Forum leaders during a debriefing session, “is so that
the distinctions are transferred from something people get to
something they come from.”
Therefore, we request that readers consider this possibility in
approaching the ideas in this book. If something we say seems, at
one moment, to make sense, but upon further reflection doesn’t,
that may be the way it should be assimilated.
For the senior author, the point which Erhard was making
at this particular juncture of The Forum—that I present myself as
Forum Day One: Session Two
47
JAKE
Yep.
ERHARD
It sounded like I was attacking one of your sacred beliefs. You couldn’t tolerate being a guy who
said he would do it and didn’t do it. You couldn’t listen to the rest of what I said, and got con-
fused. You can’t live with being a guy who doesn’t keep his word.
JAKE
I think I have good reasons for not doing it.
ERHARD
I didn’t say it wasn’t a valid story. I love everybody’s story. But you can’t ask about it, “true” or
“false”? Is it really true that you couldn’t do it? What’s true is that you
t
didn’t do it. Sometimes a
t
cigar is just a cigar, as Freud said. Listen, you can’t be with that. You can’t be with the possibility
of not being your word. And you know what? Something happened, when you were a kid, and
you couldn’t be that anymore.
JAKE
This is something I value.
ERHARD
I know. You’re nutty about it.
JAKE
Yes I am a nut about it.
ERHARD
And anything you’re nutty about you have no freedom with.
JAKE
What’s the value in being two hours late just because you want to be two hours late?
ERHARD
I never said anything like that. You said that. You’re so nutty you’re hearing voices. That’s part
metaphorical and part literal.
JAKE
No, somebody did say that.
MARY
I said that, but I didn’t say I wouldn’t try.
someone who keeps my word, whereas in reality I keep my word
when I cannot justify not keeping it—wavers for me as I consider
it. I see its validity: I do keep my promises and adhere to my
agreements, but only until I see some overriding justification for
breaking them. I obey most laws—my social contracts—except
for certain laws which I justify not keeping: for example, I cannot
personally justify cheating on my income tax returns, but I oft en
justify exceeding the speed limit. The classic ethical dilemma—
whether one would tell an axe murderer the “truth” about the
location of his innocent quarry—can be seen as a variation of this
same point: I tell the truth until I can justify not telling it.
And yet I notice my resistance to accepting this when it is
put so baldly. Protestations of my “honesty” leap to mind: it is
not that I keep my word depending on how I feel about it, it is
that I always keep my word except when there is some overriding
reason not to. But—and here is the point Erhard is driving
toward—isn’t that simply the same “what happened” with a
diff erent “story” attached to it? Isn’t it true that I either keep my
word or I don’t, and then I add a story, a justification of some
nature for whichever action I take? Doesn’t the “what happened”
remain unaltered, regardless of the explanation or justification I
attach to the event?  ■

توسعه یک سری تمایز. این تمایزها از آنجا
دسترسی به یک روش خاص بودن ؛ آنها پاکسازی هستی شناختی هستند ،

به طور طبیعی بوجود می آید. روش جدید بودن در صورت امکان
تمایز "در اصطلاحات هایدگریایی" در یک لحظه "بدست آمده است"
از Augenblick یا بینش هستی شناختی. بنابراین هدف از
انجمن این است که شرکت کنندگان تمایزات را به اندازه کافی عمیق بگیرند
در طول چهار روز که آنها از انجمن خارج می شوند
ساکن در آن تمایزات. همانطور که Erhard به رهبران انجمن گفت
در حین دزدی ، "آنچه باعث ایجاد تفاوت می شود این است که وجود دارد
مکالمه ایجاد می کند که تمایز را متمایز می کند ، و آن
آنها در گفتگو زندگی می کنند ، "یعنی آنها" مورد استفاده "قرار می گیرند

نه ، شما نشستید. (جیک ایستاد)
من نگفتم بنشین سعی کنید بنشینید. (دوباره او نشست)
نه ، شما نشسته اید. گفتم سعی کن بنشین جیک
من آن را نمی گیرم درز
شما در حال دریافت آن هستید. شما آن را دوست ندارید. تلاش برای نشستن بسیار شبیه به ایستادن است. شما فقط یک
هنرمند مزخرف. به هر حال ، این بد نیست. این فقط یک چیز بدون قدرت است. جیک
من این را می گیرم ، اما من این نکته را نمی بینم. ارزشش چیست؟ مفهوم هایدگرین از "مسکونی" برای راه مهم است
که در آن مطالب انجمن قرار می گیرد. سکونت ، برای
erhard ، مترادف با "آمدن از" است.
در یک زمینه این است که از آن زمینه به زندگی شخص یا به
به خود اجازه دهید که در این زمینه قرار بگیرد. هیدگر
به نام مسکونی "شخصیت اصلی بودن
کدام فانی وجود دارد "(" BDT "در PLT 158). مسکونی ، برای هایدگر ،
آن وضعیت هستی شناختی را که در آن به دست می آوریم تعیین می کند
ارتباط با جهان ، بنابراین ما باید به خاطر این فکر کنیم
سکونت "(" BDT "در PLT 159). با این حال ، نکته ای که ما در اینجا معرفی خواهیم کرد و به کدام یک
ما در سراسر این کتاب باز خواهیم گشت ، این است که عقب نشینی می شود. در
ارتباط هستی شناختی انجمن ، صحبت از هستی ،
همیشه در این زمینه نامطلوب اتفاق می افتد: در آستانه موج می زند
پنهان کردن بنابراین روند مسکن در یک فاصله
این تمایز مکرر "گرفتن" و "از دست دادن" است. Erhard به طور مداوم به مخاطبان خود می گوید که اگر آنها آن را دریافت کنند و آن را
از بین رفت ، "این روش مناسب برای جذب هستی شناختی است
ارتباطات: "او می گوید:" این راهی است که قرار است اتفاق بیفتد. "
"گرفتن و از دست دادن و گرفتن و از دست دادن و از دست دادن"
("فراتر از فرمول برنده"). این یک جنبه اساسی از
بلاغت هستی شناختی که ماهیت ما در اینجا در حال توسعه هستیم ، و این است
مطابق با تجربه خود نویسندگان از شرکت در
در برنامه های ورنر ارهارد: بینش هایی که به دست آورده ایم
این روند به طرز چشمگیری رخ داده است. همانطور که ما در طول سالها در دوره ها شرکت کرده ایم و
سمینارهای مستقر در کار Erhard ، چیزی که اتفاق می افتد
گفت که در آن لحظه یک بینش روشنایی ایجاد کرده است ، اما
که به نظر می رسید ، یک لحظه یا یک ساعت بعد ، به سادگی کلمات ،
یا حتی جارگون غیرقابل درک. از نظر طولی ، با این حال -
سالهای مشارکت ما در این کار - ما از a آگاه هستیم
توسعه موازی: یک مسکن به تدریج در حال افزایش است
از موجودی که با تمایزاتی که ما هستیم باز شده است
همزمان گرفتن و از دست دادن. علاوه بر این ، این مسکن مداوم-
با گذشت سالها ، بیش از این که برجسته تر شود

بگذارید چیزی به شما بگویم ، دوست من. شما نمی خواهید چیزی از اینجا دریافت کنید که می توانید انجام دهید
چیزی با فکر می کنید من می خواهم یک ابزار آسفالت ارائه دهم؟ آنچه از اینجا بیرون می روید
با اراده به شما آزادی می دهد. شما از آن استفاده نمی کنید. از شما استفاده خواهد کرد من تمام کتاب ها را خوانده ام ، و
ارزش بدست آمده اما این تحول گرا نیست. جیک
من نمی دانم که با این چیزهای آسفالت از کجا آمده اید. درز
این به این دلیل نیست که شما یکی هستید. من شما را به عنوان یک آسفالت نمی نامم زیرا این یک توصیف مناسب است. من به شما زنگ می زنم
این به دلیل تأثیرگذاری است. اگر می خواستم نام درستی با شما تماس بگیرم ، شما را جیک صدا می کنم. جیک
من وقتی به شما گوش می دهم ، کار خوبی انجام می دهم ، زیرا در مورد نگه داشتن کلام و مواردی از این دست شما صحبت می کنیم. من هستم
با تلاش برای حفظ حرف خود از من آگاه هستم که خودم را تحت تأثیر قرار می دهم. درز
و می بینید ، وقتی از اینجا بیرون می روید ، آزاد خواهید بود که کلمه خود باشید. وجود نخواهد داشت
بار در کلام شما بد نیست ارزش چیزی ندارد؟ اما شما سرنخ دورافتاده ای ندارید
در مورد نحوه رسیدن به آنجا شما نمی توانید طی یک میلیارد سال به آنجا برسید. اکنون ما برای رسیدن به آنجا به شما نیاز داریم ،
اما شما در این منطقه گیر کرده اید. این کار من است (خنده)
اگر من به کسی در کار شما نیاز دارم تا کاری انجام دهد ، من به من نمی آیم ، زیرا من یک آسفالت هستم
در تجارت شما شما نمی خواهید بدانید که این کار چه زمانی کار می کند و چه زمانی کار نمی کند. شما نمی دانید اگر ما روی آن سقوط کردیم ، ما آنجا بودیم ، زیرا شما به دنبال نوع اشتباه هستید
شواهد دیگر نگران این موضوع باشید که آیا کار می کند. این کار من است من قصد حمله به شما را ندارم
اخلاص اخلاص شما ارزش حمله ندارد ، زیرا بی ارزش است. جیک
این تقریباً مانند عذرخواهی به نظر می رسید. erhard (نگاه کردن به گروه)
اخلاص شما بی ارزش است زیرا هنوز وقتی سعی می کنید بنشینید ، ایستاده اید. اکنون ، من دارم
برای زندگی با ایستاده خود ، نه با تلاش خود. این مانند فرقه ای از آسفالت است. جیک
به نظر می رسد که شما در مورد یک شخص واقعی و شیب دار در مورد کلام خود محکوم هستید. درز
این چیزی است که شما را قلاب کرده است ، اینطور نیست؟ راه از طریق تمایز کار Erhard در دسترس است.
این روش "مکان" هستی شناختی است که ما از آن وارد می شویم
برخوردهای زندگی ما. دو صلاحیت مهم باید در اینجا اضافه شود. اول ، ما
آنچه را که توسط مشارکت ما تولید شده است ، تعمیم داده اند
در کار Erhard به عنوان "راهی برای بودن". این البته براق است
یک پدیده وجودی که با دستگیری با کلمات مخالف است. در
یک دست ما احساس می کنیم ، در تجربیات اخیر ما در سمینارها
نقطه عطف در سراسر جهان ، آنچه ما ممکن است Reverberations بنامیم
هارمونیک با اولین تجربیات ما در مورد کار Erhard. در
در همان زمان ، از آنجا که هر یک از ما راهی است که تکامل آن است
آدرس می دهند ، ما بدیهی است که جایی برای ایستادن در خارج از آن نداریم
تکامل که از آن برای پرداختن به آن استفاده می شود. دوم ، این سالها شامل سالهایی است که ما داریم
به طور مرتب و مکرر در کار و سالها Erhard شرکت می کرد
وقتی ما اصلاً شرکت نکرده ایم. ارزیابی ما از این
روند این است که تجربه ما از زندگی در طول
آن دوره های مشارکت. مطمئناً UPS وجود داشته است
و در هر دوره سقوط می کند. اما پدیده ای که erhard است
تحول در واقع در زبان زندگی می کند ، و این ماست
تجربه مشارکت منظم در مکالمه را حفظ می کند
زنده است و برای ما ، حتی در دوره های غیر همکار ،
توسعه تمایزها فقط در
روند زندگی خود. بنابراین هدف از انجمن برقراری ارتباط با
تمایزها به طور مکرر و در طول کافی به گونه ای که
شرکت کنندگان می توانند تا حد امکان از رسیدن آنها حرکت کنند
ساکن در آنها. ارهارد گفت: "چرا ما آنجا می رویم و پایین می رویم."
به رهبران انجمن در طی یک جلسه دبورینگ گفت ، "به این ترتیب است
تمایزها از چیزی که مردم به آن می رسند منتقل می شود
چیزی که از آنها آمده است. "
بنابراین ، ما درخواست می کنیم که خوانندگان این امکان را در نظر بگیرند
نزدیک شدن به ایده ها در این کتاب. اگر چیزی که می گوییم به نظر می رسد ، در
یک لحظه ، معقول ، اما پس از تأمل بیشتر ،
این ممکن است راهی باشد که باید جذب شود. برای نویسنده ارشد ، نکته ای که Erhard بیان می کرد
در این بخش خاص از انجمن - که من خودم را معرفی می کنم
روز اول انجمن: جلسه دو

جیک
بله درز
به نظر می رسید که من به یکی از اعتقادات مقدس شما حمله می کردم. شما نمی توانید یک پسر بودن را تحمل کنید
گفت که او این کار را خواهد کرد و این کار را نکرد. شما نمی توانید به بقیه آنچه گفتم گوش دهید ، و
ذوب شده شما نمی توانید با پسری زندگی کنید که حرف خود را حفظ نمی کند. جیک
من فکر می کنم دلایل خوبی برای عدم انجام آن دارم. درز
من نگفتم که این یک داستان معتبر نبود. من داستان همه را دوست دارم. اما شما نمی توانید در مورد آن سؤال کنید ، "درست" یا
"دروغ"؟ آیا واقعاً درست است که شما نمی توانید این کار را انجام دهید؟ آنچه درست است این است که شما
حرف
این کار را نکردم گاهی اوقات
حرف
همانطور که فروید گفت سیگار فقط یک سیگار است. گوش دهید ، شما نمی توانید با آن باشید. شما نمی توانید با این امکان باشید
از اینکه کلام تو نیست و می دانید چه؟ اتفاقی افتاد ، وقتی بچه بودی ، و
شما دیگر نمی توانید چنین باشید. جیک
این چیزی است که من برای آن ارزش قائل هستم. درز
من می دانم شما در مورد آن مغذی هستید. جیک
بله من یک آجیل در مورد آن هستم. درز
و هر چیزی که در مورد شما دلخراش نیستید ، آزادی ندارید. جیک
دو ساعت دیر بودن فقط به این دلیل که می خواهید دو ساعت با تأخیر داشته باشید چقدر است؟ درز
من هرگز چنین چیزی نگفتم. شما این را گفتید شما بسیار مغذی هستید که صداهایی را می شنوید. این بخشی است
استعاره و بخشی از آن. جیک
نه ، کسی این حرف را زد. مریم
من این را گفتم ، اما من نگفتم که سعی نمی کنم. کسی که حرف من را نگه می دارد ، در حالی که در واقعیت من حرف خود را حفظ می کنم
هنگامی که من نمی توانم توجیه نکنم که آن را حفظ نکنم - همانطور که در نظر می گیرم ، برای من مواظب است
آن اعتبار آن را می بینم: من وعده های خود را حفظ می کنم و به خودم رعایت می کنم
توافق نامه ها ، اما فقط تا زمانی که من توجیهی مهم را برای آن ببینم
شکستن آنها من بیشتر قوانین - به جز قراردادهای اجتماعی من - پیروی می کنم
برای برخی از قوانین که من توجیه نمی کنم: به عنوان مثال ، من نمی توانم
شخصاً تقلب در اظهارنامه مالیات بر درآمد من را توجیه می کنم ، اما من اغلب
توجیه بیش از حد سرعت. معضل اخلاقی کلاسیک -
اینکه آیا کسی به یک قاتل تبر "حقیقت" در مورد
موقعیت معدن معصوم او - می تواند به عنوان تنوع این امر دیده شود
همان نکته: من حقیقت را می گویم تا اینکه نتوانم آن را توجیه کنم. و با این حال من متوجه مقاومت خود در مورد پذیرش این موضوع در صورت وجود هستم
خیلی طاس اعتراض به جهش "صداقت" من به ذهن: این است
نه این که من بسته به آنچه در مورد آن احساس می کنم ، حرف خود را حفظ می کنم ، این است
که من همیشه حرف خود را حفظ می کنم به جز وقتی که برخی از آنها وجود دارد
دلیل نه اما - و اینجا نکته ای است که Erhard در حال رانندگی است
به سمت - این به سادگی همان "آنچه اتفاق افتاده" با
"داستان" متفاوت به آن؟ درست نیست که من یا خودم را حفظ می کنم
کلمه یا من نمی کنم ، و سپس یک داستان اضافه می کنم ، توجیه برخی
طبیعت برای هر اقدامی که انجام می دهم؟ "آنچه اتفاق افتاده است" نیست
بدون توجه به توضیح یا توجیه من بدون تغییر باقی بمانید
