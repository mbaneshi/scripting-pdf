SPEAKING BEING
FRED
And at dinner I got to what the cost is, because when I see all the happiness around here, I
just want to push it all down. And what I discovered about how I dominate is I don’t want you
to be happier than I am. So I come in with sad, and I really get sad and I get heavy with the
sadness. But what I also discovered was this incredible disempowerment just all the way down.
If I make a commitment and something happens like I don’t want to fulfi ll that, then I go into
sadness, and then I don’t want to do anything, like the whole bottom falls out. So any joy in my
relationship with my wife? Well I don’t want her to be quite that much happier than I am. I take
away all that joy...
ERHARD
Because if you don’t have sadness, and sadness is the way you dominate and avoid domination...
If you don’t have sadness you lose your weapon. You can’t be happy except tentatively. Just for a
little while maybe. Very good. Continue.
FRED
So also what I’ve looked at: I’ve been talking about having a television show for two years.
To have teenagers and parents interact in a powerful way to get over all this stuff  about clean
rooms. And whenever I get up to speed about that I get sad. And I don’t want to do that. I’m
avoiding the domination of being powerful and making that kind of contribution to the world.
ERHARD
That’s hard to hear—avoid the domination of being powerful. It’s hard to hear.
FRED
I don’t want that domination. I want to be free just in my relationship with my wife. I don’t
want to be dominated by my commitment to her. I want to be away from that. I’ve dominated
with anger, and with depression, and now with sadness.
KIPP
There’s no freedom in wanting to be free. It sounds free but it is the trap. Whatever you can’t be
with has you.
FRED
I found what this was all covering up. I just don’t accept myself. I don’t accept who I am. I have
a tremendous fear of just being with, being with who I am.
KIPP
Yeah but that tremendous fear is what comes with being a human being. You don’t make it up;
it makes you up.
ERHARD
I don’t like the term fear here. I’d like to be a little more precise. It’s really a threat in the form of
the domination. The fear is just a part of it. In other words, your emotional system is going to be
Forum Day Three: Session Four
271
consistent with what your racket is up to. So you’re going to have emotions appropriate to what
your racket is up to. If what your racket is up to is avoiding domination, for you Fred, given the
way you’ve got it structured, it’s going to produce a bit of fear. The fear is not the source of it.
The source of it is avoiding the domination of the responsibility for being powerful and able.
FRED
Thank you...
ERHARD
See if you weren’t frightened, you couldn’t justify avoiding. If you weren’t sad you wouldn’t
have a reason.
(to Kipp)
We didn’t deal with reasons yet have we?
KIPP
No.
ERHARD (jokingly)
Why are we so far behind?
KIPP
That’s one of my issues.
(laughter)
ERHARD
Comes up particularly around me, right? Otherwise he’s fi ne. Around me he’s got this issue.
(returning to the topic)
Very important to get this. I want to cut out this crap of explaining your life on the basis of the
way you feel... Fred is giving you the insight that the way you feel is a product of your racket,
not the other way around. You are not molded by your fear. Your fears are there merely to be
consistent with what your racket is up to, so you have got this kind of justifi cation. You are
not run by your emotions. That’s the apparency. Underneath that, what’s driving things is the
racket.
FRED
Part of what I was looking at was also the inauthenticity/authenticity issue. I had it all wired
that I was absolutely authentic. All I had to do was be around and I was authentic. And when I
could accept the fact that I am inauthentic, not like guilt, or like mortal sin, or like confession...
272
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Hold on. You want to get that. That conversation’s come up in here a lot of times and it’s still
not fl at. Being able to be what you’re afraid you might be gives you power.
FRED
So when I fi nally looked at that I actually had a tremendous feeling of real freedom. I really got
that I’m absolutely inauthentic, it’s just how I am, it’s like telling the truth for the fi rst time,
it gave me a whole playground where I could just be or express or create who I am. I had this
thing tied up with the God issue the lady had brought up before, that I was here on earth to be
the guardian of the playground...
(laughter)
But I couldn’t play. My job was to be this superior, arrogant person who is going to guard and
protect the playground, but I wasn’t going to get to play. But I can’t play. When I fi nally saw that
I’m inauthentic, it was almost a celebration. It’s great! I’m inauthentic. Now there’s a place to
start from to fi nd out who I really am.
ERHARD
Don’t misinterpret what Fred is saying. He means what he says but don’t listen to it wrong. He’s
saying, “embracing what you’re afraid you might be gives you power.” He didn’t say, “make
being inauthentic right.” He said he was able to embrace it. That he was able to be in the face of
it. Whatever you can be with lets you be. Whatever you can’t be with won’t let you be.
FRED
So it’s like a...
ERHARD
It’s almost starting to get clear in here. It’s like “yeah, yeah, I know that, why are you saying it
again?”
FRED
And so it’s like this whole new sense of freedom. You know before The Forum my wife was
telling me, “Fred, you don’t know who you are.” That made me furious. And the truth is I don’t
know who I am. And to be able to get that I’m inauthentic, that’s the most freedom I think I’ve
ever had.
KIPP
It is the most freedom you’ve ever had.
FRED
I was looking at the issue of the empty and meaningless. I’m not sure that I have that like I have
“inauthentic.” And I want to interact for a moment to get it...
“
might be gives you power.
Forum Day Three: Session Four
273
ERHARD
Hold on a second. You notice he didn’t say he was confused. You want to listen that he’s
saying the same things a lot of other people have said in here. Talking about not quite getting
something yet. But he’s talking about it, he has framed it, he’s construed it, he’s spoken it so that
there’s an opening for him to get it. Rather than a way that there is no opening for him to get it
so that Kipp has to beat him up to get him to get it.
FRED
So what I was looking at, the possibility that empty and meaningless, if we had the opposite
of that, if life was full and fulfi lling there would be no space for me to come up, to express
myself, to be fully blown as a human being, in the sense that I would be spending all my time
trying to fi nd out what’s the meaning of life if it’s already so full? I’m looking at empty and
meaninglessness as a place to start from like it’s empty, it’s open.
ERHARD
Here’s the problem in that. It’s one of the problems Kipp and I have in leading The Forum.
This empty and meaningless you’ve got to get just like it is. You can’t get it as a place to start.
If you’re getting it like a place to start you’re getting it in-order-to. You’ve got to kill hope.
Otherwise your life is going to be full of hopelessness. See the one thing that goes away with
hope... When you suff er the pain of getting rid of hope, the other thing that goes away with it
is “hopeless.” We’re going to get a little deeper into this business about empty and meaningless
and take a look at what the structure is. If it’s all empty and meaningless then how did all this
crap happen? Everyone’s seen enough crap to be clear about the amount of crap there is? We
don’t need to do more crap in here?
Erhard stopped to acknowledge a participant for how diff erent she looked from the fi rst day.
ERHARD (continuing)
In Fred’s straight talk about it, I want you to get that you’ve got to get it just to get it, not in-
order-to. See if there’s an iota of getting out of the trap in your getting it, you didn’t get it. You
gotta go through the despair, you gotta go through whatever emotion you have, or whatever
mood you’ve got about it. You’ve got to get it cleanly. You can’t get it knowing that there’s going
to be a way out, because the way out is the way in. See if you get it knowing there’s going to be a
way out, you didn’t get it because you got it in a way that’s going to keep you in. I had forgotten
who I was talking to over here in the last session, what I said, that the attempt to get out of the
trap... you know, what makes Californians silly is their attempt to get out of the trap, because
the attempt to get out of the trap is being in the trap. What it is to be in the trap is to try to get
out of the trap. You can’t get out if you try, because trying to get out is part of the trap. You read
the right books, and they tell you that. Okay, so you fi gure, I’m going to give up trying to get out
of the trap. Well, that’s part of the trap. See, you can’t get out if you try, because trying to get
out is being in the trap. And you can’t get out if you don’t try. There’s no getting out of the trap.
There’s no way to win this game; you can’t beat this one. You’ve got to be able to be in the trap.
Every one of those words was chosen very carefully. You should listen to them very rigorously.
Giving up, surrendering to the trap: won’t work. All that’ll do is leave you in the trap. Trying to
“
When you suff er the pain of getting rid of
hope, the other thing that goes away with
it is ‘hopeless.’
274
SPEAKING BEING
get out of the trap won’t work because the trap is constructed in such a way that the attempts to
get out are the very bars of the trap. That’s what keeps you in the trap. You can’t get out if you
try, and you can’t get out if you don’t try. You’ve got to be able to be in the trap. You know, you
can’t write that. That’s oral. If you read it, it sounds like I said you’ve got to be able to be in the
trap. No. I said you’ve got to be able to be in the trap. You’ve got to fi nd freedom in the ropes:
full, total, absolute freedom in the ropes. You’ve got to fi nd freedom in your asshole-ness. Find
freedom in the racket. Not avoiding the racket, not running the racket, not indulging yourself
in the racket. “Okay, I’ll just do my racket.” That’s trapped. You’ve just surrendered to it, given
up to the racket. Trying not to do your racket will just be a new racket, even if you succeed at it,
which you probably won’t. Very, very rarely do people succeed at not doing their racket, and if
you did succeed that would just be your new racket. Your new racket would be not doing your
racket. Lots of people around here like that. They’re Enlightened. You’re the kind of people who
fall in holes or get hit by busses. So, no in-order-to. It’s empty and meaningless. And it’s empty
and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless. It doesn’t mean anything that it doesn’t
mean anything. It just doesn’t mean anything and it doesn’t mean anything that it doesn’t mean
anything. And it isn’t going to work out. It isn’t going to work out because it already worked out.
You think it’s going to work out someday. The right woman is not going to come along someday,
the one who’s blonde and naked on a horse. You’re gonna be stuck with the one you got. You
aren’t going to make it. There’s no making it. And you got plenty of evidence for that already. A
lot of people in this room have a lot of making it already. There are no failures in here. We could
go down the street and fi nd people whose lives are desperate due to their failures. Everyone
in here is pretty successful in dealing with life. You’re pretty stupid, but you’re successful at
dealing with life. We’ve made it this far despite our stupidity. Evidence that the stupid do make
it... At any rate... So no cheating. You can’t cheat your way out of this. You’ve got to lose and
then be able to be.
FRED
It looks like... I don’t know if that’s as far as I can take it. That’s what is. Like there’s no
supporting, no stuff  around it.
ERHARD
Yeah. It’s called the existential moment of truth: naked and without any support. You’ve got to
be able to be there. You’ve got to be able to be with nothing underneath you. You won’t make it.
You won’t make it in The Forum. It’ll take years for you to get that. Fred and I have been working
together a long time, pretty intensively. He’s a real good guy. It’s hard to tell when he talks about
himself. You don’t get it all when you open it up. We’re opening it up in here. This is kindergarten.
But it’s started. This is an experience over which you will never get. You’ll hear me talking for
years. What you’ll never get over is knowing that you’ve got a choice. I know you don’t know
what choice means yet, but you’ll never get over that. No matter how fucked up you get, that
you’ll never get over. Still lots of work to do. And you’ll do it if you see it as a privilege to do that
work.  If you can’t see what an extraordinary opportunity it is to do this work, then you ought
to complete The Forum and get every ounce of value you can get out of it, and there’s plenty
of value there to get, and you ought to go on your merry way. That’s a fair deal. You paid for it.
You’re not obligated to do anything; you haven’t joined anything because there’s nothing to join.
“
Giving up, surrendering to the trap: won’t
work. All that’ll do is leave you in the trap.
Trying to get out of the trap won’t work
because the trap is constructed in such a
way that the attempts to get out are the
very bars of the trap. That’s what keeps
you in the trap. You can’t get out if you
try, and you can’t get out if you don’t try.
You’ve got to be able to be in the trap.
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day Three: Session Four
275
FRED
When I made out my list of items for doing The Forum, I put down twenty-six individual,
separate, items on the form I fi lled out for The Forum. And as I shared my detailed list with the
lady I spoke to when I registered, she was aghast. What is driving me in the direction of twenty-
six items that need to get handled otherwise my life isn’t... Where is the value in me standing up
here?
KIPP
Not in those twenty-six items.
FRED
Yeah, I got that far.
ERHARD
Who said there was any value? Who said there was supposed to be any value? Who said that life
was about value?
FRED
Um, that if I accomplish those things, then I would be of value.
ERHARD
No you wouldn’t. You’d be a guy walking around saying I accomplished those twenty-six things
and now I have value. Nothing wrong with that.
FRED
Yeah.
ERHARD
Who said that those things were of value, was you.
FRED
Yeah, I did.
ERHARD
He made that up. It’s okay with me that he made that up. But he’s not the Pope, and the Pope
doesn’t say that. He said that. The only problem with it is if he believes in it, if he believes
that it’s true. If he believes that he said that and that’s the game he’s playing, that’s wonderful.
You don’t have any value. You’re nothing. Nothing and bullshit. No value. And you’ve got a
mouth. And you can say, “I’ve got these twenty-six projects, twenty-six commitments, and
accomplishing them gives me value, because I said so.” Let me ask you a question. Is a ball
in a hole at one end of a fi eld more valuable than a ball on the top of a little stick at the other
end of the fi eld? Which is the more valuable condition? A ball in a hole? Or a ball on a stick?
A lot of people think that God said that balls in holes are better than balls on sticks. They’re
called golfers. They think that it is that way, and not that someone made it up... If you forget
276
SPEAKING BEING
that you say so, you do get nutty about it instead of having fun. So yeah, your twenty-six things:
wonderful as long as they belong to you.
FRED
I just had the thought standing up here, that if I have so many things going on then I can avoid
domination. Because I could always say “I’m too busy. I’ve got this meeting to go to so I can’t go
to this other meeting.”
ERHARD
Lots of people too busy to do anything. Who in here is too busy to do anything? “I don’t get to
accomplish anything because I’m too busy.”
FRED
I gave up the twenty-six items and I saw that there’s no satisfaction in them. I’m driven to them,
and there’s no sense of empowerment. So I’m actually looking at the wonder of complacency.
That it might be just wonderful to go home and watch TV, have a beer and forget about my
twenty-six items. There might be more authenticity in relaxing, watching TV with a beer than
scrambling after my twenty-six items.
ERHARD
Yeah, and neither one of them is going to get you anyplace.
(pausing)
And you’re actually going to do what you’re going to do anyhow, not what you contemplate
doing. You haven’t got much choice about it. In fact, none. You can only do what you do; you
can’t do what you don’t do. As soon as I fi nd someone who has done what they didn’t do, we’re
going to stop doing The Forum because it’ll be bullshit. So far, looking through half a million
people, we haven’t found anybody who did what they didn’t do. Everyone’s only done what
they did.
(to another participant sitting)
Get that? You ever do anything you didn’t do? You only do what you do, right?
PARTICIPANT
I do what I want to do.
ERHARD
You do what you want to do?
PARTICIPANT
Always.
ERHARD
Always?
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day Three: Session Four
277
(to another participant sitting next to the participant who said she does what she wants to do)
Sit on her lap, or hold her arms down, or something.
(the other participant sits on the fi rst participant’s lap)
Now: want to stand up.
(the participant cannot stand up)
So, you don’t always do what you want to do. And you don’t do what you like to do. You do what
you do. That’s all you ever do. You’ve always done what you did, and sometimes coincidentally,
from time to time it happens to be what you wanted to do.
PARTICIPANT
That’s nonsense.
ERHARD
It is nonsensical.
PARTICIPANT
Then why do The Forum?
ERHARD
That’s what I said. We’re going to stop doing The Forum as soon as I fi nd someone who did
something they didn’t do.
A participant named Kevin stood, who, during Erhard’s conversation with Jacob in the previous
session, had complained that the camera pointing at Jacob was also pointing at people in the “no-
video” section.
KEVIN
I came to The Forum very skeptical of the whole thing. My feeling was that I would probably
get something out of it. I was sure I was going to have to go through so much bullshit I wasn’t
sure I was going to last it out. As it turned out that was partially true, because I, like a bunch of
other people, I sense, I felt like we were being sold the next session at every opportunity. But at
this point in the game I’m willing to accept that too. It wasn’t as bad as I thought it was going
to be. I didn’t really start to get into this until yesterday, or maybe it was today. In searching for
my racket, I just couldn’t seem to fi nd my racket. But during the sharing, I had the feeling that
every single person who stood, everyone’s racket seemed to be my racket. I couldn’t believe it.
Today I guess I made a breakthrough.
WES
Hold on. I want to complete this stuff  about “I guess I had a breakthrough.” I don’t mean even
the “guess” part. Where are you looking to declare a breakthrough? Where does breakthrough
occur?
