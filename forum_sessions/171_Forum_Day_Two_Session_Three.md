Forum Day Two: Session Three

PARTICIPANT
Can you have more than one act?
ERHARD
Yes. I don’t say you won’t do your old number again. I just say you’re left with a possibility
beyond your old number. Being related is enormously risky. I don’t care what fairy-tale bullshit
you bought into. You’re going to get hurt being related.
(to the group)
There are no answers to being successfully related. And you, assholes, have been looking for the
answer to being successfully related. That’s why you’re assholes. There’s a way to be empowered
and enabled in the face of the risk that being related is. You can bring power and ability to the
risk. You can’t bring answers. There are no formulae, no ten easy steps. Okay. We need to do this
about three times.
Kipp now took the lead in the interactions with participants, but Erhard remained in the conversa-
tion, wandering around at the back of the room and sometimes taking over an interaction that Kipp
had begun.
ERHARD
See, you’re so thrown to the story that you tell the story about the racket, and that will nev-
er give you anything beyond your racket. That’s what the structure of the distinction racket
is for, to break up the story. You die without knowing who you are if you live your life for
approval.
(regarding one participant’s persistent back pain)
You think people are really built that badly?
PARTICIPANT
My racket is I’m scared of doing it wrong. That doesn’t sound right.
ERHARD
That’s a very frequent payoff—avoid the domination of being responsible for. That’s a very
childish concern, but that’s where your racket comes from. Kids’ rackets are avoiding the
domination of being responsible. You are going to be a little boy or little girl until you com-
plete your relationship with your parents. You are not going to grow up until you complete
your relationship with your parents. You are not going to get away with it. I happen to have
had a mother who never made a mistake... only one. I’ll tell you what that was later. This
is one that I know about deeply and profoundly. You are not ever going to make it until
your parents make it with you. No kidding. You just got to get off it with your parents. I’ve
spent most of my life engaged in this question about what it is to be human. What is it that
Moods are not accompanying phenomena;
rather, they are the sort of thing that deter-
mine Being-with-one-another in advance. It
seems as if, so to speak, a mood is in each case
already there, like an atmosphere, in which
we are steeped and by which we are thor-
oughly determined. It not only seems as if this
were so, it is so; and in light of these facts, it is
necessary to dispense with the psychology of
feelings and experiences and consciousness.
(Being in the World 171)
“
Observes Dreyfus: “Heidegger would no doubt appreciate the fact
that we ordinarily say we are in a mood, not that a mood is an
experience in us.”
Having participated in, and observed, a number of Forums, we
know from personal experience that the process can be seen as a
roller-coaster of mood shift s. Erhard tells the participants on the
first day that they should bring their current moods into The Fo-
rum with them, and not try to fix them; so the moods of the partici-
pants are of course at some level individual, though not subjective,
with each participant Being-in-his-or-her-own-world.
But in conjunction with our analysis of Being-with (in the
sidebar with that title in Session One of Day Two), and in light of
our own experience of The Forum, we raise this point about the
nature of social moods. We do so to contrast such moods with the
collective sense of aff inity that inevitably accompanies The Forum
transformation.
Heidegger’s distinction of the publicness of the they-self is
presented as an aspect of Dasein’s fleeing its authentic self. Public-
ness, in that context, characterizes the levelling-down of Dasein’s
possibilities to the average, in the service of its flight from authen-
ticity. We assert that the general mood in The Forum, through its
roller-coaster changes to its ebullient finish, is an aspect of what
it means for the authentic self to appropriate its own inauthentic-
ity, and it diverges greatly from the levelling down the publicness

SPEAKING BEING
makes you and me the way we are? The standard interpretation as to how you and I got to
be the way we are has no power. It gives me nothing to say about it. I can’t talk myself into
being. A lot of the lack of freedom is constituted in your relationship with your parents.
The single most important learning experience in my life was doing programs with teenag-
ers. The ten-day course for teenagers we used to do in the mountains—let me tell you what
I found out about teenagers. After ten days, you find out that the single most important
thing in your life is that you love your mother and father. And that’s no shit. And there’s
very little structure in a teenager’s life to express that. You’ve got to get that resolved, and if
you’re smart you’ll get it resolved tonight. We’ll let you out of here early enough to call your
mother, call your father.
(forcefully

You just gotta get off  it. You’re wasting your time and money in here if you’re going to stay on it
with your parents.
(in response to a question about what it means to be complete)
What I meant by being complete... your parents have got to be all right with you exactly the way
they are. Your parents don’t owe you a thing. They don’t owe you their love. You are not entitled
to your parents’ love. You owe them. I know, it’s a bitch. I don’t like it either. I don’t like gravity.
I don’t like being tied down. Gravity doesn’t care. It’s the way it is. Until you are complete with
your parents you can’t be yourself. Just loving them isn’t enough. You’ve got to be able to fully
be with your parents the way they are. You know, I spent most of my life tied to my mother’s
apron strings. And she had very long apron strings. I deserted my family. They didn’t know
where I was. Gone for years. I was still my mother’s little boy. I didn’t grow up till I was thirty
something.
Here Erhard acknowledged a nineteen-year-old participant who had shared about his relationship
with his parents for being complete with them at an early age.
ERHARD (continuing)
I don’t know if you can see it or not, but until that happens you aren’t anything but your moth-
er’s little boy.
Erhard left the room at this point, and Wes took the platform.

We’re now in the bonus category. This goes beyond The Forum. Look at your relationship with
your parents from the question: “Are they really all right with me?” What do you have to get off
with them? Being complete never leaves anybody with something dumped on them. Use the din-
ner break to complete with your parents.  Find a telephone. Reach them. If your parents are not
alive, fi nd someone with whom you are incomplete and complete with them. Is anybody unclear?
As Erhard returned to the room, Jane, a teenage participant, rose and spoke, her manner very shy
and serious.
of the they-self governs. As participants share and disclose their
stories, as they own up to and appropriate the ways they wound
up being (owning their “thrownness”—see the next sidebar), and
further, as they grasp and admit the harm that justifying these
ways of being has wrought: the “social mood” of profound aff inity
gets evoked. ■
