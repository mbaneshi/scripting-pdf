Forum Day Three: Session Four
299
My evidence is that your best and my best moments, my talents, the “what I’m good at,” the
“what I can be counted on”—including getting married, a good moment; having children,
raising children, a good moment; doing well in my job, a good moment: I’m talking about
the stuff ... I use to generate achievement. The exercise of that does not leave me full, whole,
complete, full of joy. It’s gratifying. God knows that whenever I have an accomplishment, I feel
great: a couple of moments, a couple of hours, a couple of days, a couple of weeks, maybe even
a year. But at some point I’m back to: that wasn’t enough.
SUZANNE
So where is the satisfaction?
ERHARD
The level of satisfaction is that there’s no full satisfaction. There’s no being complete with life.
One is always incomplete. It’s the conversation we had earlier about someday. See, someday,
someday I’m going to contribute enough, achieve enough, to have made it. No. Because
every accomplishment makes the context—there’s something wrong here—bigger, more
stronger, more valid, all that below the level of awareness. See up at the level of awareness I’m
developing myself and being a decent human being and making some sort of contribution,
and taking care of myself and taking care of the people around me. That’s all content, that’s all
foreground. The context, the background, which is reinforced by every achievement, is “there
is something wrong here.” What that leads to is never being satisfi ed. Ever. Never being full of
joy. Never. Never being complete never being whole. Life is always incomplete. And life is lived
as a struggle to be complete, to fi nally be satisfi ed. So that’s my evidence. It doesn’t prove what I
said, because you can’t prove an assertion. But it does validate it.
SUZANNE
So it’s best to assume that in anything we do we have that, we don’t get satisfi ed. There’s more. I
should assume that there should be more.
ERHARD
I’m not saying you should assume that, I’m saying we live like that. You and I and the other
eight hundred people sitting in this room and the other half a million people that I’ve
worked with.
SUZANNE
So that follows the logic that life is meaningless and empty, and therefore if life is meaningless
and empty, it is zero. Zero.
ERHARD
I don’t want to make the conclusion you made. Yes, what we are saying here is entirely
harmonic with that life is meaningless and empty. You see it got to be pretty clear that
everybody’s soap opera was bullshit, meaningless and empty, now I want to get it clear that the
rest of it is bullshit: the good parts. I want you to see where they come from. So that you get that
the whole thing is meaningless and empty. It’s not that I want it to be that way. It is that way.

SPEAKING BEING
SUZANNE
Yes. I get you.
ERHARD
Thank you very much.
(returning to The Forum leader who had shared about living life in order not to be embarrassed)
What did you say to get us started down this conversation with Suzanne? Is there anybody left
that doesn’t get that as you built the content called accomplishment and contribution, you are
reinforcing the context for that contribution, which context is “there’s something wrong.” Is
that clear for everybody?
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 8)
So I wouldn’t be so foolish as to ask how to get out of this predicament.
ERHARD
Yeah, because you don’t.
PARTICIPANT (Forum Leader 8)
I’m too smart I guess.
ERHARD
You see: What do you do about being dead?
(laughter)
Nothing. See it’s not a bad thing to know that you’re dead when you’re dead. You lie down.
You know that there are some dead people in the room? There are actually some dead people
in here–walking around bolt upright, dead though. There are people in here who have killed
themselves. They didn’t kill their bodies, they killed their selves. Their bodies walk around but
they are dead. There are dead people in here. You might even fi nd out that you were dead. That
would be good news because then you could lie down and relax.
(laughter)
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 9)
So one of the surprises for me in this Forum is that yesterday I saw that my racket is that I’m a
victim...
ERHARD
This is very surprising to hear from a guy like this. Very accomplished, very able guy.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 9)
And I’ve always disliked victims. So other than, so tonight for dinner, after the series of
meetings I ended up that there was nobody to go to dinner with, and the violins begin to come
