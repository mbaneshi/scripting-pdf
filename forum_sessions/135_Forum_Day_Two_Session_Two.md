Forum Day Two: Session Two

a lot minus one. Conceptually they’re diff erent, but conceptually the world is fl at. We’re talking
about the way the rug occurs for you. Similarly, we’re told that there are cultures, societies, in
which the number system goes up to seven.
(holding up eight fi ngers)
That would look like many.
(holding up nine fi ngers)
So would that.
(to the group)
You’ve got to get this, you see. This is one of those things you’ve got to get. Now we’re going to talk
about two... like t-w-o. Pretend you’re in a culture with no numbers at all. You’ve got only none,
one, and many.
(holding up two sheets of paper)r
If I said that was two, you’d say, “All right.”
(holding up two rulers)
If I said that’s two, you’d say, “okay.”
He continued, holding up two erasers, then two fi ngers, each time responding with increasing cer-
tainty as the imaginary tribesperson—until he held up one ruler
and one eraser.
ERHARD (continuing)
Can you see that you’d say, “I don’t know”? Two diff erent things would not occur for you as
t
“two.” However, after a few examples of diff erent things as two, you would eventually get that.
(holding up two things in one hand and one thing in the other)r
A new level to get, which would again require demonstration by examples. Then another new
level.
(holding up one fi nger)r
A set and an empty set. You’d never get this as two. No set of examples, however large, ever
distinguishes two. It only describes or defi nes two. You can’t invent new twos when you’ve just
got a defi nition of two. When you distinguish two, what you do is create a realm of possibility
in which things can occur, arise, as two. You can’t ever invent without a distinction. Defi nitions
limit, distinctions open up. What you are doing when you are distinguishing is creating, open-
ing up a context in which what you are distinguishing can occur, can happen. Is that starting
to get clear? What you’re doing now is very diff erent. You are distinguishing distinction. That’s a
little bit like putting your hands underneath your feet and lifting yourself up.

How would you distinguish two?
THINKING
The kind of thinking that Martin Heidegger was distinguishing in
his writing has not been available for human beings. We can’t think
this way because this way of thinking has not yet been thought
as a possibility, and therefore it is none of the things which
already-thought ideas always are: understandable, consistent
within themselves, or consistent with our other thoughts. It is not
yet already-available for assertion or evaluation. It must first be
unconcealed.
Heidegger’s first step in bringing forth this unthought think-
ing is to distinguish our current thinking as “our current thinking”
rather than simply as “thinking.” Essential to an inquiry into the
possibility of thinking, Heidegger says, is an inquiry into what
thinking is for us now: what we presently think about thinking,
what we presently define as thinking, and—since our thinking
gives us our being—what we are that thinking is (WCT 17). We must
T
begin to think the diff erence between the possibility of thinking
and whatever it is that we are doing now in the name of thinking,
so that the diff erence becomes the opening for the possibility. The
development of this distinction—a new way of thinking—is central
to Werner Erhard’s work, as it is to Heidegger’s; therefore we will
mention here several of the ways in which Heidegger characterizes
the thinking he is attempting.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
We’ll get to that. Here’s what I want you to get fi rst. Distinguishing establishes a domain of possi-
bility, is making possible, not giving form to, but making form possible; very important to get that
diff erence. Be in this conversation: distinction or distinguishing is an operation unlike defi ning, ex-
plaining. It does not lead to understanding. You do not understand two when you have distinguished
two. Distinction is an action which leads to power, because it creates possibility, which is freedom.

What is the diff erence between occurring and distinguishing?
ERHARD
Occurring happens in a realm distinguished. There are cultures in which, we are told, if you
show people a photographic image they don’t see it. These people, by the way, survive an
environment you would die in, so they’re probably not stupid. There’s no image on the paper
or in your brain. These cultures have never generated the possibility “photographic image,”
and so they see splotches on the paper. If you explain it to them, they don’t see an image but a
representation of an image. Where does the image happen? It happens in the distinction “pho-
tographic image.” In that domain of possibility arises “photographic image.”

I would like you to tease this out for me a bit more. Using the example, when you’re distin-
guishing two with any objects, and then it now occurs as two. So when you give me examples of
that, the occurrence now is determining how it occurs for me.
ERHARD
No. The defi nition is determining its occurring.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader

So it’s a concept.
ERHARD
Yeah. And what you get is a conceptually driven occurring. And isn’t that the way you learned
mathematics? You weren’t creative or generative in mathematics. Mathematicians learn math at
the level of distinctions, not at the level of defi nition. Consequently, they invent numbers. They
are not limited by arithmetic; they are freed by arithmetic, because arithmetic is constituted
by distinctions not by defi nitions. Arithmetic is not conceptual for them. Art is conceptual for
most people. Artists don’t generate art conceptually. If they do, that’s not art. That’s handicraft,
not art. You can’t create out of concepts, defi nitions. Dancers don’t dance out of explanations of
dance. They generate it out of a domain of possibility in which they can invent forms. What’s
present when a dancer is dancing is an occurring allowed by the possibility, not an occurring
allowed by the conception. You start doing the same thing over and over again when your art is
reduced to a concept. That’s painting by the numbers.
Fundamentally, this thinking is a response to an appeal. The
appeal arises from the wavering in appearance of Being, from its
tendency in the act of appearing to disappear. “Nature loves to
hide,” says the common translation of a fragment of Heraclitus,
the pre-Socratic Greek thinker (Wheelwright 70), which Heidegger
retranslates to emphasize his reading of physis (pronounced foo’-
sis): “Being (emerging appearance) intrinsically inclines toward
self-concealment” (IM 126). Thus the essential—Being, that which
must be thought—turns away. Being withdraws. And although
Heidegger acknowledges that for contemporary humans this with-
drawal is now almost unnoticed, nevertheless as beings, we are.
Therefore at some level we are always turned toward that missing
aspect of our existence:
What withdraws from us, draws us along by its
very withdrawal, whether or not we become
aware of it immediately, or at all. Once we are
drawn into the withdrawal, we are drawing
toward what draws, attracts us by its with-
drawal. And once we, being so attracted, are
drawing toward what draws us, our essential
nature already bears the stamp of “drawing
toward.” (WCT 9)
“
This is the exigence in the background of our lives. We are drawn
toward the ongoing concealment of Being, and in being so drawn
we find ourselves pointing in its direction: “We are who we are by
pointing in that direction—not like an incidental adjunct but as . . .
an essential and therefore constant pointing toward what with-
draws” (WCT 9, emphasis added).
T
The way to draw toward that which withdraws is through
y
thinking, since “Being in general gets interpreted on the basis of
thinking” (IM 129), but not in the ordinary way we understand
thinking. To think is “to lend a hand to the essence, the coming to
presence, of Being” (“TT” in QCT 40). When we are thinking we are
T
looking and drawing toward what withdraws: “Whenever man is
properly drawing that way, he is thinking—even though he may
still be far away from what withdraws, even though the withdrawal
