Forum Day Three: Session One

SUSAN
That’s right. I’m afraid I’m not going to fi nd the right position. I told him about my racket, that
“I’m right only when it matters to you that you’re right. It doesn’t matter if either way is okay.
But if you’re adamant about being right, then I want to be right.”
KIPP
It’s called new love. It’s a new marriage.
SUSAN
Anyway. Very diffi  cult for me.
KIPP
But that’s the important part. How diffi  cult it is. Everything that you call yourself is going to
fi ght against it. Every justifi cation in the world is going to be there to shut up.
SUSAN
I was afraid that I would lose footing.
KIPP
That’s right. Marriage isn’t about loving, about being at risk: it’s about dominating and winning.
SUSAN
I thought I didn’t want to dominate. I just didn’t want to be dominated.
ERHARD (entering the conversation)
Thanks for this Susan. Very useful conversation. Dominating and avoiding domination are two
sides of the same mirror. It doesn’t mean be a patsy either. There’s an alternative to dominating and
avoiding domination. There’s a possibility beyond that. And it’s not possible to see that until you
see what it costs you to dominate or avoid domination. Most marriages are about dominating and
avoiding domination. They’re about being right and avoiding being wrong. That’s what marriages
are really about. They’re not about the stuff  they put in the fairy tales. And they’re always going to
be about that because you and I didn’t make that up, we inherited that when we became human
beings. And it’s only to the degree that you can own that, for there to be a possibility beyond that.
What you’re doing now, looking at that and owning that, taking it on and seeing that that’s what
owns your marriage: that starts to create the possibility of some power in the marriage.
(pausing)
The other thing is, you want to be able to get to the point where you can be with what people
say. Otherwise you’re going to be manipulated by what people say. See, whatever your husband
said about The Forum: stupid. But you couldn’t be with it; it took your being away from you.
SUSAN
He used a lot of the terminology that you used, and that drove me nuts because he acted kind of
smug. You know he had found “it.” I hadn’t, so I had to go get “it.”

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Yes. That’s the smell of enlightenment. You want to keep your enlightenment to yourself and
not let the smell out. What you want to share with people is empowerment, not enlightenment.
You want to watch doing enlightenment with people, and it’s possible to empower people.
If someone says something stupid to you—I’m not telling you how to handle this, I’m just
illustrating that there’s a way to be with it—if somebody says something stupid to you, you can
say, “okay, I understand exactly what you’re saying.” That gives you much more of an opening
than “that’s stupid.” I don’t talk like this outside of here. I don’t use all this jargon outside of
here. I use it in here because there’s a reason to. Now, you’re going to be stupid. You’re going
to use all the terminology inappropriately. And there’s not much you can do about it. It’s hard
not to. If we could take it back before you left here, we would, so you would just be left with
yourself. All this stuff  in here is not signifi cant. The only thing signifi cant is you. And you can
work your way through those things with your husband now that you’re hip to what’s going
on. It’s a pretty exciting thing to think about the possibility of marriage beyond the games in
marriages.
KIPP
So in sharing with your husband last night, you said?
SUSAN
I said “I’m sorry I was such a twit about signing up.”
ERHARD
A twit?
SUSAN
It’s softer language for me.
ERHARD
You cleaned it up for television.
KIPP
And he said?
SUSAN
He said “That’s all right, I love you.”
KIPP
And what was left? What were you then standing in?
SUSAN
Standing in my own decision.
“
If we could take it back before you left
here, we would, so you would just be left
with yourself. All this stuff  in here is not
significant. The only thing significant
is you.
