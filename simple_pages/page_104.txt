SPEAKING BEING
MAC
So you’re not going to do anything about it.
WES
No, we’re not going to follow your suggestion.
MAC
Well at least I got it off  my chest.
WES
There’s something at stake here which is much more important than an hour or so of sleep.
MAC
For some of us, sleep is important to function.
WES
Yeah, yeah, it’ll get worse.

Who can repeat the assignments?
(some raising their hands)
Who cannot repeat them?
(others raising their hands)
Now, who can repeat the assignment and share about it?
SIENNA
Share your experience with someone in The Forum. Bring areas to work on, inauthenticities.
And look at areas of your life where looking good uses you.
WES
Look at the possibility that looking good has used your life. Which one do you want to share 
about?
SIENNA
I want to share about looking good, and the way I look good goes back to the already always
listening. I have a presence that is an act about knowing, about knowing it all.
WES
Without this distinction you are dealing with, we tend to put our knowledge and our informa-
tion in a box, and we don’t see that we use that box for something, we make the box itself right,
NOTE: See the beginning of Session Three of Day Four,
where Mac comes forward to share what he had gotten out
of the course.
