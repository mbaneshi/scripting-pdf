Forum Day Four: Session Two

WES
You’ve gotta have something be wrong.
DONALD
It’s fun to be stuck in “I’m fat and my mother...” There’s more juice in the being stuck than in
just going ahead and losing weight. What’s that about?
WES
It’s called “racket.” That’s what it’s about.
DONALD
Okay, so I’ve got a racket.
WES
You are a racket. And your whole “fat” story is part of your racket. All your problems about
“fat” are part of your racket, and all your solutions to those problems are part of the racket. And
all your not-solutions to those problems are part of the racket...
DONALD
If it’s a racket then there’s some payoff  holding it in place.
WES
Absolutely.
DONALD
I thought it happened the other way around. The costs... I got the costs... There’s some payoff  in
holding onto my little problem here. So I’ve got some payoff ...
WES
You want to be looking at what Donald is looking at: your problems and their relationships to
your racket, and your payoff s and your costs. That’s what the conversation—that’s what makes
the diff erence in the conversation; that’s what you want to be looking at. There should be an
opening into the problems that compose your life. Now—”That harmonizes with the rest of The
Forum?”—that’s what you want to be looking at.
DONALD
So I’ve got a racket called—I have, I’ve manufactured, I’ve created a racket called “I’m fat and
I want to lose weight,” right? This is a racket. I can see the costs. The costs are real clear: it’s
health, it’s aliveness, vitality.
WES
No your racket is, “I want to lose weight but I can’t.”

SPEAKING BEING
DONALD
Right, okay. That’s it.
WES
“And my mother’s the one who did it to me.” Was it your mother?
DONALD
Yeah. As a matter of fact.
(laughter)r
WES
You love to make your mother wrong! You really do. He can do it on a daily basis. He can live
now... Here’s how he solved the problem of how to make his mother wrong on a continual basis.
He has a problem with his weight. So every time he looks in the mirror his mother’s wrong.
Think about how accessible that is to him now. He doesn’t even need to call her up on the
phone. It’s just: Look in the mirror. That’s the payoff . Making her wrong is the payoff . You love
it. People love to make people wrong. There’s nothing like it: It’s the spice of life.
DONALD
Wes, I saw some people in New York a couple of weeks ago and they said, “Donald, you’ve
gained a lot of weight since moving to California.” I said “well, the relationship I moved out
here for didn’t work out.”
WES
Oh, so you made that relationship wrong.
DONALD
Got it.
WES (to the group)
Donald is learning something. His mother was the teacher—no, his need to make his mother
wrong is the teacher. He can make people wrong by gaining weight. It works every time. And
they did it to him. And they’re creeps, just like his mother, the original weight giver.
(laughter)r
By the way, your problems are like that. They repeat themselves. They’re repetitive in nature. So
that’s an insight.
DONALD
My mother...
