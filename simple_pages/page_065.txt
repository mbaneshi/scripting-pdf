Forum Day One: Session Two
51
ERHARD
The point is, to present your self in one way and be another way is inauthentic.
PAUL
Yeah, that’s true.
ERHARD
That’s what I said from the beginning. It’s like I said one and one is two, and then you say,
“Well, not always...”
PAUL
But that doesn’t account for intention. There are some things within one person’s realm of con-
trol and other things that aren’t.
ERHARD
You’re nutty about this too. 
(pointing to Jake)
I want you to listen here. We’ll get this now. I don’t know if he’ll get it, but you’ll get it.
PAUL
I’m trying to clarify the distinction.
ERHARD
Hold on. I understand. See, look: I didn’t say anything about intention. You brought that up, 
actually it was Jake, but in this conversation, you brought that up. 
PAUL
Yes.
ERHARD
I said that “inauthentic” was to present yourself in one way, and be another way. That’s pretty 
goddamn simple, isn’t it?
PAUL
Sure, yeah.
ERHARD
And is that inauthentic?
