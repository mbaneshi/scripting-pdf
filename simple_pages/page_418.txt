SPEAKING BEING
WES
Like the people over there who’ve really got it made have less problems than you do.
DONALD
But... they do.
(laughter)r
WES
No, they don’t. I promise you they don’t. They have more problems than you.
DONALD
So it’s something like the relationship with the problems?
WES
Yeah. They are able to relate to problems as part of the game.
DONALD
Instead of that it shouldn’t be.
WES
Exactly.
DONALD
Oh, I got it. Earlier someone said that problems are a declaration. You said no. But they are a
declaration...
WES
We’re a little ahead of ourselves. “In life there are problems” is ultimately a declaration. And 
“In life, problems shouldn’t be” is ultimately a declaration.
DONALD
We just don’t know that.
WES
Right.
DONALD
So, would the declaration that problems show up in be a complaint declaration?
WES
Yeah.
