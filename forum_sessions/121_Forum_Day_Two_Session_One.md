Forum Day Two: Session One

MARSHA
That’s when I changed my name to Marsha. I wouldn’t answer to that other name any more.
And by the time I got to high school, there was a new group. The act was down great. It worked.
I was class vice president. I became popular on a diff erent...
ERHARD
Not quite right, though, still popular; popular enough to avoid being unpopular. Your identity
got built when the issue was popularity.
(to the group)
You got put together for the purpose of dealing with issues like popularity.
MARSHA
As years went by, I got it down good that I won homecoming queen in college; student body
president; president of the sorority: everything.
ERHARD
She’s now one of those kids you couldn’t be that you thought had it all together. She was the
popular kids: the in-crowd; the one who whispered behind your back. These were the people
who were really happy, not like you.
Erhard stopped to address a participant sitting down, who remained seated, without a microphone,
and who shook her head in response to each of Erhard’s questions.
ERHARD (continuing)
Is this hitting close to home? Popularity wasn’t your thing? What did you care? You have a chip
on your shoulder? If I asked your friends if you had a chip on your shoulder, what would they
tell me? I know you can’t think for them, but what do you think they would say? Think about it.
I’ll be back.
(laughter; to Marsha)
You were saying?
MARSHA
I’ve got six children, a wonderful husband: I arrange everything.
ERHARD
You generate the family. You source the family.
MARSHA
But I am so thin and my body can’t do it anymore.
THE THEY-SELF
Throughout his work, Werner Erhard has proposed that the fun-
damental purpose for human beings in our current Cartesian
paradigm—their design function—is the survival of the self; and
that just as survival for a biological organism requires food and water,

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Listen carefully. What Marsha’s telling you doesn’t belong to her. That bullshit is all over the
place. It’s a rainstorm. It’s all over the place: that bullshit about being stretched too thin. You
ain’t ever going to be big enough to operate in a way that doesn’t leave you unnurtured and too
thin. You’re going to die disappointed, because you aren’t ever going to accomplish enough to be
fulfi lled when accomplishment is there in-order-to. All you’re doing is building dissatisfaction that
accomplishment is designed to avoid. It looks like a big pile of satisfaction. I mean, here’s a wom-
an who was successful as an older child; successful in college. Extraordinarily successful raising
six children, married to a great guy: and it’s making her “thin.” It makes you thin when those
accomplishments are in-order-to. It ought to be making her “thicker” not “thinner.” They make
you thinner when they’re not fulfi lling, when they’re not enlivening, when they’re a strategy.
(to Marsha)
What else?
MARSHA
Here I am today.
ERHARD
You’re in the right place.
(applause)
You aren’t going to be around that much honesty for the most part. What you and I did yes-
terday was put together a structure in which it is possible to be honest. You need to develop a
language for honesty. You can’t be honest in everyday language. It’s not designed for honesty.
You and I have been building a structure of distinctions designed for honesty. So you and I have
been building a language, a set of distinctions, building a structure where it is possible to be
honest. You’ve got to be a big person to be authentic about your inauthenticity. Being authentic
about your inauthenticity gives you being big. There’s no “big” inside of Marsha. No qualities
in there. What you and I describe as “qualities” arise in the moment of action. Someone who is
authentic about their own inauthenticity is giving themselves being big. Is that clear to you?
(returning to participant who remained seated without a mic)
There are no big people in here, because people are neither big nor small. They’re just people.
And when you’re authentic about your inauthenticity, it gives you being big. If she already had
the quality in there, that would be like being tall. If big were inside us, there wouldn’t be any-
thing very interesting about that, would there? Big arises in the acting. On the common sense
view, what would it occur to you to do with your inauthenticity? Hide it. Stamp it out. Change
it. Fix it. Repair it. The way you already always are about your inauthenticity is something
across the spectrum from fi x it, not-be-it, shove it down, across the spectrum to hide it. The idea
to share it would never occur to you. The idea to dump it on others might occur to you because
of the idea you’ve got called “friends.” It’s pure crap, what you tell your friends, pure crap. Be-
cause what do you tell your friends? The story. They have no respect for you so they sympathize
with you. They think you’re crap, just the same as you do, and that’s sad. And the appropriate
for an ontological entity, such as a human identity, the essential
survival requirements are being right and looking good, which
together justify and maintain whatever way we wound up being.
Both of these elements are addressed here during the second
day of The Forum. Being right is proposed as one of the primary
payoff s in the structure of a racket; and the discussion of looking
good grows out of the assignment given at the end of the first day,
when participants were told to locate the places in their life where
they were being “used by looking good.” Both of these distinctions
are essential elements of the model Erhard is creating in order to
deconstruct our Cartesian understanding and reveal the clearing
for a new possibility of being human.
Heidegger has likewise proposed a structure for understand-
ing human Being (Dasein) in terms of its domination by a concern
for the opinions of others. His rubric for this structure is das Man.
In the standard translation of Being and Time, this phrase is ren-
dered as the “they,” and here Heidegger describes the situation:
“
[Dasein] itself is not; its Being has been taken
away by the Others. . . . These Others, more-
over, are not definite Others. On the contrary,
any Other can represent them. What is de-
cisive is just that inconspicuous domination
by Others which has already been taken over
unawares from Dasein as Being-with. . . . The
“who” is not this one, not that one, not one-
self, not some people, and not the sum of them
all. The ‘who’ is the neuter, the “they.y ” (BT 164)
Hubert Dreyfus proposes that to translate das Man in this way
suggests that I am to be distinguished from them. But the point is
that the “they” has taken me over, so that in being dominated by
the “they” I am one of them. Therefore Dreyfus prefers the trans-
lation “the One”; that is, we don’t conform to the norms because
“they” do it, but because “it’s what one does” (BITW 151–152).
W
Says Heidegger: “In this inconspicuousness and unascertainability,
the real dictatorship of the ‘they’ is unfolded” (BT 164). As a result,
T
Dasein loses itself in the ways of Being of the “they,” and the Self of
everyday Dasein becomes the they-self.
