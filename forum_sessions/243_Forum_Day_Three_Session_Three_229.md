Forum Day Three: Session Three 229
ERHARD
I got over being upset. It not only doesn’t mean anything...
(pausing)
Listen. Life is not only empty and meaningless, but it is empty and meaningless that it is empty
and meaningless. See, some asshole in here is going to say, “Well, if it’s empty and meaningless
then I’m going home.”
(loudly)
No! You made it mean something! You didn’t get it. It’s empty and meaningless and it’s empty
and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless. Life’s not going anywhere. It’s like this. You
don’t like this? Too bad. This is the way it is. Just like this, and that, and that. Tomorrow will be
like it is tomorrow, and the day after will be like it is the day after tomorrow. And a year from
now will be like it is a year from now: like it is today. A lot of you are hearing me insulting
your practice. You know, insulting your practice, let’s call it, your relationship with God, your
meditation, whatever it is. I’m not insulting your practice. I’m insulting practicing in-order-to.
You practice when you practice. Shut up. Just practice. It’s not going to get you anywhere. If
you’re practicing in order to get somewhere, stop it because you’re wasting your time. You’re
not going to get anywhere. You’re always going to be right where you are. If you practice long
enough, you’ll fi nd that out. Talk to Kipp some more, you’re doing a good job.
KIPP
Now what?
ANGEL
That’s a very good question.
ERHARD
Very good...
ANGEL
I like the fact that...
ERHARD
Remember when I said that you thought your fi re would go out if you didn’t have this drama?
ANGEL
Right.
ERHARD
Yes.
ANGEL
But I got fi re from the possibility of having an empty canvas.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
I know. You turned that into another fi re: drama, meaning, signifi cance. You take everything
and turn it into shit. We create something called possibility and you turn it into some kind of
fucking golden calf. Like “oh! That’s going to save me. Man, am I glad I got here! I didn’t know
that was the answer.” The answer is that there isn’t any answer. That’s the answer. No kidding.
Like really. You can go anywhere in the universe you want to go to get the answer. And that’s
the answer. Whatever it is you’re doing to make it, you’re never going to do that enough to make
it. It isn’t going to turn out because it already turned out. And this is the way it turned out. Just
like this. Tomorrow will be just like it is tomorrow. And when you die, they’ll put you into a box
and throw dirt on your face. And that’s how it’ll all turn out. It doesn’t mean anything.
ANGEL
So now that I know that, why not throw dirt in my face right now?
ERHARD
That’s making it mean something. And it’s high drama meaning. You could have said, “I’ll go
watch television.” You could have said that but it’s not dramatic enough. There are people in
here that are not high dramatists like you are. Some people say “I’ll go home and watch the
game.” Yours is “I’ll kill myself.” It’s just a matter of style. You watch. The world’s going to
change here. It’s going to stop being the way it is.
KIPP
What now? Can you see how attached you are to having it mean something?
ANGEL
Yes. Yesterday I was attached to caring which meant it means something.
KIPP
Yeah, and so what you’re attached to is being attached.
ERHARD
That’s a little advanced for most of you.
ANGEL
So, if I’m not attached to it anymore, it doesn’t mean it’s not still there. It just means I’m not
attached to it anymore.
ERHARD
No. That’s some kind of Zen horseshit. You are not attached to it. You’re not attached to it, and
that’s the end of that story.
ANGEL
If I’m not resisting it, then I’m not attached to it anymore.
Speaking out
Another aspect of this perspective: in speaking out, we are
“outing” something that has already existed, in the background,
as a possibility. Indeed: “If we conceive of this state of aff airs in an
elementary and originary way, we see that what is spoken out is
already necessarily within physis, otherwise it could not be spoken
from out of it” (FCM 26). Heidegger presses the point: everything
that exists has been spoken out, and everything that has been
spoken out was already there. So:
The question for us is: What does this legein,
this speaking out accomplish? What occurs in
the logos? Is it only a matter of the fact that
what beings as a whole are is brought to a
word, formulated, come to word? To come to
word—what does that mean? (FCM 26–27)
“
To understand the meaning of a term or concept, says Heidegger,
it may be useful to consider its opposite. He finds in a fragment of
Heraclitus the suggestion that the opposite of legein—that is, “not
letting come to word”—was for the Greeks precisely understood as
concealment:
From this it necessarily follows that the funda-
mental function of legein is to take whatever
prevails from concealment. . . . Revealing, ‘tak-
ing from concealment,’ is that happening which
occurs in the logos. In the logos, the prevailing
of beings becomes revealed, becomes mani-
fest. (FCM 27)
