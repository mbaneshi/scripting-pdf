Forum Day Three: Session Three 227
KIPP
Yesterday you saw something about not caring.
ANGEL
I saw that it was okay to care sometimes and sometimes I don’t.
KIPP
Right.
ANGEL
It’s not okay to have life mean something sometimes and for sometimes life not to mean
anything.
ERHARD
It never means anything. It doesn’t mean something sometimes and not mean something at
other times. Life is empty and meaningless.
ANGEL
Then why should I be alive? Then I shouldn’t be alive. Dead.
KIPP
Then you would be dead.
ERHARD
You know what you just did? I said life is empty and meaningless and you made that mean
something. I said life was empty and meaningless and you got sad about it. “Really? Ohh. We’ll
maybe I’ll just lie down now and watch television.”
ANGEL
And so just because you say life is meaningless I should believe it?
ERHARD
I didn’t say to believe anything. Didn’t I tell you up front not to believe anything I say?
ANGEL
Yes, I forgot.
ERHARD
The truth speaks for itself, it does not need me. At any rate, when I said “empty and
meaningless,” you said, “oh my God, oh that’s terrible.” You made empty and meaningless
mean something. You’re a drama queen.
ANGEL (vehemently)
Yes, I am.
Man, insofar as he exists as man, has always
already spoken out about physis [Being],
about the prevailing whole to which he himself
belongs. Man has done so not only through
the fact and for the purpose of talking specifi-
cally about things; for to exist as man already
means: to make whatever prevails come to be
spoken out. (FCM 26, emphasis added)
“
In order to be spoken about, beings must be spoken out. For the
Greeks, “speaking is called legein; the prevailing that has been
spoken out is the logos” (FCM 26). But Heidegger suggests a more
original meaning for both words: legein, in its original meaning, was
not to speak, but to gather and collect, or to lay out; Logos, as what
is gathered and laid before us, was the primary gathering principle.
This “original” meaning of logos, then, draws our attention to
whatever is there before it is articulated—before the emergence
of judgment, the assertion of opinion, and the contradiction of
perspectives. These are all of course inevitable. But the writing
of the pre-Socratics suggests to Heidegger that at the dawn of
humanity, something was available to human apprehension, a
logos, which now escapes us.
For Heraclitus, it was the logos, the background of collected-
ness, the sway in the event of its emergence into the world. The
meaninglessness from which beings emerge cannot maintain
itself in a world of meaning, but for a moment in history, for those
who were open to its emergence, it was glimpsed. Heraclitus
suggests that it remains available, but that human beings as a
whole—the hoi polloi—are unavailable for glimpsing it.
But while logos constantly remains itself,
human beings behave as those who do not
comprehend (axunetoi), both before they have
heard and aft er they have heard. . . . Hence one
must follow the Together in beings—that is,
adhere to it; but whereas logos essentially un-
folds as this Together in beings, the mass lives
as if each had his own understanding (sense).
(Heraclitus, fragments 1–2, in IM 140–141)

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
All right. And proud of it.
ANGEL
And sometimes I’m not.
ERHARD
Where is the chip queen? I’m going to get you two together. You can have a meeting. That
would be great. Talk about movies. That’s real entertainment: the drama queen and the chip
queen together. Angel, do you understand that I’m not trying to make you not be the way you
are? I’m simply trying to shed some light where you stand. I don’t want you to not be the way
you are. I know you’re a drama queen. You’re always going to be into the drama. And I didn’t
say that’s bad. But you want to make everything mean something. You screw yourself over every
time because you make it mean something.
ANGEL
Isn’t it human to make everything mean something?
ERHARD
That’s what I said. We were going to reveal the already always nature of being for human beings.
ANGEL
So what I got was that I am a human being and I can’t get away from being a human being. And
I spent a lot of time and eff ort trying not to be a human being.
ERHARD
Very good, but now you’ve turned that into a sacred cow. You’ve turned being a human being
into a sacred cow. “Now the son of a bitch wants to take away my new sacred cow from me.”
ANGEL
And my new sacred cow is being a human being.
ERHARD
Yeah, you turned that into some kind of a story. Instead of just being a human being you turned
that into a soap opera, a drama. Life doesn’t mean anything, sweatheart. It doesn’t mean a thing.
ANGEL
You don’t know how upset that makes me.
ERHARD
I understand that it makes you upset. I told you, this is my second Forum. I told you when I
found that out I was real upset.
ANGEL
But then what did you do with it?
Heidegger develops this distinction further:
Heraclitus wants to say: human beings do hear,
and they hear words, but in this hearing they
cannot “hearken” to, that is, follow, what is
not audible like words, what is not talk but
logos. . . . But genuine hearkening has nothing
to do with the ear and the glib tongue, but
instead means obediently following what logos
is: the gatheredness of beings themselves.
(IM 142–143)
“
Logos, Being, the Together in beings, is the unspoken background
that emerges to be glimpsed in the dialogue of The Forum.
If we are listening for the logos, we may hear the gathering in
Heidegger’s words of one of his most important and provocative
hints: his persistent play at the fuzzy boundary between Being
and beings. By teasing out, over a fift y-year career, the question
of agency in the Being–being relation, Heidegger provided human
thinking with an essentially reflexive quandary, one whose
thinking through may catapult us into a leap and land us with a
more liberated understanding of the world.
Heidegger’s early take on this question, in Being and Time,
was that Dasein achieves an authentic existence through the
achievement of resoluteness, and the existential choices thereby
made available. One of those choices is to stop fleeing one’s reality
and let it be, recognizing that its meanings are made up and
malleable: “When Dasein is resolute, it takes over authentically
in its existence the fact that it is the null basis of its own nullity”
(BT 354). In The Forum, this authentic taking-over of existence
is made possible by the distinction of nullity (life is empty and
meaningless), and of oneself as the null basis of that nullity (it’s
empty and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless).
In his later rubrics, releasement and appropriation, Heidegger
moved toward the more receptive side of the Being–being balance,
bringing letting and allowing forward as moments in the attainment
of authenticity. But the clearing opened through all of these
articulations is the Same, emerging in the unspoken reverberations
as the distinction is teased out. “Hints,” said Heidegger, “need the
widest sphere in which to swing” (“DL” in OWL 27). ■
