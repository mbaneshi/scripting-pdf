KIPP
As long as you’ve got some way you think it should be, that means it means something. And as 
long as it means something, that meaning has you.
DON
Exactly.
KIPP
Thank you.
(Applause)
SANFORD
I would like to share where I’m at right now and I’m just being.
KIPP
Great! Just being.
SANFORD
Yeah.
KIPP
And the only time you’re being is when?
SANFORD
Right now.
KIPP
When you’re being. And the only time I’m going to catch you not being is when? When you’re 
not being.
SANFORD
Yeah.
KIPP
Thank you very much. Fred?
FRED
I fi nally got down to my big racket of rackets and that’s being sad.
ERHARD
Listen up here. You may not be sad; you may be something else. What you always are or often 
are, that you don’t want to be? That’s a racket.
