Forum Day Three: Session Four 
281
ERHARD
Kevin, what was the last thing you just said?
KEVIN
I’m afraid to repeat anything I said you might have found interesting.
(laughter)
No, I said “At that point it leaves my mind blank.”
ERHARD
Got it.
WES
Let me give you some way to look at...
ERHARD
By the way, you’re not afraid of me, you’re afraid of looking bad.
KEVIN
I’m not afraid of you...
ERHARD
That’s right. You’re afraid of looking bad.
KEVIN
I’m a little bit afraid of you.
(laughter)
ERHARD
I’m going to leave you with that delusion.
(laughter)
WES
Inside of what you’ve said, I’ll give you another way of looking at it, or an aspect of it--
something to hang out with tonight along with Werner’s comment about your stinginess: you’ve 
been resisting being in a coaching conversation. 
KEVIN
Yes.
