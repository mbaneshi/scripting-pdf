SPEAKING BEING
JOAN
Start my own business.
KIPP
Okay.
JOAN
Or work for a small company.
KIPP
Let’s take those two for an example, Okay? Start your own business, work for a small company: 
choose!
JOAN (laughing)
Start my own company.
KIPP
Perfect! Now why are you going to start your own company? “I’m going to start my own compa-
ny because...”
JOAN
Because my father did.
KIPP
Perfect reason! That’s an example of a decision. What has you now starting your own company 
is your father did that: That’s not you making a choice, is it? It’s your father, so if it doesn’t work
out, you can kick the shit out of your father.
(laughter)r
Decisions get you off  the hook, don’t they? Because the reason “because my father did” has you 
starting your own company, not you. When you make a choice, you’re the chooser. You can 
still have all the thoughts; you can still carefully consider it all. I’m not saying to throw out the 
analysis. But if what you do is based on your analysis, I promise you a future determined by 
the past. Because analysis is always looking where? What’s already happened! And so far, that’s 
where you look in your life. You go:
(contorting his body to look behind him)
“Let’s see what’s possible in my life.”
JOAN (laughing)
Yes I do that.
