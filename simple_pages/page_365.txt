Forum Day Four: Session One

can’t get to empty and meaningless in-order-to. And every time you turn it into an in-order-to, 
you lose that it’s empty and meaningless, because the truth is sucked out of it, and it becomes a 
mere platitude. 
DENNIS
I just want to end with saying that I will leave here with the thought that life is empty and 
meaningless and that opens up a possibility.
ERHARD
I don’t want you to leave with “it opens up a possibility.” That ruins it.
DENNIS
Is that an in-order-to?
ERHARD
Yeah. See, you’re a real in-order-to guy. That’s not bad. That’s not an insult. That’s highly valued 
in this culture. We place a lot of value in this culture in in-order-to.
DENNIS
Thank you.
ERHARD
Yep. Very good. Thank you.

What is your story?
JOYCE
My story is that I get it and I reject it.
ERHARD
Okay. Don’t do that. What are you crying about? Do you know? Yeah, you know, what are you 
crying about?
JOYCE
Because I came to make a change in my life and I don’t see it happening. 
ERHARD
Yes. I understand. So, you wanted to make a change in your life because there’s a little suff er-
ing there, yes? Yeah. The way to perpetuate the suff ering is to try to change your life. You stop 
changing your life, the suff ering will go away. Is that clear?
