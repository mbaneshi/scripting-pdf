Forum Day Four: Session Two

DONALD (sitting)
Okay I’m done.
TIM
The diffi  culty I’m having is to get the baggage away from the problem I carry because of the cul-
ture and my own experiences, because when I hear the word “problem,” whether it “shouldn’t
be” or “in life there are problems,” there are invitations to certain kinds of action around the
word problem, like “solve it,” or “do something about it.”
WES
Very good. Yeah.
TIM
Or “remedy.”
WES
Sure, we haven’t gotten there yet. “Shouldn’t be”: What is the response to something that
shouldn’t be?
TIM
You get rid of it...
WES
Get rid of it. Do something about it. Solve it. Fix it. Change it. Right?
TIM
Right. Find the solution.
WES
Find the solution. Solve it! See we never notice something. Let me tell you something about this
conversation. We’re doing diff erent dimensions. It isn’t like you have to get everything on the
same dimension. But you have to get the dimensions to get the conversations. We did this on
the fi rst day, right? In geometry we learned about three axes.
Wes drew a diagram on the board representing the x, y, and z axes.
WES (continuing)
You know you can’t collapse those. That’s the very nature of them, that they are distinct axes;
they etch out diff erent dimensions. What people try to do to fi gure things out—because fi guring
out has to have things in a linear fashion—is they try to fi t everything on a single axis. What
they don’t see is that there’s power in creating in a conversation a group of dimensions, which
when you get them all, you get the picture. You can’t put a sphere on one dimension, can you?

SPEAKING BEING
You can’t even put a circle in one dimension. Before you can have a circle you have to create
the two dimensions. So we’re creating diff erent dimensions in this conversation. Okay, so we’ll
jump dimensions somewhat.
TIM
So, your invitation to me is to look at the possibility that the word “problem” can exist in a dif-
ferent dimension than with “solution.”
WES
Yeah: a diff erent context in which you will not be immediately moved to solve it.
TIM
Got it.
WES
Hold on a second. What you’re bringing up is great. This whole thing about problem/solution:
Here’s one thing that people almost always never get.
Wes walked over to a the chalkboard on stage right and erased “Right/wrong; dominate/avoid domi-
nation; justifi es itself/invalidates others.”
WES (continuing)
Take a look at any problem that you’ve had and look at what you’ve done with it. What you’ve done
with it is: solved it in some way. The way people solve problems is they do something about it, and
if that didn’t work, they do something more, and if that didn’t work, they do something better, and
if that didn’t work, they do something diff erent. They are led to dealing with it, solving it.
(drawing a “P” on the board and then encircling it)
You’ve got a problem, and then you solve it. What happens with regard to the solution to the
problem?
TIM
It becomes a truth, or something right, the right thing to do.
WES
Yes. But it’s worse than that. You have to actually look at a problem that you’ve had that you’ve solved
and then look at the solution to see what happened to it. Take a look at a problem that you had.
TIM
I’m thinking: Some solutions become problems.
WES
Yes, exactly! The solution becomes your next problem.
