SPEAKING BEING
JOYCE
Yeah.
ERHARD
People are acting up there. It’s not for real. This is your act, not liking yourself. It’s your act.
JOYCE
I get that. I get that I put on an act.
ERHARD
There’s nothing to like or not like. What does that mean: like or don’t like? You are the way you 
are. That’s the whole story, isn’t it?
JOYCE
Yeah.
ERHARD
And you’re always going to be the way you are. And you’re going to be the way you are when 
you are the way you are. Today you are the way you are today. Tomorrow you’ll be like the way 
you’ll be tomorrow. And the day after that you’ll be like you are the day after that. And that’s 
going to be true for the rest of your life. What is this conversation like or don’t like yourself? 
What does this mean? This is insane this conversation I like, I don’t like. And you ought to be 
able to begin to see the insanity of it. It’s like really insane. What is it about, for God’s sake? 
What is the point? The point is drama, like soap opera. You know, you use life to make a soap 
opera: that’s disgusting. Life is empty and meaningless. It’s just like that.
JOYCE
I see that. It doesn’t make any diff erence whether I like myself or not. But I’m stuck. I want to 
like myself. 
ERHARD
But no. Let me ask you something. Listen up you all! What happens when you raise the issue of 
liking yourself? What has to go with the issue of liking yourself? Must. What is it that has to be 
there in order for you to like yourself? There’s only one thing that has got to be there for you to 
have the issue of liking yourself.
JOYCE
What would have to go with it?
ERHARD
Yeah. What is it that has to be there in order for you to like yourself? There’s only one thing 
that’s got to be there.
