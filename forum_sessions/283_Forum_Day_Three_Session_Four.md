KIPP
As long as youâ€™ve got some way you think it should be, that means it means something. And as
long as it means something, that meaning has you.
DON
Exactly.
KIPP
Thank you.
(Applause)
SANFORD
I would like to share where Iâ€™m at right now and Iâ€™m just being.
KIPP
Great! Just being.
SANFORD
Yeah.
KIPP
And the only time youâ€™re being is when?
SANFORD
Right now.
KIPP
When youâ€™re being. And the only time Iâ€™m going to catch you not being is when? When youâ€™re
not being.
SANFORD
Yeah.
KIPP
Thank you very much. Fred?
FRED
I fi nally got down to my big racket of rackets and thatâ€™s being sad.
ERHARD
Listen up here. You may not be sad; you may be something else. What you always are or often
are, that you donâ€™t want to be? Thatâ€™s a racket.

SPEAKING BEING
FRED
And at dinner I got to what the cost is, because when I see all the happiness around here, I
just want to push it all down. And what I discovered about how I dominate is I donâ€™t want you
to be happier than I am. So I come in with sad, and I really get sad and I get heavy with the
sadness. But what I also discovered was this incredible disempowerment just all the way down.
If I make a commitment and something happens like I donâ€™t want to fulfi ll that, then I go into
sadness, and then I donâ€™t want to do anything, like the whole bottom falls out. So any joy in my
relationship with my wife? Well I donâ€™t want her to be quite that much happier than I am. I take
away all that joy...
ERHARD
Because if you donâ€™t have sadness, and sadness is the way you dominate and avoid domination...
If you donâ€™t have sadness you lose your weapon. You canâ€™t be happy except tentatively. Just for a
little while maybe. Very good. Continue.
FRED
So also what Iâ€™ve looked at: Iâ€™ve been talking about having a television show for two years.
To have teenagers and parents interact in a powerful way to get over all this stuff  about clean
rooms. And whenever I get up to speed about that I get sad. And I donâ€™t want to do that. Iâ€™m
avoiding the domination of being powerful and making that kind of contribution to the world.
ERHARD
Thatâ€™s hard to hearâ€”avoid the domination of being powerful. Itâ€™s hard to hear.
FRED
I donâ€™t want that domination. I want to be free just in my relationship with my wife. I donâ€™t
want to be dominated by my commitment to her. I want to be away from that. Iâ€™ve dominated
with anger, and with depression, and now with sadness.
KIPP
Thereâ€™s no freedom in wanting to be free. It sounds free but it is the trap. Whatever you canâ€™t be
with has you.
FRED
I found what this was all covering up. I just donâ€™t accept myself. I donâ€™t accept who I am. I have
a tremendous fear of just being with, being with who I am.
KIPP
Yeah but that tremendous fear is what comes with being a human being. You donâ€™t make it up;
it makes you up.
ERHARD
I donâ€™t like the term fear here. Iâ€™d like to be a little more precise. Itâ€™s really a threat in the form of
the domination. The fear is just a part of it. In other words, your emotional system is going to be
