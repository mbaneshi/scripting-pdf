SPEAKING BEING
BILL
Chocolate.
KIPP
Perfect! Now why’d you choose chocolate?
BILL (after a long pause)
I chose chocolate...
KIPP
Because...
BILL
If I put a because in there it’ll be a decision...
KIPP
We did this before, it works...
(laughter)r
“I chose chocolate because...”
BILL
I chose chocolate... because it’s black. I don’t know.
KIPP
Perfect! So, along came this thought...Peep!
(pulling another tissue from the box and dangling it
(
)
“Because it’s black.” And what did the selecting was the reason, the feeling, the thought, the
consideration, the evidence, the something did the selecting, not you. So that’s a clear-cut deci-
sion.
BILL
How do I get out of this?
KIPP
You keep inquiring, just like you’re doing. You’re doing perfectly. Okay? Ready to go again?
BILL
Yeah.
