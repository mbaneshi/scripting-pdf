Forum Day Four: Session One

to let you know that...I just called to say hello.” We just kind of talked. And she told me what
was going on with her. I told her that our wedding was great and that I got back great pictures
from the photographer, that I couldn’t wait to show them to her, that I really love her. She said
to me, well, I said to her that I don’t know how to create a relationship, or how to have a kind
of relationship that works for you. I keep trying to do something and I haven’t been doing any-
thing that’s really worked. “All I’ve done is fi gured out what was wrong with you or what was
wrong with me and try to tell you that, and make you do something diff erent.” And she said
to me, “just be yourself.” You know, it was really remarkable. Because whatever she’s going
through she’s going through. And my father just died and she told me that, you know, she just
shared with me a little bit about that...
KIPP
She said?
MARGARET
She said: “It’s tough and I don’t know how I’m going to get over it and what I’m going to do.”
And I also saw... My mother and my brothers have been saying to me: “You don’t live in the
same city we do, you can’t have the same kind of relationship we have with each other.” And
I saw that she’s upset that I don’t live where she lives. I’ve never heard it like that before. So
we just had a conversation where there was no sting anymore. There was no more me trying
to get her to do something. It was a conversation where we were actually talking to each other
instead of me trying to get her to do something. And it’s a beginning. And I also said to her that
all I was committed to was that she really, you know, have her life work for her. And I had no
idea what that was going to be and she didn’t either. It was really a beginning, a place to talk
to each other from. And I saw I wasn’t trying to get her to do something. So however I hung
up the phone, I was satisfi ed, and however way I’ve been operating never left me satisfi ed in
talking to her.
KIPP
Anything else?
MARGARET
One of the things I came to The Forum to get is a way of working with the people I work with
that I don’t live like some special unique human being, but really able to contribute whatever
distinctions are clear to me to them so that they can get done whatever I can get done. And I
can see, who I’d have... I have no idea how to do it and actually live like a possibility for me,
inside my relationship with the people I work with, rather than something I’m supposed to do,
someway I have to be in order to make it. And how I’ve been... when I couldn’t be with some-
thing I didn’t know how to do, or continuing to stand in the face of not knowing how to deliver
on all the work that we’ve got, not knowing how to do that. What I do is I use force instead of
being able to be with whatever’s happening.

SPEAKING BEING
Erhard entered at the side of the room, wearing a brown sweater-vest and gray-brown slacks.
He stood in the back, listening, looking around the room, occasionally greeting and touching a
participant.
KIPP
That’s a big one. See, when you can’t be with what’s happening, what you’re always left with is
force, no power.
MARGARET
That’s it.
KIPP
Okay. Thank you very much.
(applause)
Clear on the empty and meaninglessness that life is, or the meaning you’ve given to the empty
and meaningless. One of those two.
JEB
I woke this morning and realized I am the sum total of my likes and dislikes, that’s all I
am. I am the sum total of my likes and dislikes, no more than that.
KIPP
Yes, so, if you take a person’s life, and you put all their opinions in a jar, and you stick them in
the jar with it, that’s their life. What they like and what they don’t like; what they agree with
and what they don’t agree with; what they think is good, and what they think is bad; what they
think is right and what they think is wrong.
ERHARD
Is it possible to get some insight into how stupid that is? The signifi cance with which we have
given to what we like and don’t like, with what you agree and don’t agree with, with what you
want and don’t want? Is it possible to get some insight into how trivial and trivializing that is
to your life? I told you I would tell you about the spiritual exercise. You have to do the spiritual
exercise at night, because it has to be dark out, and it has to be clear out so that you can see
the stars. Here in San Francisco that isn’t always easy, but sometimes. Go down to the beach
at about two or three in the morning when there’s nobody there, and look up at the sky, at the
stars. When you get over the awe—and we always do, don’t we?—as soon as you get over the
awe, what you do is you watch the stars very, very, very carefully. You have to watch them very
carefully. Watch the stars very carefully while you tell the stars your opinions, what you don’t
like and what you do like, what you agree with and what you don’t agree with, and particularly
tell them what you want and what you don’t want. If you’ve watched them very carefully, at the
