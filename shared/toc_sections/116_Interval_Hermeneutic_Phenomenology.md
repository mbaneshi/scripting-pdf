SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Don’t try to digest everything. What I want you to do is stand in it and look out in life.
MIKE
How do I do that?
ERHARD
Tell me how to walk. And then I’ll tell you how to do that.
MIKE
Lean forward.
ERHARD
Tell me how to lean forward.
MIKE
Bend your back.
ERHARD
Tell me how to bend my back.
(silence)
The truth is, you don’t know how to walk. You walk, but you don’t know how to walk. You
don’t walk out of “knowing how.” Even if you studied anatomy and knew every single muscle I
needed to use, and understood the operation of all the parts of the body, and all the neural path-
ways impulses had to be sent down, you wouldn’t know how to generate them in the fi rst place,
besides which, you couldn’t keep all that in mind to lift one leg up, let alone to walk, right? The
fact is you don’t know how to walk. You just walk.
MIKE
I guess I never looked at it from that point of view.
ERHARD
You never looked at it from that point of view. You don’t need to guess about it. Who you are is
an “I guess.” You don’t know how to walk, do you?
MIKE
I can walk.
ERHARD
Yes. That’s not in discussion.
Forum Day Two: Session One

MIKE
Yes, I know how to walk.
ERHARD
Okay, tell me.
MIKE
No, I don’t know how to walk.
ERHARD
Okay good.
(to the group)
You’ve all got a lot of stupid notions. You’re a bunch of thoughtless people. You’ve given very
little thought to anything of signifi cance. You have a lot of thoughts, but you don’t give thought.
So in here, you and I are going to give thought. Like most of the other people on the plan-
et, Mike never stopped to look at whether he knew how to walk: wasn’t too important to his
walking, so why bother? But in here, some of the things you take for granted, we won’t take
those things for granted. See, it’s common sense that if a person walks they know how to. But
Mike and I just reduced the idea of knowing how to walk to an absurdity. Maybe knowing how
is not the pathway. You can’t produce art by the numbers. So getting back to this standing in a
possibility: you think it, not believe it or agree with it. You think it. You think: “people are ac-
complished in-order-to.” So what they get is avoiding the “order-to.” But avoiding the “order-to”
is the same as being attached to the “order-to.” Stand in there and take a look at life from there
and think that, generate it as a possibility. Speak to yourself or others. Clear?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
Thank you. That was a very useful conversation.
MIKE
Thank you.
(applause)
ERHARD (returning to Marsha)
So Marsha, you were saying?
MARSHA
I’m angry at everyone in the world, because what I know about each person in the world is that
they don’t like me. I’m angry at them.
Giving and Reflexion
In his use here of the word “gives,” Erhard is employing a term
that was central in Heidegger’s eff orts to say the relationship of
language to Being.
For anyone who has participated in the work of Werner Er-
hard, and has experienced the way that a particular combination
of words can make available a new perspective on the world, a
primary delight in reading Heidegger is surrendering to his precise
and profoundly reflexive languaging. Its frequent circularity is
consistent with its purpose, which is not to take us anywhere new,
but to bring us “back to where we already are,” which, he warns, is
“infinitely harder.” His task is to “think Being without beings”—that
is, to bring Being to language as distinct from beings, a distinction
that has been lost to our metaphysical tradition. He wants to say
Being; his task is therefore “unceasingly to overcome the obstacles
that tend to render such saying inadequate” (OTB 24).
The Being of Language
One of these obstacles he confronts in undertaking this task is
found in the nature of language itself. Language was increasingly
the focus in Heidegger’s later writing, and his most well-known
statement is his assertion that “Language is the House of Being”
(“LH” in BW 217). But what about the Being of language itself?
W
Here Heidegger articulates the conundrum:
“
We speak of language, but constantly seem
to be speaking merely about language, while
in fact we are already letting language, from
within language, speak to us, in language, of
itself, saying its nature. (“NL” in OWL 85)
Heidegger’s characteristic response to this aporic puzzle is to
problematize it further, beginning with a line from the German
poet Stefan George, which reasserts his own view of language:
“Where word breaks off  no thing may be.” He teases us into the
paradox created by this statement: if without language things can-
not be, then things are only when the word already is. But is a word
a thing? On the one hand, it seems so: “if the word is to endow the
thing with being, it too must be before any thing is—thus it must
104
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
So, “I am ‘they don’t like me’ waiting to happen.” The already always listening I am is “you
don’t like me, so what was that you were going to say?”
MARSHA
I am already always “you don’t like me.” I’m angry at that.
ERHARD (to the group)
Yeah. And something happened when Marsha was a little girl. And when somebody didn’t like
her, getting angry worked for that little girl. Now the little girl is running the mature woman
with a lot of relational skills being put to use by a little girl who gets angry because people don’t
like her. There’s a little girl mashed in with a mature and competent woman. And the mashing
is that the little girl is in charge, calling the shots. And the mature competent woman keeps her
in charge by being afraid she might be angry, and not wanting to be. And see, the people who
can see Marsha now want to make her feel better. I don’t want to make her feel better. I want
her just like she is, because what she is doing is growing up. She’s getting to the source of what
she’s afraid she might be. When she’s completed that, she’ll have a freedom to be that she didn’t
have before this conversation. She won’t know better how not to be angry. There’ll be a freedom
that wasn’t there before. She’ll be related to people eff ectively in order to be related to people
eff ectively. That’s fulfi lling. The thing in itself. Anything else?
MARSHA
I suppressed anger starting in the fi fth grade.
ERHARD
What happened?
(to the group)
Listen through the distinctions we developed yesterday. “People don’t like me” never happens.
It’s a story about what happens. “People don’t like me” can’t happen. If you can’t see that, stand
up?
A participant stood up and takes a microphone.
ERHARD
Lisa, I said, “people don’t like me” never happens.
LISA (smiling)
I get it now.
ERHARD
It never happens, it’s always a story isn’t it? It’s a story about what happened. Larry said you’re
a jerk. He might even have said, “I don’t like you.” That’s what happened, and you told the story
“people don’t like me.” “People don’t like me” can’t happen, can it?
inescapably be itself a thing” (“NL” in OWL 86). But can a thing
then give being to another thing? If things cannot be without the
prior existence of words, the inevitable conclusion is that “word
and thing are diff erent, even disparate” (“NL” in OWL 86). But what
could be the nature of that diff erence?
Words can be said, but can the word for a word ever be said? A
dictionary is filled with terms, but no words, since “a dictionary can
neither grasp nor keep the word by which the terms become words
and speak as words.” When we try to think this, Heidegger proposes,
we seem to arrive at the conclusion that “saying has no being.” But
then another question presents itself: we say a thing is when a word
is available. But what about the “is” itself? “The ‘is’ cannot be found
anywhere as a thing attached to a thing.” Indeed, “It belongs no more
among the things that are than does the word” (“NL” in OWL 87).
At this point in our thinking, we may throw in the towel; or,
says Heidegger, if we will follow him for one more step, we may be
struck by something we had not noticed. While we have reached no
answers in our inquiry—it has raised neither the word nor the “is”
nor the relation between the two to the status of thinghood—it has
pointed us toward something “thought-provoking and memorable.”
It has suggested the possibility of “what is there and yet ‘is’ not.”
“
The word, too, belongs to what is there—per-
haps not merely “too” but first of all, and even
in such a way such that the word, the nature
of the word, conceals within itself that which
gives [B]eing. If our thinking does justice to
the matter, then we may never say of the word
that it is, but rather that it gives—not in the
sense that words are given by an “it,” but that
the word itself gives. (“NL” in OWL 87-88)
Out of the unspoken background, the word gives a context of
meaning for human action.
Thus we have dug down to the essential simplicity: es gibt (it
t
gives). Heidegger is languaging the Being/being relationship that
is also the heart of his important term, appropriation. As we will
show later in this book, the nature of appropriation is absolutely
central to the ultimate rhetorical move of The Forum.

(Lisa shakes her head)
Clear?
LISA
Yes.
ERHARD
Anybody else not get this?
(another participant stands)
MASON
So you’re saying it’s never possible that it’s people in general? It could be one person?
ERHARD
There’s no such thing as “people” happening.
MASON
So it could be Frank doesn’t like me.
ERHARD
Yeah. “People don’t like me” is always a story, isn’t it?
MASON
I got that.
ERHARD
“People don’t like me” never happened. “Nobody liked me” never happened. Always a story,
right?
(to Marsha)
What happened?
MARSHA
What happened is, from Kindergarten through fourth grade was fun. In the fi fth grade girls
were developing, noticing boys, but I was still in pigtails...
ERHARD
Hold on. You wanna start being able to be with people here. Whatever you were yesterday isn’t
going to work today. You have to be powerfully with people. You’ve got to be up on the edge
of your chair when this woman is giving you a gift you ain’t going to get again. You’re going to
Werner Erhard, who found in Heidegger’s vocabulary a way of
expanding the value that his own work made available, discussed
the nature of giving in a 1989 satellite telecast from New York City.
“
A distinction gives. It comes into existence
by giving. . . .  You’ve got to be able to think
something coming into existence in the act
of giving existence. Distinguishing arises in
the act of giving—hard for us to think about
because we can only think serially. I’m ask-
ing you to think of a new kind of relationship
called giving. . . . This is getting to the essence
of Being. There’s no such thing as Being. You
can’t separate Being from the world, therefore
there’s no such thing as Being. . . . Being arises
in the act of giving. (“Beyond the Winning
Formula”)
Reflexive languaging demands that thinking bend back on itself.
Such languaging is inherent in thinking about Being; note how that
very phrase tickles the mind.
While Heidegger’s writing is oft en considered to be highly
complex, he suggests an alternate view: “What is strange in the
thinking of Being is its simplicity. Precisely this keeps us from it”
(“LH” in BW 263, emphasis added). Heidegger teases out this idea
W
further in his “Letter on Humanism.” At one point in the letter,
when considering the role of language in Being, he calls attention
to a specific instance of its simplicity:
“
But just now an example of the inconspicu-
ous deed of thinking manifested itself. For to
the extent that we expressly think the usage
“bring to language,” which was granted to
language, think only that and nothing fur-
ther, to the extent that we retain this thought
in the heedfulness of saying as what in the
future continually has to be thought, we have
brought something of the essential unfolding
of Being itself to language. (“LH” in BW 263)

SPEAKING BEING
go back out of here three days from now, and nobody’s gonna talk this straight to you. You’re
going to go out and have those chicken shit conversations with people. So you want to get what
you can out of this. And you aren’t going to be able to see this in yourself until you can see it
in Marsha. All that sadness of the fi fth grader is there right now. Marsha’s got a fi fth grader
running her life. This is a mature, attractive, confi dent, accomplished woman with a fi fth grader
calling the shots.
(to Marsha)
You were saying?
MARSHA
Suddenly there was a distinction. It was not okay with the other girls that I was not growing up.
They starting getting in like a clique. And...
ERHARD
Talking behind your back and excluding you, and no longer was there that kind of loose easy
sense of being with people. Now it was a drama to be with people: a kind of plot; a kind of
strategy.
MARSHA
What I saw worked a little bit was to start getting happy, bubbly.
ERHARD
So this is pretty intelligent for a fi fth grader. It makes very good sense for a ten-year-old girl to
say the answer to this is to be happy all the time. You got to remember this is Marsha inventing
Marsha. This is Marsha inventing her identity. She has happiness as a way to push away sad-
ness. Then what happened?
MARSHA
As we grew up, they were the attractive ones, the cheerleaders; the boys were interested in
them...
ERHARD
Listen up here, because this is about to get really stupid. Here is a really attractive woman who’s
going to tell you she was not in with the girls who were attractive. Stupid in the sense that this
is not logical.
MARSHA
Up until the fi fth grade I was called ___, after my ninety year old aunt who was an “old maid.”
ERHARD (to the group, lightly)
How come men are bachelors and women are called old maids? I don’t get it.
ERHARD (continuing)
In considering reflexive languaging, one is immediately reminded
of koan meditation—the process in which a Zen student is assigned
a single problematic phrase upon which he or she meditates until
its embedded ontological hurdle has been made. The paradigmatic
koan is the question, “What is the sound of one hand clapping?”
Heidegger’s paragraph above, considered carefully, pulls one
toward koan-like thinking.
Michael E. Zimmerman has likened Heidegger’s use of
aporia—unresolvable problems—to the existential puzzles found
in koans. As an example, he cites the aporic conceptual dilem-
ma, central to Heidegger’s thought, that Being is inconceivable
except as a being, and yet no being can be a being without a prior
experience of its Being. As Zimmerman points out, the solution
to such aporia is beyond the capabilities of rational thought; and
this is precisely the power of reflexion, that it turns the thinker’s
thinking reflexively in upon itself, demanding a diff erent kind of
d
thinking and thus a diff erent thinker: “Before one can speak about
the diff erence between Being and beings, it is crucial that one put
oneself in the position of being able to experience that diff erence”
(“Heidegger and Heraclitus on Spiritual Practice” 100). Participants
in The Forum have put themselves in that position.
The experience of engaging one’s mind with a profoundly
relexive idea may be imagined as the process of revving an engine
so hard that the torque sends it flying off  its mounts. This image
calls to our minds the way participants in The Forum “get it” aft er
several days of struggling to understand it conceptually.
Reflexive languagings, and the thinking they demand, are cen-
tral in the work of both Heidegger and Erhard. Erhard distinguishes
thinking from having thoughts, and he hints at the diff erence using
such languaging as “This statement is false,” “I always lie,” or “A
superstition is a superstition only when it isn’t a superstition, and
a superstition isn’t a superstition only when it is a superstition.”
Such statements call for thinking, call for the movement of thought
l
through the structure given in language. ■
