Forum Day Four: Session One

JULIE
And then I would start bitching.
ERHARD
Exactly. This is a wise woman. How does she know “then I would start bitching”? Because you
always bitch. That’s like shooting fi sh in a barrel, that kind of a prediction. I told you about the
Boy Scouts. It didn’t make any diff erence: “Today we’re going on a hike”; “Today we’re going
swimming.” “Oh no!” Everything was “oh no!” So, you can’t get anything out of this. I told you
the truth. You don’t use the truth; the truth uses you.
SALLY
Where I keep... I guess where I keep getting stuck is I want to get it so that possibility opens up.
ERHARD
That’s an in-order-to. That’s called a “rice Christian”: That’s when you go to church to get rice.
Getting paid. Most of you go to church in-order-to, don’t you? Sure you do. Don’t bullshit me. I
know why you go to church. You go to church in-order-to. It’s sacrilegious.
(asking a participant to stand up; turning back to Sally)
So you’ve just got to get rid of the in-order-tos: Whether you do or not is up to you, not up to me.
SALLY
But aren’t they just going to keep coming back?
ERHARD
Sure, they’re going to keep coming back; that’s why you’ve got to be able to dwell in that it’s
empty and meaningless, and that it’s empty and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless.
Dwell in; not believe, not understand, not remember. That’s why we don’t speak in concepts in
here, because concepts are things people remember and forget. Distinctions remember you. You
don’t remember them; they remember you. You don’t use them; they use you. That’s why we’ve
got this funny language. It’s the language of distinction, not the language of conceptualization.
(to Sally)
What else?
SALLY
I’m going to sit down, because I don’t know what there is I have to do.
ERHARD
There’s nothing you have to do.
Thus nihilism consists in the avoidance of the nothing, since by
avoiding nothingness, we in fact avoid the full disclosure of Being.
Thereby, we retain an incomplete apprehension of our possibility
as beings. Nevertheless, Heidegger does not deny that the “Nothing”
speaks something fundamentally disturbing:
The nothing itself does not attract; it is
essentially repelling. But this repulsion is
itself as such a parting gesture toward beings
that are submerging as a whole. This wholly
repelling gesture toward beings that are in
retreat as a whole, which is the action of the
nothing that oppresses Dasein in anxiety, is the
essence of the nothing: nihilation. It is neither
an annihilation of beings nor does it spring
from a negation. Nihilation will not submit
to calculation in terms of annihilation and
negation. The nothing itself nihilates. (“WM” in
BW 103
W
)
“
As Being and beings move apart, as Being withdraws into its
always-potential concealment, the everyday meaning of beings is
ongoingly subject to nihilation. Revealing and concealing, Being
gives and nothing nihilates. This is the way of the world. And in
the nihilating of the nothing lies the possibility of the clearing:
In the clear night of the nothing of anxiety the
original openness of beings as such arises: that
they are beings—and not nothing.  [. . .] The
essence of the originally nihilating nothing
lies in this, that it brings Da-sein for the first
time before beings as such. Only on the ground
of the original revelation of the nothing can
human existence approach and penetrate
beings. (“WM” in BW 103
W
)

SPEAKING BEING
SALLY
So then I’m going to sit down.
ERHARD
No. You’re only going to sit down if you do. You’re not going to sit down because there’s nothing
to do; you’re going to sit down if you sit down. And if you don’t sit down, you don’t sit down.
You’re not going to sit down “because.” You’re still trying to fi nd something to save you. There’s
no life rings in here. This is the place where we take all the life rings away. There’s nothing to
stand on. I want you to stand on nothing. I want you to stand on empty and meaningless. Meet
life with no foundation, with no background, with no learning. Yeah of course you have all the
learning and all the experience, but you’re not stuck with it. You’re not stuck with what you
know; you’re not stuck with your condition; you’re not stuck with your past.
SALLY
I have a question. So, if what I’m making it mean is that it’s hopeless: Are you saying that I
don’t have to make it mean that?
ERHARD
If what you’re making it mean is that it’s hopeless, what you want to do is to see that you are
making it mean that it’s hopeless. You’re doing that. Now, by the way: It is hopeless. And the
reason it’s hopeless is because of what you have to have if you’re going to have hope. There’s
only one thing you’ve got to have. Hope cannot exist without hopelessness. And the stronger
you get your hopes up, the more down in the swamp, down at the bottom of the Valley of the
Shadow of Death, down in the swamp there, is hopelessness. So the more hope you’ve got, the
more green slimy monsters there are down in the Valley of the Shadow of Death. Hopelessness.
It lives down in the swamp at the bottom of the Valley of the Shadow of Death, with all your
hope up there at the top, except the green slimy monsters keep you from ever being satisfi ed,
from ever being full of joy. Look, you make a drama up out of being tired. You should have seen
you the fi rst night. A true drama out of being tired; you make a fucking drama out of death.
That’s right, death is so nasty because you made a drama out of it. Death is nothing but dying.
It’s not a drama. Who said death was bad? You did. Okay fi ne: Pope. One thing. People worry
about death, right? What is there to worry about? Let me explain something to you: You are
going to die. Don’t worry. You are. You are going to die. And so is everybody else. Everybody
you love and care about, they’re all going to die. Don’t worry. They will.
(a participant objects)
You’re a bit nutty about this. You get up every time I talk about dying. And you know what?
You won’t die one minute before you do. And you want to know what? You won’t live one min-
ute longer when you’re dead. You don’t have to worry about that. It’s all taken care of. You’re
not going to die before you do and you’re not going to live after you die. Now you can worry
about something else. So that business about hope and hopelessness: It’s the same conversa-
tion about liking yourself. What is this hope crap? What does that change? What does that do?
What does that make? What is the value of hope? If you hope it’s going to turn out all right, that
This is an essential element of the approach to Being which is
taken in the dialogue of The Forum. To reach Being, one must
travel by way of the nothing. To discover possibility, one must
confront the facticity, the trap, of no-possibility. Further, what
Heidegger calls “authentic Being-towards-death,” or “freedom
towards death,” may be seen as consistent with these other
views: to experience the authentic possibility of one’s life, one
must confront one’s essential nullity. Conscience calls Dasein—
fallen into the untruth of the “they” self—to “appropriate
untruth authentically” (BT 345), to bring authenticity to one’s
T
inauthenticity, to be in the trap.
It is of the utmost importance, however, to stress again
this point: to “confront” means to experience an ontological
encounter, not merely an ontical or conceptual realization. For
r
instance, the merely ontic recognition that we all die is of course
commonplace. On the other hand, the ontological experience of
the death of one’s self as identity, and the deep realization of the
possibility of one’s self as an opening, with all the ramifications
of anxiety and homelessness which that experience entails, is far
from commonplace. This is the revelation of the nothing, the call
of conscience, which Heidegger posits as the ground for authentic
existence, and this is the encounter for which the rhetorical
structure of The Forum is designed.
Authentic inquiry into Being is likely to arouse resistance,
and this resistance may be located precisely at the juncture
where Being’s other side, the Nothing, must be confronted. Here
is the true challenge of Heidegger’s thinking, which Caputo calls
“the danger of Heidegger’s path”: at this juncture “there are no
assurances,” and “in this darkness and uncertainty lies one of the
largest difficulties with Heidegger’s work” (The Mystical Element
l
in Heidegger’s Thought 245). Caputo quotes Paul Huhnerfeld,
who has compared Heidegger’s way with religious paths to
transformation, such as that of the Christian mystic Meister
Eckhart: “Meister Eckhart would never have taken the mystical
step if he had believed that he was leaping into Nothingness
instead of into the arms of God” (245).
