Forum Day Three: Session Four
289
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Because given your past you’re probably not going to get off  it entirely, are you?
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
And that’s sensible and intelligent dealing with the future as an extension of the past. Did you
follow what I said?
JANE
A little.
ERHARD
When you said “I probably wouldn’t get off  it entirely,” I said that was an intelligent, sensible
extension of your past into the future.
JANE
Okay.
ERHARD
Good. Now there’s a particular discussion I want to have with you now. Our previous
discussions have been for your benefi t. This one I’m having for the benefi t of the group. I think
you have something to contribute here; that you will be an example that will illustrate what I
want people to be able to see as powerfully as anybody else in The Forum could illustrate it. I
want to be straight with you and tell you that so that I can fi nd out if you’re willing to have this
discussion with me. And you won’t know what that discussion is; you’ll have to take a chance.
I’m not saying you won’t get any value out of it, because you may. I suspect you will. Probably.
(Jane smiles)
Anybody see her smile like that before? Okay, so, you with me? Ready to do this?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Earlier we talked about when you were four, fi ve, or six, and what it looked like for someone
of that age for your mother to be taken away... you get that it would look that way for a child
that age, that “my mother left me, or abandoned me, or she was taken away”? By the way, it
doesn’t make any diff erence that she can’t remember that. Remember you told me you couldn’t
remember that very clearly? But we know it happened and that somebody either told you or you
fi gured it out. It’s not something you remember directly, right?

SPEAKING BEING
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Right. That’s there more powerfully than what she remembers. Is there anybody who doesn’t
understand what I just said? Stand up.
(a participant standing up)
I said, what’s there when it’s not recognized—I hate this word but I’m going to use it because
it’s getting late and I want people to understand—what’s there and unconscious is there more
powerfully in terms of its ability to shape your behavior and your feelings and thoughts than
what’s there and is conscious. You got that?
PARTICIPANT
Yeah, I got it.
ERHARD
Okay, so that’s there whether she remembers it or not. And then there was this woman who
came in and broke the bond, which was your haven, with your father.
JANE
Yes.
ERHARD
Good. And I said that... I fi rst asked if you made any decisions. You remember that?
(many participants replying “yes”)
Whatever it was, she made some decision. And I said this was a critical point, this was
something that everybody’s got to get. I said: “we talk about it like ‘I decided,’ and maybe you
did, but what really happened is that you became huh huh huh huh huh... You became that
‘I’m worthless.’ It’s not merely ‘I decided.’ That’s not forceful enough. It’s: you became ‘I’m
worthless.’” You remember that, vaguely?
JANE
A little.
ERHARD
Okay, good.
ERHARD (to the group)
You remember that?
