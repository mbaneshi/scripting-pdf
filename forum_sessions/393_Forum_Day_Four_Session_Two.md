Forum Day Four: Session Two

KIPP
Yeah.
PRESTON
But being with it so that I can operate from the box I call choice.
KIPP
When we get to this conversation about choice, being with choice, we’ll come back to that one.
Okay. Anything more for you, Preston?
PRESTON
No.
KIPP
Thank you.
(applause)
KIPP
So, we’re asking you to look at where in your life you have had reasons for not participating,
that’s the question at hand. And we’re distinguishing this distinction called reasonableness.
BARRY
It’s been entirely reasonable for me to keep myself distinct from people. Separate, not distinct.
KIPP
Yeah, separate.
BARRY
There’s a sense of being protected, of protecting myself. I feel like I’m not going to get sucked
into things that I don’t want to get sucked into. I choose the game; I choose the way it’s played.
KIPP
By the way, you don’t choose it.
BARRY
I decide what game to play...
KIPP
You use the evidence that’s given to you by your racket, and examine that evidence, and the
product of that evidence has you do what you do. And the product of that evidence is “lots of
reasons.”
When we are there with a being in the moment of its undistorted
emerging, prior to assertions—that begins to get at what is meant
by Aletheia: a free way of encountering beings that allows them to
be the things they are.
However, according to Thomas Sheehan, in his book Making
Sense of Heidegger, there are not just two, but three ways in which
Heidegger treats Aletheia, which will prove useful in an analysis of
The Forum’s methodology. We remind the reader, as we have done
throughout this book, that we are talking about a realm that has
no levels. When talking about the realm of Being, Werner Erhard
has said, all we can do is lie (“All I Can Do Is Lie.”). But that does not
mean we should stop talking, and Thomas Sheehan has opened
some interesting possibilities for thinking. Sheehan proposes that
Aletheia may be thought of as having three levels—that is, that
there are three ways of understanding what Heidegger meant
when dealing with the “truth”:
Aletheia 1, Aletheia 2, and Aletheia 3.
Aletheia 3 refers to the correctness of a statement—the
correspondence of a proposition with the state of aff airs to which
it refers. This definition glosses many aspects of evaluation and
judgment, of course, but it is what we generally mean when we
use the word “truth” in our everyday conversations. Aletheia 3
also indicates the average level of truth we expect in our everyday
coping in the world, and it is the kind of truth that operates within
our “stories.”
Aletheia 2 is the pre-propositional meaningful presence of
things in the world, the realm of inescapable meaning in which
we live our lives. For human beings, everything means something,
that is, can be understood as something. Aletheia 2 is the kind of
truth that emerges when participants distinguish “what hap-
pened” as distinct from their story about what happened.
Aletheia 1 is existential openness, the realm of unspoken
meaninglessness. This is the context for the other two realms, and
Sheehan calls this context the “unique presence-by-absence of the
thrown-open clearing” (Thomas Sheehan, Making Sense of Heideg-
ger 75). This is the groundless ground of our humanity, Being’s gift :
r
the Nothing.

SPEAKING BEING
BARRY
Loads of them.
KIPP
Yes.
BARRY
And I noticed yesterday in the danger process that I took from that, that my experience of that,
what I created was that my experience was shallow, that I was shallow, my emotional states in
both directions were. And...
KIPP
You don’t have much range of participation for yourself?
BARRY
Yes, I inherently limit that. And the idea of terror, although I know it’s true, I didn’t even have a
direct experience of that, so I had an experience of not having an experience of that.
KIPP
In place of a reason for not having it...
BARRY
Well, up to that point, yes. And even at that point. I said “Okay, that’s a reason. And this is me,
and this is now, and here I am, and let that be for the fi rst time.” And a big part of the story of
the racket had been that I just don’t feel deep emotions.
KIPP
Yeah, “you know me. I just don’t feel them. Some people got ’em, some people don’t.”
BARRY
And I don’t like it but it’s safer than having them. So I got to “Okay that’s where I am.” And
kind of cooked along in it and noticed that for me my thoughts are like one of those signs that
gives you the news while you’re standing in line at the deli, that makes you dizzy when you
watch it too long.
KIPP
It’s not limited to you, by the way.
BARRY
And I noticed there was really no diff erence as they were coming by as they did, and by not
ascribing signifi cance to any of those thoughts and letting them be there, I just noticed that
Erhard’s methodology of inquiry, a strategic recursive practice
iterated in each conversation with each participant, discloses the
Being of human being beyond the everyday propositional level
(Aletheia 3
(
). In order to accomplish this, the level of “truth” called
Aletheia 3 must first be distinguished as itself—as the level of un-
f
committed understandings of the world: the justifications, reasons,
explanations, and prescriptions regarding the circumstances of
one’s life and the strategies enacted to deal with those circumstanc-
es, what in The Forum is distinguished as one’s story. It is to this
level of truth that Erhard refers when he declares that he does not
know the truth, as any statement taken as an assertion to be used
in some way in-order-to already has lost any of its truth value.
In the process of distinguishing Aletheia 3 as Aletheia 3, as story,
a further background becomes accessible as the background from
which Aletheia 3 is disclosed. This further background is Aletheia
2, which in the conversation of The Forum is the what happened.
As the smokescreen of our crystallized stories dissipates, Aletheia
2 becomes distinguished from the “truth” of Aletheia 3, the level of
truth in which “what happened” has heretofore been held. What
was formerly the “truth” becomes disclosed as an interpretation
forgotten as such, an interpretation that can never reach the “what
happened.” At this new level of truth, what happened becomes
d
opened up as what happened, and now unhinged, so to speak,
from the narrow meaning the story had framed it within. Thereby
whatever happened becomes open to be taken a multitude of ways;
it becomes possible to see that there could be many ways to make
“what happened” meaningful, and to see that we will never be able
to speak a single truth concerning what happened.
What makes distinguishing Aletheia 3 and Aletheia 2 possible
is the background of the unspoken realm of Being, Aletheia 1, the
background of meaninglessness, of Nothing, in which our world of
meaning arises. That is to say, the reiterative acts of distinguishing in
language “story” and “what happened” already and always evokes
“life is empty and meaningless, and it is empty and meaningless
that life is empty and meaningless” as the background context, or
clearing for meaningful presence. We cannot grasp the nature of a
