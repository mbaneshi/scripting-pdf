SPEAKING BEING
GLORIA
I don’t go to church. 
ERHARD
Yeah, you’re a “rice Christian.” I don’t care whether you go to church or not, you’re a “rice 
Christian.” You don’t work to work. You work in-order-to. That makes you a slave. 
GLORIA
That’s human. We’re all human.
ERHARD
Horseshit, human. It’s crap. See, you just used the truth to justify something. You took all of the 
truth out of it. Yes, it is quite human and it justifi es nothing, it explains nothing, and if it does 
justify or explain something it is no longer the truth. It’s just some stupid justifi cation.
GLORIA 
I can’t get any possibility out of it. 
ERHARD
No, because you haven’t gotten it yet.
GLORIA
Okay.
ERHARD
You’ve got to go through that feeling bad, Gloria. You get to feeling bad and stop. You’ve got to 
go all the way through the feeling bad. Did you get that? You’ve got to go all the way through 
it. You still have got something there. You haven’t gotten to empty and meaningless yet. You’ve 
gotten to “empty and meaningless and that’s bad.” That’s not all the way through it. Clear?
GLORIA
Yeah.
ERHARD
Good for you.

Jake?
On the fi rst day of The Forum, Jake, an architect, was the participant who was “hustle waiting to 
happen,” and who also had his “foot nailed to the fl oor” in regard to sincerity and inauthenticity.
