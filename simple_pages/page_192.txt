SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Yes. That’s the smell of enlightenment. You want to keep your enlightenment to yourself and 
not let the smell out. What you want to share with people is empowerment, not enlightenment. 
You want to watch doing enlightenment with people, and it’s possible to empower people. 
If someone says something stupid to you—I’m not telling you how to handle this, I’m just 
illustrating that there’s a way to be with it—if somebody says something stupid to you, you can 
say, “okay, I understand exactly what you’re saying.” That gives you much more of an opening 
than “that’s stupid.” I don’t talk like this outside of here. I don’t use all this jargon outside of 
here. I use it in here because there’s a reason to. Now, you’re going to be stupid. You’re going 
to use all the terminology inappropriately. And there’s not much you can do about it. It’s hard 
not to. If we could take it back before you left here, we would, so you would just be left with 
yourself. All this stuff  in here is not signifi cant. The only thing signifi cant is you. And you can 
work your way through those things with your husband now that you’re hip to what’s going 
on. It’s a pretty exciting thing to think about the possibility of marriage beyond the games in 
marriages.
KIPP
So in sharing with your husband last night, you said?
SUSAN
I said “I’m sorry I was such a twit about signing up.”
ERHARD
A twit?
SUSAN
It’s softer language for me.
ERHARD
You cleaned it up for television.
KIPP
And he said?
SUSAN
He said “That’s all right, I love you.”
KIPP
And what was left? What were you then standing in?
SUSAN
Standing in my own decision.
“
If we could take it back before you left  
here, we would, so you would just be left  
with yourself. All this stuff  in here is not 
significant. The only thing significant
is you.
