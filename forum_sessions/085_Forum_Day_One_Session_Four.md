Forum Day One: Session Four

in life that’s worth knowing is merely an extension of what I already know. But the truth is that
everything worth knowing is going to violate what you know.
(continuing to read)
“The will to know does not will to abide in hope before what is worthy of thought.”
(to the group)
I think all there is, is having thoughts. But there are certain things that if you stand in front of
them in a certain way, give you thinking. If you stand in front of things worthy of thought you
get thinking. Thinking is a dance with that about which you are thinking. When you stand in
front of questions worthy of thought, you get thinking. Now that’s tough, because we’re in the
rainstorm called “I think.” We’re all Cartesians. No one’s had an original thought since then
about thinking—at least not one that has gotten to you or me. You and I are still Cartesians. But
there are possibilities beyond Descartes. And they give you access to a new way of being that
you can’t get to—being the kind of person you already always are. We’re going to be thinking.
That’s the way The Forum works. It goes backwards.
PARTICIPANT
What about disciplines that promise “inner transcendence”?
ERHARD
Inner transcendence. That’s what California is about. I don’t want to insult your pet project,
but I am not a guy in a diner about getting someplace. And you aren’t going to get there leaping
over being human. There’s no possibility of being beyond what you already always are until you
own what you already always are. Californians don’t like that. Californians have this magical
bullshit they believe in. That’s not the way The Forum works. The Forum’s got two pieces to it.
The first is an inquiry into the already always being of human being. What kind of an opening
are you for life? What’s the color of the clearing you are for life? To say that more rigorously:
what is the already always condition of being for human beings? What did you get yourself
into here? Not your individual version of being human. That’s the question of ninety percent of
The Forum. That’s called going backwards. It’s about owning yourself as you already are. Being
authentic about inauthenticity is particularly frightening for Californians. We don’t want to be
inauthentic. Why? Because it looks bad. And I don’t like looking bad. And your life is about
looking good. This is moving backwards to own what I already always am. This is not individ-
ualistic except that each of us has his or her own version, we got wet in this rainstorm called
human being. What is it to be a human being? See, people don’t ask that question. They want to
be thinner, younger, sexier. Those questions don’t give thinking. Because it is a question worthy
of thought it creates the possibility of thinking.
The Forum is two questions. The first: what is the already always being of human beings? Being
human owns you. It gives you your life. The second half of The Forum is another question. The
second question is, what is the possibility of being for human beings? What’s possible beyond
what I was given to be? I did what’s called in Zen the low road. In the low road you must do
everything that doesn’t work. So I’m not a guy in a diner about the low road. Most people want
“
There’s no possibility of being beyond what
you already always are until you own what
you already always are.

SPEAKING BEING
to start with the second question. But you can’t get to the possibility until you own what you
already always are. The pathway—concrete, authentic, real—is to embrace what you already
always are.
(pausing)
The problem is that if you move forward from where you are, all you’re doing is changing. The
medium in which you create may be something, but the source of creation is nothing. I had the
privilege of having a relationship with Dick Feynman, the physicist. He took one note the whole
time I knew him: “There are certain things you can only know by creating them.” As a matter
of fact, when he died that note was on his blackboard. That was just my best moment.
(pausing)
When I use the term possibility, I mean stuff in the dimension of “don’t know that you don’t
know.” So that’s what The Forum is about. In the first question, you move backwards. And it
begins with being authentic about your own inauthenticity. To the degree that you’re not able
to be with your own inauthenticity, to that degree you are unable to be. Where’s Jake? I want
to identify the conversation we were having. He’s a fine guy. And yet, I’m saying that there’s
something possible in that area he has a lot of interest that is denied to him because he can’t be
“I don’t do what I said I would do.” I didn’t say that was true about him. That’s not important.
What’s important is that he can’t be there yet. Whatever you’re not able to be with won’t let you
be. So the degree to which you are not able to be with your inauthenticity, to that degree you
are prevented from being. You’re stuck being this, so there’s nothing else you can be. Or you’re
stuck not being that, so there’s nothing else you can be except not that. You’re like a Johnny
one-note “not-that.” Not-that is way more attached than have-to-be-that.
I get this as a dance. I’m uncomfortable. I don’t know where to put my feet. It’s extremely un-
comfortable to be in that “don’t know that you don’t know.”
ERHARD
So “don’t know that you don’t know” is uncomfortable. Ever jumped out of an airplane? It’s
uncomfortable. It’s also a lot of fun.
PARTICIPANT
I’m starting to ask myself, “what is worthwhile?”
ERHARD
That’s a great question: A question to live with. If you live with that question for the rest of your
life, your life will have a quality that it won’t have without it. You ask the question for the light
the question gives.

To the degree that you’re not able to be with
your own inauthenticity, to that degree you
are unable to be.
