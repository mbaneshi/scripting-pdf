Forum Day Three: Session Four

going to be all right. You know how it’s going to be? Just like this. Yeah, it’s not gonna be all right.
It’s going to be like this. You’re either going to make it like this or you aren’t going to make it.
You’re either going to learn to be in prison or you’re just going to be unhappy. You’re going to be
in prison one way or the other. So, why did we talk about empty and meaningless if it isn’t going
to be useful? Because the truth has power not predicated on being useful. The truth has power,
which most people can’t see. You want to get this because Lucy’s question opens this up. The
truth has power, which you can’t see, because you’re only looking for what’s useful. You’re not
looking for power, you’re looking to exploit, to use, to consume. So you can’t see the power of the
truth. So Lucy, what I said was, that the truth has a power that, if you’re only looking for what
you can use, you can’t see. That’s why we had that whole thing about empty and meaningless.
LUCY
I can think of a way that “life being empty and meaningless” can be of use to us and giving us
power.
ERHARD (to the group)
Am I demonstrating my point?
LUCY
One of the many alternatives I can think of...
ERHARD (to the group)
You want to listen to this.
LUCY
I think it revolves around the issue of performance versus expectation and if we tell ourselves
often enough that life is empty and meaningless, our expectations as a consequence would be
set lower over time, potentially...
ERHARD
No.
LUCY
And performance of life relative to expectations, could make us...
ERHARD
That’s wonderful. You ought to do a seminar on that. People would buy that. Look, they bought
thinking positive big. Yeah, I expect there to be a seminar—if you don’t do it, somebody will. So
you ought to do it: The Empty and Meaningless seminar, the purpose of which is to lower your
expectations far enough down that anything feels like winning.
(applause and laughter)
You’re actually having fun with me, aren’t you? She doesn’t mean this, she’s only joking with
me. She’s kidding me. She’s not looking for the answer. She knows there’s no answer. She’s only
kidding with me.
“
...the truth has a power that, if you’re only
looking for what you can use, you can’t
see.

SPEAKING BEING
LUCY
Well, I disagree. I really do. Because I think everything is a state of mind.
ERHARD
Oh absolutely. You go out and tell the bus that. Lucy, you’ve been in too many success seminars.
Everything is not a state of mind. Buses are not a state of mind. I don’t care what anybody has
told you. And the evidence is all on my side.
(responding to a participant not on camera)
Excuse me?
(repeating thoughtfully what the participant said)
A new suit of clothes for the king. Yes. My tongue’s way more tied than yours is; you can’t out
tongue tie me. Yeah, I understand what you said. I was just trying to get it. Yeah, what about it?
(repeating what the participant said—who does not have a microphone)
Is that all in the mind?
(addressing himself out loud)
Let’s see, am I going to give him the truth or just shut him up?
(laughter)
It’s all in the mind.
(laughter. Then seriously)
To stop being a smart-ass about this, I will respond to you. Yes, it is what you and I ordinarily
call “in the mind,” but if we look a little closer, it is not in the mind, it was in the mouth. A suit
of clothes is a conversation, not a mental image. But that is a fi ne point and your point is valid.
Buses are not a suit of clothes, right? It’s not all in the mind.  A lot of people think buses are in
the mind. And they look like they’ve been hit by buses.
(to Lucy)
You all done?
LUCY
Yes, I’m done.
ERHARD
Okay great!
(applause as Lucy sits )
Forum Day Three: Session Four
307
ERHARD
Okay, there’s a certain part of The Forum for which you need to be less tired. I didn’t say not
tired. I said less tired, less tired than you’re going to be if I answer all your questions!
(laughter)
So we’re not going to answer any more questions tonight. Tonight we’re going to...
(after a participant shouted out: “Let’s vote.”)
Does it really make you feel good to vote?
(laughter)
What about “The rug is red? Yeah!”
(laughter)
If you like voting why don’t you vote on stuff  like that? “Yeah! This rug is red! Yeah!”
(clapping with everyone else joining in)
So, we’re not going to keep you up with answering questions, we’re going to keep you up with
an assignment. Stay up at home.
KIPP
Between tonight and tomorrow morning your assignment is to get clear that life is empty and
meaningless. So what you’re going to come up against between tonight and tomorrow morning
is all those places that you say have...
(the group shouts back: “meaning”)
And you’re going to inquire into those to see that they are...
(the group shouts: “meaningless”)
ERHARD
One other thing is to look at where they’ve made it mean something that life is empty and
meaningless. Particularly add that in there.
KIPP
The second part: what you’ve made it mean that life is empty and meaningless. Therefore...
There is also an invitation: to share what’s been opening up for you with people in your life. Get
clear that life is empty and meaningless. And what have you made it mean that life is empty
and meaningless?
The third day of The Forum concluded.
308
SPEAKING BEING
The Forgetting of Being, Part Six of Eight: Saying Nothing
The bundle of concepts associated with non-Being and the negative—emptiness,
meaninglessness, nothingness, nihilism—are of central significance in understand-
ing the rhetorical movement of The Forum. They are likewise fundamental in the
work of Martin Heidegger; and are deeply embedded in the perspective of Zen, an-
other major influence on Werner Erhard’s thinking. According to the Japanese schol-
ar Masao Abe, who has written extensively about the relationship of Zen to Western
thinking, “Martin Heidegger takes the issue of ‘nothingness’ not only with utmost
seriousness, but perhaps with the most profundity in Western history” (Maseo Abe,
Zen and Western Thought 134). For both Heidegger and Erhard, a transformative
ontological event—an experience of Being (of what it means “to be”)—demands an
authentic encounter with Being’s other side; and a conversation that aims to evoke
such an encounter makes special demands, since, says Heidegger, “there is, aft er all,
something peculiar about Nothing” (IM 30).
We cannot overstate the importance of this element in Erhard’s work. Central to
his achievement has been the development of a rhetorical structure—manifested in
both the est Training and The Forum—that consistently provides participants with
an experience of nothingness as a liberating context for their lives. The experience
is evoked by a progression of ontological distinctions, generated in speaking by
the Forum leader and developed dialogically with the participants. What is made
present in the dialogue—heard, though unsaid—is Being; and its presencing occurs
in a particularly dramatic way. One of Heidegger’s central claims is that an experi-
ence of Being must be preceded by an experience of Being’s other side, nonbeing,
which Heidegger called the Nothing. Human existence, he says, means “being held
out into the nothing” (“WM” in BW 103). This requires that one open oneself to an
experience of meaninglessness, an experience that one may encounter in moments
of anxiety, despair, or profound boredom—moments when the meaning of life drops
away, and one confronts existence nakedly, without the familiar comforts of one’s
personal identity. Human beings, says Erhard, are addicted to their identities, and
an addiction cannot be dealt with eff ectively until the addict has “hit bottom.” But
for Forum participants, most of whom have achieved a comfortable level of personal
and professional success, such an experience may never arise—without assistance.
Therefore the function of The Forum is to “raise the bottom” so that participants hit
it; and where this happens is in the confrontation with the Nothing, as the conversa-
tion’s penultimate distinction.
END OF DAY THREE INTERVAL
In Heidegger’s work, of course, the distinctions are presented in writing. While
many of his published works were originally delivered as lectures, and although
he is reported to have been exceptionally dynamic in their delivery, there is little
evidence that dialogue was an element of his pedagogy; and in the cultural context
in which he worked, certainly nothing like the personal interactions of The Forum
would have been possible (see the sidebar “Heidegger’s Pedagogy,” in Session Two
of Day Two).
But consider: while Heidegger’s collected works include 102 volumes, he is gen-
erally acknowledged to have been single-minded in his exploration of one question:
the question of Being and its meaning. As he wrote in 1947, “To think is to confine
yourself to a single thought that one day stands still like a star in the world’s sky”
(“TP” in PLT 4)
T
. Significantly, a few pages later we find: “What is spoken is never, and
in no language, what is said” (“TP” in PLT 11).
T
In Heidegger’s writing, then, the distinctions that he created to speak Being are
generated and communicated in the unspoken/unwritten background. There is, we
propose, a central encompassing distinction—the Distinction—that is hinted at by all
of the distinctions, a “single thought” that remains unspoken and the Same through
all of the turns and evolutions of his thinking. The rubrics for the various distinc-
tions that comprise the Distinction, such as the Same, the they-self, and the Nothing,
occur repeatedly throughout his work as he opens new ways into the distinctions,
beginning from diff erent originating terms. In an essay from a collection entitled
Holzwege (“Woodpaths”), Heidegger wrote this:
“
“Wood” is an old name for forest. In the wood are paths
that mostly wind along until they end quite suddenly in an
impenetrable thicket. They are called woodpaths. Each goes
its particular way, but in the same forest. Oft en it seems as
though one were identical to another. Yet it only seems so.
Woodcutters and foresters are familiar with these paths. They
know what it means to be on a woodpath. (Quoted in Krell,
“Introduction,” BW 34)
W
For the authors of this book, our experience of Werner Erhard’s work has enabled
us in negotiating the “impenetrable thickets” of Heidegger’s writing—if not with the
skill of woodcutters, at least with the sense that we are always on a way.
Krell comments that in Germany, “to be on a woodpath” means to be in a cul-
de-sac, a path that leads nowhere and has no exit. As an analogy for the rhetorical
strategies we find in the work of Werner Erhard, the “no exit” image is of interest.
Forum Day Three: End of Day Three Interval 309
Throughout this book, we are proposing that both Heidegger and Erhard make
important use of reflexive languaging—ideas presented in such a way that they turn
thinking back upon itself, pulling the rug out from under the reader or the listener
(e.g., “This statement is false”). We suggest that the reflexive impulse (reflex, reflec-
tion, self-referentiality, getting the joke) pervades the thinking and the languaging
of both men, most dramatically when they are saying the Nothing. These reflexive
processes share a particular aff inity with the movement of thinking that makes
available an experience of Being, and one view is that they evoke a cul-de-sac.
At a debriefing meeting between sessions of the 1989 Forum, Erhard told The
Forum leaders that the “critical condition of satisfaction” for doing The Forum is
that for the participants it must be inescapable. That is, in Heidegger’s terms, all
exits by which the they-self might escape an authentic confrontation with its own
thrownness must be closed. To this end, a cul-de-sac may be a useful model; and
The Forum’s culminating distinction (as well as the final process of the est Training)
t
may be seen as eff ective speaking of that form.
The French existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre evoked the cul-de-sac image in the
title of his play, No Exit; and one of Heidegger’s most important essays, published in
1947 as the “Letter On Humanism,” was written, in part, as a response to an essay
by Sartre. A comparison of Sartre’s thinking with Heidegger’s is beyond the scope of
this book, but we will gloss the diff erence in this way: for neither man is there an exit
from the trap of the human situation; but for Heidegger, the appropriation of that
situation—the appropriation of entrapment—creates the possibility of authentic
entrapment. The situation becomes the Situation, which gives releasement.  ■
Forum Day Four: Session One
311
When the fi nal day of The Forum began at 9:00 am, Kipp was at the front of the room. As soon as
participants were seated, Kevin, the man who Erhard accused of being stingy, recommending that
he ask his wife about that, walked up onto the platform and handed a piece of paper to Kipp, who
then read it to the group. It was a signed video release form. The participants stood to applaud at
length.
KIPP
That’s exactly what’s going to be required in your lives, to have something beyond what the
past has given you to happen. What you just saw was an act of something beyond being stingy,
something beyond what the past has given him. And like Kevin, you’re attached. It doesn’t take
much to get you deeply rooted in what you are attached to. I think what just struck a chord for
you was to see someone go beyond what life has given them. That’s what it’s going to take to go
beyond what life has given you: all day every day. That’s the choice you’re going to have.
(to Kevin)
Kevin, I appreciate your courage.
(to the group)
Sharing about the empty and meaninglessness that life is, or the meaning that you made of
empty and meaningless.
MARGARET
The only place where empty and meaningless is meaningful, is where it coincides with my
racket, the only hitch is in there... This morning I called someone I’m engaged to...
KIPP  (interrupting)
That was a quick sentence: “the only place where empty and meaningless means something is
where it coincides with my racket”—that’s the part you got to get. You see, where your racket
is, no one dares to tread.
(laughter; to Margaret)
Yes?
MARGARET
My racket is: “I can’t quite have it... I can’t quite have it all.” It’s a joke. It’s such a joke. But I do
run it with a real verve and panache and other words that go with it. I called a former... well I
was engaged to marry him for a year and a half...
KIPP
So it’s perfect. Someone who “can’t quite have it all” gets engaged for a year and a half...
(laughter)
And not married.
SPEAKING
BEING
DAY FOUR
FORUM DAY FOUR:
SESSION ONE
312
SPEAKING BEING
Being-in-the-World: World
The Forum promises participants a transformed perspective
on their lives, which is to say their Being-in-the-world. Martin
Heidegger hyphenated this phrase in his writing to indicate that
the phenomenon must be seen as a whole, as a unitary structure.
However, he said, its parts could be considered separately for
emphasis. Previously, in Session One of Day One, we examined
Being-in, and in Session One of Day Two, Being-with. Here we
consider Heidegger’s view of world.
Inside/Outside
In the Cartesian model of reality, the model that for the most part
determines the way contemporary human beings understand our
relation to the world, knowledge arises from an encounter between
subject and object: the “I”—the human subject, the being that
knows—encounters and comes to know the objects, and thus the
world.
Martin Heidegger’s model of human being as Dasein
challenges this tradition: Dasein and its world do not correspond
to subject and object (BT 87). Knowledge, in the sense that Dasein
T
knows the world, does not result from a human subject’s coming
to understand an objective world separate from itself.
For Heidegger, the assumptions of the Cartesian model were
problematic. That model presupposes that reality consists of an
“outer” realm (that which becomes known, Nature, the objective
world), and a separate “inner” realm of subjectivity that does the
knowing. This inner realm is in some way distinct from the outer
realm that contains everything else; but it is somehow able to
escape its inner realm so that it can get outside and, well, know.
The problem of inner and outer, and the search for a proof
of the “Dasein of things outside me,” has concerned philosophy
since Descartes. But, says Heidegger, if there is such a problem, it
lies with the question itself.
MARGARET  (continuing to laugh)
h
...and I shared my racket with him and I said “and furthermore, it’s your racket, too!” It was so
freeing. I mean it was so great to be straight with him. I said “You keep me around. Our sex wasn’t
that great, so you keep me massaging your racket every now and again. You liked that better
than me massaging your penis.” I mean I was able to be so straight with him. “You want me to
massage your case and you didn’t want anything else. And same with me: I have you buy me off
every once and a while. You buy me wonderful gifts. It’s exactly what we’ve always wanted!”
(laughter)
So that was that on that, and I just noticed...
(more laughter)
And he said, “You mean behind that, I don’t really want a relationship?” and I said, “You
should move to California to be with me...”
(laughter)
There was no hook to it anymore. But I run it with everybody, that my life isn’t quite right. I
started dating some great guys about four months ago. Really great guys, but it can’t be that
great. I’m a runner and hurt my leg, and so I’ve gained a little weight, and so now I’ve got that
schtick going: I can’t not have a schtick about things not being quite right. It’s disgusting! You
know, I never have to be responsible for producing at the level of who I am for my job, ever.
Someone can’t stab into me because they know how much I’ve already sacrifi ced.
KIPP
This is an important part because: some of you are successful and the success keeps the wolves
off  your back. The results are part of the racket, and that’s why there’s no satisfaction in them.
The results are there to avoid the domination; they are not results that leave you satisfi ed, no,
they are there to avoid the responsibility of ever really being responsible. “Don’t touch me,
because I’m the best you’ve got.”
MARGARET
Right. It’s horrible. Yeah, and I see the only way to do it is to state that I’m full of it, and “You
can hold me to account, whether I don’t like it, whether I get snarly, hold me to account.” You
know, my life is brilliant, it works, I’ve got the best life there could be. I really do. And yet I run
this racket as good as anyone. Better.
(laughter)
And then I noticed, where are the miracles? Well, this morning I went for a run and it was
eff ortless! I should have been late with all that I did this morning, but I was on time. I stopped
eating last night when I was full. I even made my deep, profound commitment to ending hun-
ger on the planet into an in-order-to, an in-order-to be liked, to make it, and to sacrifi ce: “oh
woe is me.” And that’s ridiculous.
KIPP  (applause as Margaret sits
(
)s
Thank you very much.
Forum Day Four: Session One
313
ELYSE
I started to feel sick yesterday, and I wondered what was wrong with me that I was sick, and
I’m not supposed to be sick. I could hardly sit in the room last night. During the break last
night we went out for dinner, and I thought “I better go lay down for a while, otherwise I’m not
going to be able to make it, I’m not going to be able to pay attention to what’s happening, I’m
not going to be able to do it.” And I couldn’t see what I couldn’t be with, and fi nally it struck
me. What I couldn’t be with is—because I’d been thinking: “what’s my racket?” I thought that
my racket was that I couldn’t be with how much people loved me because I was afraid that
people didn’t love me, and I saw that that wasn’t my racket at all. My racket is that I’ve had no
capacity to be with how much I love people and express that. I’ve said it like a concept, and I
have to do things in order to express my love for people rather than “be” my love for people.
And I still feel sick, and I have an incredible life and I can hardly be with that.
KIPP
Well, it makes you wrong.
MARGARET
Yes, absolutely. It’s amazing. I wake up every morning and I think, “this isn’t my life, this is
someone else’s life. Somebody’s going to fi nd out about me and they’re going to pull the rug,
and it’s not going to be there anymore, and it’s all going to be fucked.”
KIPP
Well, it already is.
(laughter)
See, if you recall the conversation we started having last night, the clearing that it is to be a
human being that you live in: “there’s something wrong.”
MARGARET
There is. Absolutely.
KIPP
Yeah. And it’s not conceptual. You are “there’s something wrong.” You’ve also made that mean
something. Not only is something wrong, it means something that there’s something wrong.
MARGARET
It shouldn’t be that way.
KIPP
What else?
The ‘scandal of philosophy’ is not that this
proof has yet to be given, but that such proofs
are expected and attempted again and again.
[. . .] If Dasein is understood correctly, it defies
such proofs, because, in its Being, it already
is what subsequent proofs deem necessary to
demonstrate for it. (BT 249
T
)
“
That is, one always knows the world from the position of already
being out there in it.
When Dasein directs itself toward something
and grasps it, it does not somehow first get
out of an inner sphere in which it has been
proximally encapsulated, but its primary
kind of Being is such that it is always ‘outside’
alongside entities which it encounters and
s
which belong to a world already discovered.
(BT 89, emphasis added
T
)
“
On the other hand, there is certainly a sense in which we are
inside:
[E]ven in this ‘being-outside’ alongside
the object, Dasein is still ‘inside,’ if we
understand this in the correct sense; that is
to say, it is itself ‘inside’ as a Being-in-the-
world which knows. And furthermore, the
perceiving of what is known is not a process
of returning with one’s booty to the ‘cabinet’
of consciousness aft er one has gone out and
grasped it; even in perceiving, retaining, and
preserving, the Dasein which knows remains
outside, and does so as Dasein. (BT 89
T
)
“
So the inside/outside dilemma is a false problem. Human beings
know their world through existing in it and coping with it.
314
SPEAKING BEING
MARGARET
Well I can see that it doesn’t mean anything and then I woke up this morning and I thought,
well then I shouldn’t be upset that I didn’t feel good, or that my throat hurts, or that my head
hurts.
KIPP
This is very good now. This is the giving meaning to no meaning. See “If it doesn’t mean any-
thing, therefore, in order to...”
MARGARET
Or if I really got it, I wouldn’t be sick.
KIPP
Right.
MARGARET
I don’t even know if I’m sick. Truth is, I don’t even know.
KIPP
Right. Well, for sure you’d be some other way than you are.
MARGARET
I’m kind of like backed into a corner. I can’t talk about it, so now I should feel a diff erent way
than I feel physically. Which is crazy.
KIPP
No it’s not crazy, it’s called normal. This is normal.
MARGARET
I got it.
KIPP
This is what everybody walks around in every day.
MARGARET
And I also see: I’ve designed my entire life to be protected from anyone fi nding out that that’s so
about me. I’ll produce great, unbelievable results; I’ll create great things around me so that people
won’t fi nd out. It’s so fucking elaborate! People won’t fi nd out about me that all I’m petrifi ed of is
that people don’t love me.
KIPP
You know, I think that we think it’s elaborate. We walk around every day with these signs on
telling everybody exactly the way it is with us.
Circumspection
Heidegger also points out that this antecedent understanding
of the world has a particular quality. The things with which we
concern ourselves in our everyday world are the things that we
use in the business of living. Encountered this way, they are the
material of a phenomenological knowing—a knowing that grows
l
out of Being (BT 95). This knowing may or may not be explicit in
T
our awareness:
How do the beings with which we dwell show
themselves to us primarily and for the most
part? Sitting here in the auditorium we do
not in fact apprehend walls—not unless we
are getting bored. Nevertheless, the walls
are already present before we think them as
objects. (BPP 163
P
)
“
Before they are objects for us, the walls are present as a part of
the equipmental context. In a knowing that arises from Being, I am
not immediately present to the things in my world in the role of
contemplator, one who seeks to understand and describe them.
Rather I encounter and use them in the business of living:
The nearest things that surround us we call
equipment. There is always already a manifold
of equipment: equipment for working, for
traveling, for measuring, and in general things
with which we have to do. (BPP 163
P
)
“
Forum Day Four: Session One
315
MARGARET
That obvious, right?
KIPP
It’s that obvious for everybody, isn’t it, except you walk around like it’s not that obvious.
MARGARET
Well, for me it’s never lived like that. It’s always been that I’ve had to make sure it was fl awless,
to cover all the little seams up, so people wouldn’t fi nd out.
KIPP
Wouldn’t fi nd out?
MARGARET
That I was afraid that people wouldn’t love me, and the one I was hiding most from is me, or
that I love people. It sounds like such a stupid thing to say. That I walked around like I was a
machine. I’ve been like a machine.
KIPP
What do you mean by that?
MARGARET
Well, like... the easiest way I can say it is I had no right to be. I was always trying to get some-
where or do something.
KIPP
Yeah, but what I’m saying is that’s a little conceptual... I don’t hear you sharing yet.
MARGARET (after a long pause)
Okay. I called my mother. I was very upset with my mother, because I just got married a month
ago. She didn’t want to come to my wedding.
KIPP
No no. She didn’t want to come to the wedding or she didn’t come to the wedding.
MARGARET
She didn’t come to the wedding. But I had it that she didn’t want to come to my wedding and it
meant all these things.
KIPP
It meant?
How do I understand these things?
The view in which the equipmental contexture
stands at first, completely unobtrusive
and unthought, is the view and sight of
practical circumspection, of our practical
everyday orientation. “Unthought” means
that it is not thematically apprehended for
deliberate thinking about things; instead,
in circumspection we find our bearings in
regard to them. Circumspection uncovers and
understands things primarily as equipment.
[. . .] We say that an equipmental contexture
environs us. (BPP 163, emphasis added
P
)
“
I can of course assume a detached role in relation to the world,
taking on understanding as a science, or an intellectual task to be
accomplished. But this always happens against the background
of the world I already know from being in it. The background
understanding comes first.
World is not something subsequent that
we calculate as a result from the sum of all
beings. The world comes not aft erward but
beforehand, in the strict sense of the word.
[. . .] The world as already unveiled in advance
is such that we do not in fact specifically
occupy ourselves with it, or apprehend it, but
instead it is so self-evident, so much a matter
of course, that we are completely oblivious to
it. (BPP 165
P
)
“
It is, in a metaphor often employed by Werner Erhard, like water to
a fish: fundamental to existence, yet unavailable to our purview.
We see the beings within that purview—they occur as extant, which
for Heidegger means that they occur as substantial things in the
world.
316
SPEAKING BEING
MARGARET
She didn’t love me. “What’s wrong with me that she didn’t want to come to my wedding? How
could that be?” And you know it was funny because when she fi rst told me—that she wasn’t
coming to my wedding—it was fi ne. At fi rst I got it, and then I had it mean something.
KIPP
So what it means that your mother wasn’t coming to your wedding is...
MARGARET
She wasn’t coming to my wedding.
KIPP
“My mother’s not coming to my wedding.”
MARGARET
And then I had it mean something.
KIPP
You had it mean what?
MARGARET
First it meant that there was something wrong with me that she wasn’t coming to my wedding.
If I wasn’t the way I was, she would come to my wedding. There was something wrong with
me. And then I had it mean that she didn’t love me.
KIPP
Which means that there’s something wrong with her.
MARGARET
Right.
KIPP
Everybody know that’s the next step after there’s something wrong with you? There’s some-
thing wrong with them.
MARGARET
And then um, you know, I called her during the couple months before I got married and I
would talk to her, and I could see that when I started to have that she wasn’t coming to my
wedding means something, all I could do was talk to her as an in-order-to: in order to get her
to come to my wedding; in order to get her to love me. I even went from, “if she’s not going to
come to my wedding, the least she could do was tell me that she loves me.” And it was just... It’s
funny, because I just called her up, two days ago during a break, and I said to her, “I just called
But the world itself is of a different order of being. The
world itself occurs as Dasein does; and Da-Sein, remember,
is both Being-there and, for Heidegger Being-a-clearing. The
phenomenon is like nothing we are accustomed to thinking; thus
Heidegger’s presentation of the situation is provocative:
The world is not the sum total of extant
entities. It is, quite generally, not extant at all.
It is a determination of [B]eing-in-the-world, a
moment in the structure of the Dasein’s mode
of being. The world is something Dasein-ish, It
is not extant like things but it is da, there-here,
like the Dasein, the being-da [das Da-sein]
which we ourselves are: that is to say, it exists.
(BPP 166
P
)
“
The world, then, may be seen as a clearing where things can occur
meaningfully. This is also a working definition of human being:
the clearing in the world for meaning. Both definitions direct us
to a distinction, a distinction that hints at the unspoken realm of
world.
World-understanding as Dasein-understanding
is self-understanding. Self and world belong
together in the single entity, the Dasein. Self
and world are not two beings, like subject and
object, or like I and thou, but self and world
are the basic determination of the Dasein itself
in the unity of the structure of [B]eing-in-the-
world. (BPP 297
P
)
“
The transformational power of The Forum arises from its evocation
of that unity. ■
Forum Day Four: Session One

to let you know that...I just called to say hello.” We just kind of talked. And she told me what
was going on with her. I told her that our wedding was great and that I got back great pictures
from the photographer, that I couldn’t wait to show them to her, that I really love her. She said
to me, well, I said to her that I don’t know how to create a relationship, or how to have a kind
of relationship that works for you. I keep trying to do something and I haven’t been doing any-
thing that’s really worked. “All I’ve done is fi gured out what was wrong with you or what was
wrong with me and try to tell you that, and make you do something diff erent.” And she said
to me, “just be yourself.” You know, it was really remarkable. Because whatever she’s going
through she’s going through. And my father just died and she told me that, you know, she just
shared with me a little bit about that...
KIPP
She said?
MARGARET
She said: “It’s tough and I don’t know how I’m going to get over it and what I’m going to do.”
And I also saw... My mother and my brothers have been saying to me: “You don’t live in the
same city we do, you can’t have the same kind of relationship we have with each other.” And
I saw that she’s upset that I don’t live where she lives. I’ve never heard it like that before. So
we just had a conversation where there was no sting anymore. There was no more me trying
to get her to do something. It was a conversation where we were actually talking to each other
instead of me trying to get her to do something. And it’s a beginning. And I also said to her that
all I was committed to was that she really, you know, have her life work for her. And I had no
idea what that was going to be and she didn’t either. It was really a beginning, a place to talk
to each other from. And I saw I wasn’t trying to get her to do something. So however I hung
up the phone, I was satisfi ed, and however way I’ve been operating never left me satisfi ed in
talking to her.
KIPP
Anything else?
MARGARET
One of the things I came to The Forum to get is a way of working with the people I work with
that I don’t live like some special unique human being, but really able to contribute whatever
distinctions are clear to me to them so that they can get done whatever I can get done. And I
can see, who I’d have... I have no idea how to do it and actually live like a possibility for me,
inside my relationship with the people I work with, rather than something I’m supposed to do,
someway I have to be in order to make it. And how I’ve been... when I couldn’t be with some-
thing I didn’t know how to do, or continuing to stand in the face of not knowing how to deliver
on all the work that we’ve got, not knowing how to do that. What I do is I use force instead of
being able to be with whatever’s happening.

روز اول انجمن: جلسه چهارم

خوب خواهد بود شما می دانید که چگونه خواهد بود؟ درست مثل این بله ، درست نخواهد بود اینگونه خواهد بود شما یا می خواهید مانند این درست کنید یا نمی خواهید آن را بسازید. شما یا یاد می گیرید که در زندان باشید یا فقط ناراضی خواهید بود. شما قرار است باشید
در زندان به یک روش یا دیگری. بنابراین ، چرا ما در مورد خالی و بی معنی صحبت کردیم اگر این کار نباشد
مفید بودن؟ از آنجا که حقیقت قدرت مفید بودن را ندارد. حقیقت قدرت دارد ،
که اکثر مردم نمی توانند ببینند. شما می خواهید این را بدست آورید زیرا سوال لوسی این مسئله را باز می کند. در
حقیقت دارای قدرت است ، که نمی توانید ببینید ، زیرا شما فقط به دنبال آنچه مفید است. شما نیستید
به دنبال قدرت ، به دنبال بهره برداری ، استفاده ، مصرف هستید. بنابراین شما نمی توانید قدرت را ببینید
حقیقت. بنابراین لوسی ، آنچه من گفتم این بود که حقیقت قدرت دارد که اگر فقط به دنبال چه چیزی هستید
می توانید استفاده کنید ، نمی توانید ببینید. به همین دلیل ما همه چیز را در مورد خالی و بی معنی داشتیم. لوسی
من می توانم به روشی فکر کنم که "زندگی خالی و بی معنی باشد" می تواند برای ما استفاده کند و به ما بدهد
قدرت erhard (به گروه)
آیا من نظر خود را نشان می دهم؟ لوسی
یکی از گزینه های زیادی که می توانم به آن فکر کنم ... erhard (به گروه)
شما می خواهید به این گوش دهید. لوسی
من فکر می کنم حول مسئله عملکرد در مقابل انتظار می چرخد ​​و اگر خودمان را بگوییم
اغلب به اندازه کافی که زندگی خالی و بی معنی باشد ، انتظارات ما در نتیجه خواهد بود
با گذشت زمان پایین تر ، به طور بالقوه ... erhard
شماره لوسی
و عملکرد زندگی نسبت به انتظارات ، می تواند ما را ... erhard کند
این فوق العاده است شما باید یک سمینار در این باره انجام دهید. مردم آن را می خریدند. ببین ، آنها خریدند
فکر کردن مثبت بله ، من انتظار دارم که یک سمینار وجود داشته باشد - اگر این کار را نکنید ، کسی چنین خواهد کرد. اینقدر
شما باید آن را انجام دهید: سمینار خالی و بی معنی ، هدف از آن پایین آمدن شما است
انتظارات به اندازه کافی پایین که هر چیزی مانند پیروزی احساس می شود. (تشویق و خنده)
شما واقعاً با من سرگرم می شوید ، مگر نه؟ منظور او این نیست ، او فقط با او شوخی می کند
من او به من شوخی می کند. او به دنبال جواب نیست. او می داند که هیچ جوابی وجود ندارد. او فقط است
شوخی با من "
... حقیقت قدرت دارد که اگر فقط باشید
به دنبال آنچه می توانید استفاده کنید ، نمی توانید
ببینید 306
وجود
لوسی
خوب ، من مخالفم. من واقعاً این کار را می کنم از آنجا که من فکر می کنم همه چیز یک حالت ذهن است. درز
اوه کاملا شما بیرون می روید و به اتوبوس می گویید که. لوسی ، شما در سمینارهای موفقیت آمیز بسیار زیاد بوده اید. همه چیز یک حالت ذهنی نیست. اتوبوس ها حالت ذهنی نیستند. من اهمیتی نمی دهم که کسی چه کسی دارد
به شما گفت و شواهد همه در کنار من است. (پاسخ به یک شرکت کننده نه در دوربین)
ببخشید؟ (تکرار فکر آنچه شرکت کننده گفت)
کت و شلوار جدیدی از لباس برای پادشاه. بله راه زبان من بیشتر از شما گره خورده است ؛ شما نمی توانید بیرون
زبان من را می بندد. بله ، من می فهمم که شما چه گفتید. من فقط سعی می کردم آن را بدست آورم. بله ، در مورد آن چطور؟ (تکرار آنچه شرکت کننده گفت - که میکروفون ندارد)
آیا این همه در ذهن است؟ (خطاب به خودش با صدای بلند)
بیایید ببینیم ، آیا می خواهم حقیقت را به او بدهم یا فقط او را ببندم؟ (خنده)
این همه در ذهن است (خنده. سپس به طور جدی)
برای متوقف کردن الاغ هوشمند در این مورد ، من به شما پاسخ خواهم داد. بله ، این همان چیزی است که من و شما معمولاً
"در ذهن" تماس بگیرید ، اما اگر کمی نزدیکتر به نظر برسیم ، در ذهن نیست ، در دهان بود. یک کت و شلوار
لباس یک مکالمه است ، نه یک تصویر ذهنی. اما این یک نکته مهم است و نکته شما معتبر است. اتوبوس ها کت و شلوار لباس نیستند ، درست است؟ این همه در ذهن نیست بسیاری از مردم فکر می کنند اتوبوس ها در آن قرار دارند
ذهن و به نظر می رسد که توسط اتوبوس ها مورد اصابت قرار گرفته اند. (به لوسی)
همه شما انجام دادید؟ لوسی
بله ، من تمام شده ام. درز
خوب عالی! (تشویق به عنوان لوسی نشسته)
روز اول انجمن: جلسه چهارم
307
درز
خوب ، بخش خاصی از انجمن وجود دارد که برای آن باید کمتر خسته شوید. من نگفتم
خسته اگر من به تمام سوالات شما پاسخ می دهم ، کمتر خسته ام ، کمتر خسته از شما خسته شده ام! (خنده)
بنابراین ما امشب نمی خواهیم به سؤال دیگری پاسخ دهیم. امشب ما می خواهیم ... (بعد از اینکه یک شرکت کننده فریاد زد: "بیایید رأی دهیم.")
آیا واقعاً باعث می شود احساس رأی گیری خوبی داشته باشید؟ (خنده)
در مورد "فرش قرمز است؟ بله!"
(خنده)
اگر دوست دارید رأی دهید چرا به مواردی از این دست رای نمی دهید؟ "بله! این فرش قرمز است! بله!"
(کف زدن با هر کس دیگری که به آن بپیوندند)
بنابراین ، ما نمی خواهیم شما را با پاسخ دادن به سؤالات حفظ کنیم ، ما قصد داریم شما را از این کار دور کنیم
تکلیف در خانه بمانید. کله
بین امشب و فردا صبح وظیفه شما این است که روشن شوید که زندگی خالی است و
بی معنی بنابراین آنچه شما می خواهید بین امشب و فردا صبح با آن روبرو شوید
آیا همه مکانهایی که شما می گویید ... (گروه فریاد می زند: "معنی")
و شما می خواهید در مورد کسانی که می بینند سؤال کنید که آنها هستند ... (گروه فریاد می زند: "بی معنی")
درز
نکته دیگر این است که به جایی که آنها ساخته شده اند ، به معنای چیزی باشد که زندگی خالی است و
بی معنی به خصوص آن را در آنجا اضافه کنید. کله
بخش دوم: آنچه شما آن را ساخته اید به این معنی است که زندگی خالی و بی معنی است. بنابراین ... یک دعوت نیز وجود دارد: برای به اشتراک گذاشتن آنچه در زندگی شما برای شما باز شده است. بدست آوردن
روشن است که زندگی خالی و بی معنی است. و آنچه را ساخته اید به این معنی است که زندگی خالی است
و بی معنی؟ روز سوم انجمن به پایان رسید. 308
وجود
فراموشی بودن بودن ، قسمت ششم از هشت: گفتن هیچی
مجموعه مفاهیم مرتبط با عدم تحمل و منفی بودن-
بی معنی ، هیچ چیز ، نیهیلیسم- از اهمیت اصلی در درک-
حرکت بلاغی انجمن. آنها به همین ترتیب در
کار مارتین هایدگر ؛ و عمیقاً در چشم انداز ذن تعبیه شده اند ،
تأثیر عمده دیگر در تفکر ورنر ارهارد. طبق دانشکده ژاپنی-
AR Masao Abe ، که به طور گسترده در مورد رابطه ذن با وسترن نوشت
فکر می کنم ، "مارتین هایدگر مسئله" هیچ چیز "را نه تنها با حداکثر می گیرد
جدی بودن ، اما شاید با عمیق ترین در تاریخ غربی »(ماسئو آبه ،
ذن و فکر غربی 134). برای هایدگر و ارهارد ، یک تحول پذیر
رویداد هستی شناختی - تجربه ای از بودن (از آنچه که "بودن" است) - خواستار یک است
برخورد معتبر با طرف مقابل بودن ؛ و مکالمه ای که هدفش آن است
هایدگر می گوید ، چنین برخوردی خواسته های ویژه ای را مطرح می کند ، "همه چیز وجود دارد ،
چیزی عجیب در مورد هیچ چیز "(IM 30). ما نمی توانیم اهمیت این عنصر را در کار Erhard بیش از حد بیش از حد کنیم.
دستاورد وی توسعه یک ساختار بلاغی بوده است -
هم آموزش EST و هم انجمن - که به طور مداوم شرکت کنندگان را در اختیار شما قرار می دهد
تجربه ای از هیچ چیز به عنوان یک زمینه آزاد کننده برای زندگی آنها. تجربه
با پیشرفت تمایزهای هستی شناختی برانگیخته می شود ، در صحبت کردن توسط
رهبر انجمن و با شرکت کنندگان به صورت دیالوگ توسعه یافته است. چه چیزی ساخته شده است
موجود در گفتگو - شنیدن ، هرچند ناگفته - موجود است. و حفظ آن رخ می دهد
به روشی خاص و چشمگیر. یکی از ادعاهای اصلی هایدگر این است که یک تجربه
قبل از این که باید از تجربه طرف مقابل بودن ، عدم وجود ، مقدم باشد.
که هایدگر آن را هیچی نامید. او می گوید ، وجود انسان به معنای "نگه داشتن" است
به هیچ چیز "(" Wm "در BW 103). این امر مستلزم آن است که فرد خود را به یک باز کند
تجربه بی معنی بودن ، تجربه ای که ممکن است در لحظه ها با آن روبرو شود
از اضطراب ، ناامیدی یا کسالت عمیق - وقتی معنی زندگی کاهش می یابد
دور ، و یکی با وجود برهنه ، بدون آسایش آشنای شخص مقابله می کند
هویت شخصی Erhard می گوید ، انسان به هویت خود معتاد است و
اعتیاد را نمی توان با نتیجه ای روبرو کرد تا زمانی که معتاد "به پایین" برخورد کند. اما
برای شرکت کنندگان در انجمن ، که بیشتر آنها به یک سطح شخصی راحت دست یافته اند
و موفقیت حرفه ای ، چنین تجربه ای ممکن است هرگز ایجاد نشود - بدون کمک. بنابراین عملکرد این انجمن "بالا بردن پایین" است تا شرکت کنندگان ضربه بزنند
آن و جایی که این اتفاق می افتد در تقابل با هیچ چیز است ، به عنوان مکالمه
تمایز پیش فرض Tion. پایان روز سه فاصله
در کار هایدگر ، البته ، تمایزها به صورت کتبی ارائه می شود. در حالی که
بسیاری از آثار منتشر شده وی در ابتدا به عنوان سخنرانی تحویل داده می شدند و اگرچه
گفته می شود که وی در تحویل آنها فوق العاده پویا بوده است ، کمی وجود دارد
شواهدی مبنی بر گفتگو عنصری از تعلیم و تربیت وی بود. و در زمینه فرهنگی
که در آن کار می کرد ، مطمئناً چیزی شبیه به تعامل شخصی انجمن نیست
ممکن بود (در جلسه دو ، به نوار کناری "آموزش هایدگر" مراجعه کنید
روز دوم). اما در نظر بگیرید: در حالی که آثار جمع آوری شده هایدگر شامل 102 جلد است ، او ژنرال است
به طور کلی اذعان می شود که در کاوش در مورد یک سوال مجرد بوده است:
سوال وجود و معنی آن. همانطور که در سال 1947 نوشت ، "فکر کردن برای محدود کردن است
خودتان به یک فکر واحد که یک روز هنوز مانند یک ستاره در آسمان جهان می ایستد "
("TP" در PLT 4)
حرف
بشر نکته قابل توجه ، چند صفحه بعد متوجه می شویم: "آنچه گفته می شود هرگز نیست ، و
به هیچ زبانی ، آنچه گفته می شود "(" TP "در PLT 11).
بنابراین ، در نوشتن هایدگر ، تمایزاتی که او برای صحبت کردن ایجاد کرده است وجود دارد
در پس زمینه ناگفته/نانوشته ایجاد و ابلاغ شده است. ما هستیم ، ما
پیشنهاد ، یک تمایز شامل اصلی - تمایز - که توسط همه مورد توجه قرار می گیرد
از تفاوت ها ، "فکر مجرد" که ناگفته و یکسان است
همه نوبت ها و تحولات تفکر او. مقالات مختلف برای متمایز
مواردی که شامل تمایز است ، مانند همان ، آنها خود و هیچ چیز ،
به طور مکرر در طول کار خود اتفاق می افتد ، زیرا او راه های جدیدی را برای تمایزات باز می کند ،
شروع از اصطلاحات منشأ متفاوت. در مقاله ای از مجموعه ای با عنوان
Holzwege ("Woodpaths") ، هایدگر این را نوشت:
"
"چوب" یک نام قدیمی برای جنگل است. در چوب مسیرها وجود دارد
که بیشتر باد می شود تا اینکه کاملاً ناگهان در یک پایان یابد
ضخامت غیرقابل نفوذ. آنها را Woodpaths می نامند. هر کدام می رود
روش خاص آن ، اما در همان جنگل. به نظر می رسد
گرچه یکی با دیگری یکسان بود. با این حال فقط به نظر می رسد چوب های چوبی و جنگل ها با این مسیرها آشنا هستند. آنها
بدانید که به معنای بودن در یک چوب چوبی چیست. (به نقل از کرل ،
"مقدمه" ، BW 34)
حرف
برای نویسندگان این کتاب ، تجربه ما از کار ورنر ارهارد فعال شده است
ما در مذاکره در مورد "ضخامت های غیرقابل نفوذ" از نوشتن هایدگر - اگر نه
مهارت چوب چوب ، حداقل با این حس که ما همیشه در یک راه هستیم. کرل اظهار داشت که در آلمان ، "برای داشتن یک چوب"
de-sac ، مسیری که به هیچ کجا منتهی می شود و هیچ خروجی ندارد. به عنوان یک قیاس برای بلاغی
استراتژی هایی که در کار ورنر ارهارد می یابیم ، تصویر "بدون خروج" مورد توجه است. روز سهل انجمن: پایان روز سه فاصله 309
در طول این کتاب ، ما پیشنهاد می کنیم که هم هایدگر و هم ارهارد بسازند
استفاده مهم از زبان بازتابنده - Ideas به گونه ای ارائه شده
به خودش فکر می کند ، فرش را از زیر خواننده یا شنونده بیرون می کشد
(به عنوان مثال ، "این جمله نادرست است"). ما پیشنهاد می کنیم که انگیزه بازتابی (رفلکس ، بازتاب-
TION ، خود ارجاعی ، گرفتن شوخی) تفکر و زبان را فرا گرفته است
از بین هر دو مرد ، به طرز چشمگیری وقتی آنها نمی گویند هیچ چیز. این بازتابنده
فرآیندها با حرکت تفکر که ایجاد می کند ، یک رابطه خاص را به اشتراک می گذارد
تجربه موجود بودن در دسترس است و یک دیدگاه این است که آنها یک Cul-de-Sac را بیرون می کشند. در یک نشست دبورینگ بین جلسات مجمع 1989 ، ارهارد به
رهبران انجمن که "شرط بحرانی رضایت" برای انجام انجمن است
که برای شرکت کنندگان باید غیرقابل اجتناب باشد. این ، از نظر هایدگر ، همه است
خروجی که توسط آنها ممکن است از یک رویارویی معتبر با خود فرار کند
پرتاب باید بسته شود. برای این منظور ، یک cul-de-sac ممکن است یک مدل مفید باشد. وت
تمایز اوج این انجمن (و همچنین روند نهایی آموزش EST)
حرف
ممکن است به عنوان صحبت های مؤثر از آن شکل تلقی شود. اگزیستانسیالیست فرانسوی ژان پل سارتر تصویر Cul-de-Sac را در آن برانگیخت
عنوان نمایشنامه او ، بدون خروج ؛ و یکی از مهمترین مقاله هایدگر ، منتشر شده در
در سال 1947 به عنوان "نامه در مورد اومانیسم" ، تا حدودی به عنوان پاسخی به مقاله نوشته شده است
توسط سارتر مقایسه تفکر سارتر با هایدگر فراتر از محدوده است
این کتاب ، اما ما از این طریق تفاوت های مختلفی را براق خواهیم کرد. زیرا هیچ کس خروجی وجود ندارد
از دام وضعیت انسان ؛ اما برای هایدگر ، اختصاص آن
وضعیت - تخصیص گرفتاری - امکان معتبر را ایجاد می کند
گرفتاری اوضاع به اوضاع تبدیل می شود ، که باعث می شود که امکان پذیر باشد. ■
روز چهارم: جلسه یک
311
هنگامی که روز اول مجمع از ساعت 9 صبح آغاز شد ، کیپ در جلوی اتاق بود. به محض
شرکت کنندگان نشسته بودند ، کوین ، مردی که متهم به لک بودن متهم شد و این را توصیه می کرد
او از همسرش در این باره سؤال کرد ، روی سکو قدم زد و یک تکه کاغذ را به کیپ تحویل داد ، که
سپس آن را برای گروه بخوانید. این یک فرم انتشار ویدیویی امضا شده بود. شرکت کنندگان ایستادند تا در آن تشویق کنند
طول کله
این دقیقاً همان چیزی است که در زندگی شما لازم است ، چیزی فراتر از آنچه
گذشته به شما داده است که اتفاق بیفتد. آنچه شما فقط دیدید عملی فراتر از لکنت بودن بود ،
چیزی فراتر از آنچه گذشته به او داده است. و مانند کوین ، شما پیوست شده اید. این طول نمی کشد
چیزهای زیادی برای اینکه شما را عمیقاً در آنچه به آن وصل شده اید ریشه دهید. من فکر می کنم آنچه که فقط یک وتر برای آن ایجاد شده است
شما این بود که کسی فراتر از آنچه زندگی به آنها داده است فراتر رود. این همان چیزی است که می خواهد برود
فراتر از آنچه زندگی به شما داده است: تمام روز. این انتخابی است که می خواهید داشته باشید. (به کوین)
کوین ، من از شجاعت شما قدردانی می کنم. (به گروه)
به اشتراک گذاشتن در مورد خالی و بی معنی بودن زندگی ، یا معنایی که از آن ساخته اید
خالی و بی معنی. مارگارت
تنها مکانی که خالی و بی معنی است معنی دارد ، جایی است که همزمان با من است
راکت ، تنها مشکل در آنجا است ... امروز صبح با کسی تماس گرفتم که به او مشغول هستم ... کیپ (قطع)
این یک جمله سریع بود: "تنها مکانی که خالی و بی معنی به معنای چیزی است
جایی که همزمان با راکت من است " - این بخشی است که شما باید بدست آورید. می بینید ، جایی که راکت شما
است ، هیچ کس جرات نمی کند. (خنده ؛ به مارگارت)
بله؟ مارگارت
راکت من این است: "من کاملاً نمی توانم آن را داشته باشم ... من نمی توانم همه اینها را داشته باشم." این یک شوخی است این چنین شوخی است اما من انجام می دهم
آن را با یک Verve و Panache واقعی و کلمات دیگر که با آن همراه است اجرا کنید. من به سابق زنگ زدم ... خوب من
یک سال و نیم درگیر ازدواج با او بود ... کیپ
بنابراین عالی است کسی که "کاملاً نمی تواند همه چیز را داشته باشد" به مدت یک سال و نیم درگیر می شود ... (خنده)
و ازدواج نکرده است. صحبت

روز چهارم
روز چهارم انجمن:
جلسه یک
312
وجود
بودن در جهان: جهان
این انجمن به شرکت کنندگان یک دیدگاه دگرگون شده قول می دهد
در زندگی آنها ، یعنی گفتن بودن آنها در جهان است. مارتین
هایدگر این عبارت را در نوشتار خود نشان داد تا نشان دهد
این پدیده باید به عنوان یک کل ، به عنوان یک ساختار واحد دیده شود. با این حال ، وی گفت ، قطعات آن می تواند به طور جداگانه در نظر گرفته شود
تأکید پیش از این ، در جلسه اول روز اول ، ما را مورد بررسی قرار دادیم
حضور در آن ، و در جلسه یکی از روز دوم ، با حضور. اینجا ما
دیدگاه هایدگر را در مورد جهان در نظر بگیرید. داخل/بیرون
در الگوی دکارتی واقعیت ، مدلی که در بیشتر قسمت ها
نحوه درک انسانهای معاصر ما را تعیین می کند
رابطه با جهان ، دانش از برخورد بین
موضوع و موضوع: "من" - موضوع انسانی ، موجودی است
می داند:
جهان الگوی انسان مارتین هایدگر به عنوان داسین
این سنت را به چالش می کشد: داسین و دنیای آن مطابقت ندارند
به موضوع و شی (BT 87). دانش ، به این معنا که dasein
حرف
جهان را می شناسد ، ناشی از آمدن یک موضوع انسانی نیست
برای درک یک دنیای عینی جدا از خود. برای هایدگر ، فرضیات مدل دکارتی بود
مشکل ساز این مدل فرض می کند که واقعیت شامل یک است
قلمرو "بیرونی" (آنچه شناخته می شود ، طبیعت ، هدف
جهان) ، و یک قلمرو "درونی" جداگانه از ذهنیت که انجام می دهد
دانستن این قلمرو درونی به نوعی از بیرونی متمایز است
قلمرو که شامل همه چیز دیگر است. اما به نوعی قادر است
از قلمرو درونی خود فرار کنید تا بتواند به بیرون برود و خوب ، بدانید. مشکل درونی و بیرونی و جستجوی اثبات
از "Dasein of Things Outly Outly" ، مربوط به فلسفه است
از دکارت. اما ، هایدگر می گوید ، اگر چنین مشکلی وجود داشته باشد ،
با خود سوال دروغ می گوید. مارگارت (ادامه خندیدن)
سخنرانی
... و من راکت خود را با او به اشتراک گذاشتم و گفتم "و علاوه بر این ، این راکت شما نیز هست!" خیلی بود
آزاد کردن منظورم این است که خیلی مستقیم با او بودیم. من گفتم: "تو مرا نگه داری. جنس ما نبود
آن عالی ، بنابراین شما مرا به ماساژ دادن راکت خود را هر چند وقت یک بار نگه دارید. شما آن را بهتر دوست داشتید
از من آلت تناسلی شما را ماساژ می دهم. " منظورم این است که من توانستم با او خیلی مستقیم باشم.
پرونده خود را ماساژ دهید و چیز دیگری نمی خواهید. و با من هم همینطور: من مرا خریداری کرده ام
هر یکبار و یک بار شما هدایای فوق العاده ای برای من خریداری می کنید. این دقیقاً همان چیزی است که ما همیشه می خواستیم! "
(خنده)
این در مورد آن بود ، و من فقط متوجه شدم ... (خنده بیشتر)
و او گفت ، "منظور شما از این است ، من واقعاً رابطه ای نمی خواهم؟" و من گفتم ، "تو
باید به کالیفرنیا حرکت کند تا با من باشد ... "
(خنده)
دیگر هیچ قلاب به آن نبود. اما من آن را با همه اجرا می کنم ، که زندگی من کاملاً درست نیست. من
حدود چهار ماه پیش با برخی از بچه های بزرگ شروع به ملاقات کرد. واقعاً بچه های عالی ، اما نمی تواند اینگونه باشد
عالی من یک دونده هستم و پایم را آزار می دهم ، بنابراین کمی وزن پیدا کردم ، بنابراین اکنون آن را بدست آورده ام
Schtick Going: من نمی توانم در مورد درست بودن چیزهایی که کاملاً درست نیستند ، دچار مشکل شوم. منزجر کننده است! شما
بدانید ، من هرگز نباید مسئول تولید در سطح من برای شغل خود باشم. کسی نمی تواند به من چاقو بزند زیرا آنها می دانند که من قبلاً چقدر قربانی کرده ام. کله
این یک بخش مهم است زیرا: برخی از شما موفق هستید و موفقیت گرگ ها را حفظ می کند
از پشت خود نتایج بخشی از راکت است ، و به همین دلیل هیچ رضایت از آنها وجود ندارد. نتایج برای جلوگیری از سلطه وجود دارد. آنها نتیجه ای نیستند که شما را رضایت دهند ، نه ،
آنها در آنجا هستند تا از مسئولیت مسئولیت واقعی خودداری کنند. "مرا لمس نکن ،
از آنجا که من بهترین شما هستم. "
مارگارت
درست وحشتناک است بله ، و من تنها راه برای انجام این کار این است که بیان کنم که من از آن پر از آن هستم ، و "شما
می تواند من را به حساب بیاورد ، خواه من آن را دوست ندارم ، خواه خندوانه شوم ، مرا به حساب خود نگه دارم. " شما
بدانید ، زندگی من درخشان است ، کار می کند ، من بهترین زندگی در آنجا را دارم. من واقعاً این کار را می کنم و با این حال من دویدم
این راکت به اندازه هر کس خوب است. بهتر (خنده)
و بعد متوجه شدم که معجزات کجا هستند؟ خوب ، امروز صبح برای دویدن رفتم و بود
بی پروا! من باید با تمام کارهایی که امروز صبح انجام می دادم دیر می کردم ، اما به موقع بودم. متوقف شدم
شب گذشته وقتی پر شدم غذا می خورم. من حتی تعهد عمیق و عمیق خود را برای پایان دادن به شکار انجام دادم
Ger on the Planet in-in-to ، یک مرتبه را دوست داشته باشید ، آن را بسازید ، و به قربانی می پردازید: "اوه
وای من هستم. " و این مسخره است.

خیلی ممنون روز چهارم: جلسه یک
313
الیز
من دیروز احساس بیماری کردم و تعجب کردم که چه مشکلی با من وجود دارد که بیمار هستم و
من قرار نیست بیمار باشم. دیشب به سختی می توانستم در اتاق بنشینم. در طول استراحت آخرین
شب ما برای شام بیرون رفتیم و فکر کردم "بهتر است مدتی دراز بکشم ، در غیر این صورت من نیستم
من می توانم آن را بسازم ، من نمی توانم به آنچه اتفاق می افتد توجه کنم ، من هستم
نمی توان آن را انجام داد. " و من نمی توانستم ببینم که با چه چیزی نمی توانم باشم ، و از این رو مورد اصابت قرار گرفت
من آنچه من نمی توانم با آن باشم این است - زیرا من فکر می کردم: "راکت من چیست؟" من فکر کردم که
راکت من این بود که من نمی توانستم با چقدر مردم مرا دوست داشته باشند زیرا می ترسیدم
مردم مرا دوست نداشتند ، و من دیدم که این اصلاً راکت من نبود. راکت من این است که من هیچ
ظرفیت این است که با چقدر مردم را دوست دارم و آن را بیان می کنم. من آن را مانند یک مفهوم گفته ام ، و من
برای بیان عشق من به جای "بودن" عشق من به مردم ، باید کارها را انجام دهم. و من هنوز احساس بیماری می کنم و زندگی باورنکردنی دارم و به سختی می توانم با آن باشم. کله
خوب ، این باعث اشتباه شما می شود. مارگارت
بله ، کاملاً شگفت انگیز است من هر روز صبح از خواب بیدار می شوم و فکر می کنم ، "این زندگی من نیست ، این است
زندگی شخص دیگری کسی قصد دارد درباره من پیروز شود و آنها می خواهند فرش را بکشند ،
و این دیگر در آنجا نخواهد بود ، و همه چیز لعنتی خواهد شد. "
کله
خوب ، در حال حاضر است. (خنده)
ببینید ، اگر مکالمه ای را که دیشب شروع کردیم به یاد می آورید ، پاکسازی که قرار است یک باشد
انسان که شما در آن زندگی می کنید: "مشکلی پیش آمده است."
مارگارت
وجود دارد کاملا کله
بله و این مفهومی نیست شما "مشکلی وجود دارد". شما همچنین این را ساخته اید
چیزی نه تنها چیزی اشتباه است ، بلکه به معنای چیزی است که مشکلی وجود دارد. مارگارت
نباید اینگونه باشد. کله
چه چیز دیگری؟ "رسوایی فلسفه" این نیست که
هنوز اثبات داده نشده است ، اما چنین اثبات هایی
انتظار می رود و دوباره و دوباره تلاش می شوند. [ بشر .] اگر Dasein به درستی درک شود ، مخالف است
چنین اثبات هایی ، زیرا در وجود آن ، در حال حاضر
همان چیزی است که اثبات های بعدی لازم است که لازم باشد
برای آن نشان دهید. (BT 249
حرف
)
"
یعنی همیشه دنیا از موقعیت از قبل جهان را می شناسد
بودن در آنجا وقتی داسین خود را به سمت چیزی هدایت می کند
و آن را درک می کند ، ابتدا به نوعی دریافت نمی کند
خارج از یک حوزه درونی که در آن بوده است
به صورت تقریبی محصور شده است ، اما اصلی آن است
نوع وجود به گونه ای است که همیشه "خارج" است
در کنار موجوداتی که با آن روبرو می شود و
حرف
که متعلق به دنیایی است که قبلاً کشف شده است. (BT 89 ، تأکید افزود
حرف
)
"
از طرف دیگر ، مطمئناً این حس وجود دارد که ما در آن هستیم
داخل:
[e] ven در این "خارج از کشور" در کنار
اگر ما ، Dasein هنوز "درون" است.
این را به معنای صحیح درک کنید. این است
برای گفتن ، این خود "درون" به عنوان یک موجود است-
دنیایی که می داند. و علاوه بر این ،
درک آنچه شناخته شده است فرایندی نیست
بازگشت با غنیمت شخص به "کابینت"
از آگاهی از آگاهی خارج شده است و
آن را درک کرد حتی در درک ، حفظ و
حفظ ، داسین که می داند باقی مانده است
در خارج ، و این کار را به عنوان dasein انجام می دهد. (BT 89
حرف
)

بنابراین معضل داخل/خارج یک مشکل نادرست است. انسان
دنیای آنها را از طریق موجود در آن و مقابله با آن بدانید. 314

مارگارت
خوب می توانم ببینم که این به معنای چیزی نیست و بعد امروز صبح از خواب بیدار شدم و فکر کردم ،
خوب پس من نباید ناراحت باشم که احساس خوبی ندارم ، یا گلویم درد می کند ، یا اینکه سرم
صدمه دیده کله
اکنون این خیلی خوب است. این معنی دادن به معنی ندارد. ببینید "اگر به معنای این نیست-
چیز ، بنابراین ، به منظور ... "
مارگارت
یا اگر واقعاً آن را دریافت کردم ، بیمار نخواهم شد. کله
درست مارگارت
من حتی نمی دانم بیمار هستم. حقیقت این است ، من حتی نمی دانم. کله
درست خوب ، مطمئناً شما راه دیگری از آنچه هستید خواهید بود. مارگارت
من به نوعی مانند پشت گوشه ای هستم. من نمی توانم در مورد آن صحبت کنم ، بنابراین اکنون باید یک روش متفاوت احساس کنم
از نظر جسمی احساس می کنم. که دیوانه است کله
نه دیوانه نیست ، آن را عادی می نامند. این طبیعی است مارگارت
من آن را دریافت کردم کله
این همان چیزی است که همه در هر روز در آن قدم می زنند. مارگارت
و من همچنین می بینم: من تمام زندگی خود را طراحی کرده ام تا از هر کسی محافظت شود که از این طریق است
درباره من من نتایج عالی و باورنکردنی را به دست می آورم. من در اطرافم چیزهای خوبی ایجاد خواهم کرد تا مردم
از بین نمی رود. بسیار لعنتی است! مردم در مورد من نمی دانند که تمام آنچه که من از آن استفاده می کنم
که مردم مرا دوست ندارند. کله
می دانید ، من فکر می کنم که فکر می کنیم پیچیده است. ما هر روز با این نشانه ها قدم می زنیم
گفتن به همه دقیقاً همانطور که با ماست. دور زدن
هایدگر همچنین خاطرنشان می کند که این درک پیشین
از جهان کیفیت خاصی دارد. چیزهایی که ما با آنها
خودمان را در دنیای روزمره خود نگران کنیم ، چیزهایی است که ما
استفاده در تجارت زندگی. با این روش روبرو شده اند ، آنها
مطالب دانستن پدیدارشناختی - دانستن که رشد می کند
سعادت
از بودن (BT 95). این دانستن ممکن است صریح باشد یا نباشد
حرف
آگاهی ما:
چگونه موجوداتی که با آنها زندگی می کنیم نشان می دهند
خودشان در درجه اول و بیشتر از همه
قسمت؟ در اینجا در سالن اجتماعاتی که انجام می دهیم نشسته ایم
در واقع دیوارها را دستگیر نکنید - مگر اینکه ما
خسته می شوند با این وجود ، دیوارها
قبل از اینکه فکر کنیم آنها به عنوان فکر می کنیم
اشیاء (BPP 163
پ
)
"
قبل از اینکه آنها برای ما اشیاء باشند ، دیوارها به عنوان بخشی از آن وجود دارند
زمینه تجهیزات. با دانستن که ناشی از بودن است ، من هستم
بلافاصله در نقش من به چیزهای دنیای من ارائه نمی شود
متقاضی ، کسی که به دنبال درک و توصیف آنها است. در عوض با آنها روبرو می شوم و از آنها در تجارت زندگی استفاده می کنم:
نزدیکترین چیزهایی که ما را احاطه می کنیم
تجهیزات همیشه در حال حاضر یک منیفولد وجود دارد
تجهیزات: تجهیزات کار ، برای
مسافرت ، برای اندازه گیری و به طور کلی موارد
که باید با آنها انجام دهیم. (BPP 163

روز چهارم: جلسه یک

مارگارت
این واضح ، درست است؟ کله
این برای همه آشکار است ، اینطور نیست ، مگر اینکه شما مانند آن قدم می زنید که آشکار نیست. مارگارت
خوب ، برای من هرگز چنین زندگی نکرده است. همیشه این بوده است که من باید اطمینان حاصل کنم که این بسیار بی وقفه است ،
برای پوشاندن همه درزهای کوچک ، بنابراین مردم از این امر خارج نمی شوند. کله
آیا از این کار خارج نمی شوید؟ مارگارت
که می ترسیدم مردم مرا دوست نداشته باشند ، و کسی که بیشتر از آن مخفی می کردم من است ، یا
که من مردم را دوست دارم. به نظر می رسد چنین حرفی احمقانه است. که من مثل اینکه یک
دستگاه من مثل یک ماشین بوده ام. کله
منظورت از آن چیست؟ مارگارت
خوب ، مانند ... ساده ترین راهی که می توانم بگویم این است که من حق نداشتم. من همیشه سعی می کردم برخی را بدست آورم
کجا یا کاری انجام می دهد. کله
بله ، اما آنچه من می گویم این است که کمی مفهومی است ... من هنوز نمی شنوم که شما به اشتراک می گذارید. مارگارت (بعد از مکث طولانی)
خوب من به مادرم زنگ زدم. من از مادرم بسیار ناراحت بودم ، زیرا من فقط یک ماه ازدواج کردم
پیش او نمی خواست به عروسی من بیاید. کله
نه نه او نمی خواست به عروسی بیاید یا او به عروسی نیامده است. مارگارت
او به عروسی نیامد. اما من این را داشتم که او نمی خواست به عروسی من و آن بیاید
به معنای همه این چیزها بود. کله
منظور این بود؟ چگونه می توانم این چیزها را درک کنم؟ منظره ای که در آن زمینه تجهیزات
در ابتدا ، کاملاً غیرقابل دفاع است
و بی فکر ، منظره و دید است
دوربرد عملی ، از عملی ما
جهت گیری روزمره "بی فکر" یعنی
که از نظر موضوعی دستگیر نشده است
تفکر عمدی در مورد چیزها ؛ در عوض ،
در دور زدن ما یاتاقان های خود را در
با توجه به آنها دوربرد دور زدن و
چیزها را در درجه اول به عنوان تجهیزات درک می کند. [ بشر .] ما می گوییم که یک زمینه تجهیزات
محاصره ما (BPP 163 ، تأکید افزود
پ
)
"
مطمئناً می توانم نقش جدا شده ای در رابطه با جهان داشته باشم ،
درک به عنوان یک علم یا یک کار فکری بودن
انجام شده اما این همیشه در برابر پس زمینه اتفاق می افتد
از دنیایی که من از بودن در آن می دانم. پس زمینه
درک اول است. جهان چیزی متعاقب آن نیست
ما در نتیجه از جمع همه محاسبه می کنیم
موجودات جهان نمی آید نه erward بلکه
پیش از این ، به معنای دقیق کلمه. [ بشر .] جهان همانطور که قبلاً رونمایی شده است
به گونه ای است که ما در واقع به طور خاص انجام نمی دهیم
خودمان را با آن اشغال کنیم ، یا آن را دستگیر کنیم ، اما
درعوض آن بسیار مشهود است ، خیلی موضوع
البته ، که ما کاملاً فراموشی هستیم
آن (BPP 165
پ
)
"
این در استعاره ای است که اغلب توسط ورنر ارهارد مانند آب به کار می رود
یک ماهی: اساسی برای وجود ، اما در عین حال در دسترس ما در دسترس نیست. ما موجودات موجود در آن نظر را می بینیم - آنها به صورت موجود اتفاق می افتد ، که
زیرا هایدگر به این معنی است که آنها به عنوان اتفاقات اساسی در
جهان 316
وجود
مارگارت
او مرا دوست نداشت. "چه مشکلی با من وجود دارد که او نمی خواست به عروسی من بیاید؟ چگونه
ممکن است این باشد؟ " و می دانید که این خنده دار بود زیرا وقتی او اولین بار به من گفت - که او نبود
با آمدن به عروسی من - این Fi Ne بود. در اولین بار من آن را گرفتم ، و بعد از آن به معنای چیزی بودم. کله
بنابراین این بدان معنی است که مادر شما به عروسی شما نمی آید ... مارگارت
او به عروسی من نمی آمد. کله
"مادرم به عروسی من نمی آید."
مارگارت
و بعد من معنی آن چیزی بود. کله
منظور شما این بود؟ مارگارت
اول این بدان معنی بود که مشکلی در من وجود داشت که او به عروسی من نمی آمد. اگر من راهی که من نبودم ، او به عروسی من می آمد. مشکلی وجود داشت
من و پس از آن من به این معنی بود که او مرا دوست نداشت. کله
این بدان معناست که مشکلی با او وجود دارد. مارگارت
درست کله
همه می دانند که این مرحله بعدی است که شما مشکلی در شما وجود دارد؟ برخی وجود دارد-
مشکلی با آنها وجود دارد. مارگارت
و بعد ام ، می دانید ، من در طی دو ماه قبل از ازدواج و من به او زنگ زدم
با او صحبت می کردم ، و من می توانم ببینم که وقتی شروع کردم به این که او به من نمی آید
عروسی به معنای چیزی است ، تمام کاری که من می توانستم انجام دهم این بود که با او به عنوان یک مرتبه صحبت کنم: برای به دست آوردن او
برای آمدن به عروسی من برای اینکه او را دوست داشته باشد. من حتی از آنجا رفتم ، "اگر او نمی خواهد
بیا به عروسی من ، کمترین کاری که او می توانست انجام دهد این بود که به من بگو که او مرا دوست دارد. " و فقط ... این بود
خنده دار ، زیرا من فقط دو روز پیش در هنگام استراحت به او زنگ زدم و به او گفتم: "من فقط تماس گرفتم
اما جهان خود نظم متفاوتی دارد. در
خود جهان همانطور که داسین اتفاق می افتد رخ می دهد. و دا-Sein ، به یاد داشته باشید ،
هم در اینجاست و هم ، زیرا هایدگر پاک کننده است. در
پدیده مانند چیزی نیست که ما به فکر کردن عادت کنیم. بدین ترتیب
ارائه هایدگر از اوضاع تحریک آمیز است:
جهان جمع کل نیست
نهادها این کاملاً به طور کلی وجود ندارد. این تعیین [b] eing in-the-world ، a
لحظه ای در ساختار حالت Dasein
از وجود جهان چیزی است که dasein-ish است ،
مانند چیزها وجود ندارد اما DA است ، آنجا ،
مانند Dasein ، موجودات [das da-sein]
که ما خودمان هستیم: یعنی وجود دارد. (BPP 166
پ
)
"
بنابراین ، جهان ممکن است به عنوان یک پاکسازی در جایی که ممکن است اتفاق بیفتد دیده شود
معنادار این همچنین یک تعریف کار از انسان است:
پاکسازی در جهان برای معنا. هر دو تعریف ما را راهنمایی می کنند
به یک تمایز ، تمایزی که به قلمرو ناگفته اشاره دارد
جهان درک جهانی به عنوان درک دان
خود درک است خود و جهان متعلق است
با هم در موجودیت واحد ، Dasein. خود
و جهان دو موجود نیست ، مانند موضوع و
شیء ، یا مثل من و تو ، اما خود و جهان
تعیین اساسی خود داسین است
در وحدت ساختار [b] eing-in-the-
جهان (BPP 297
پ
)
"
قدرت تحول آمیز این مجمع ناشی از تحریک آن است
از آن وحدت ■
روز چهارم: جلسه یک
317
تا به شما اطلاع دهم ... من فقط تماس گرفتم تا سلام کنم. " ما فقط به نوعی صحبت کردیم.
با او ادامه داشت من به او گفتم که عروسی ما عالی است و من عکسهای خوبی گرفتم
از عکاس ، که من نمی توانستم صبر کنم تا آنها را به او نشان دهم ، که من واقعاً او را دوست دارم. او گفت
برای من ، خوب ، من به او گفتم که من نمی دانم چگونه یک رابطه ایجاد کنم یا چگونه یک نوع داشته باشم
از رابطه ای که برای شما مفید است. من سعی می کنم کاری انجام دهم و هیچ کاری انجام نداده ام-
چیزی که واقعاً کار کرده است "تمام کاری که من انجام داده ام این است که از آنچه در شما اشتباه بوده است یا چه چیزی بوده است
با من اشتباه کرد و سعی کنید این را به شما بگویم ، و باعث شود کاری متفاوت انجام دهید. " و او گفت
برای من ، "فقط خودت باش." می دانید ، واقعاً قابل توجه بود. چون هرچه می رود
از طریق او می گذرد. و پدرم فقط درگذشت و او به من گفت ، شما می دانید ، او فقط
کمی در مورد آن با من به اشتراک گذاشت ... کیپ
گفت؟ مارگارت
او گفت: "این کار سختی است و من نمی دانم که چگونه می توانم از پس آن برآیم و چه کاری انجام می دهم."
و من هم دیدم ... مادرم و برادرانم به من گفته اند: "شما در آن زندگی نمی کنید
همان شهری که انجام می دهیم ، شما نمی توانید همان رابطه ای را که با یکدیگر داریم داشته باشید. " وت
من دیدم که او ناراحت است که من زندگی نمی کنم که در آن زندگی می کند. من قبلاً چنین چیزی را نشنیده ام. اینقدر
ما فقط مکالمه ای داشتیم که دیگر نیش وجود نداشت. دیگر من سعی نکردم
تا او را به انجام کاری برساند. این مکالمه ای بود که ما در واقع با یکدیگر صحبت می کردیم
به جای اینکه سعی کنم او را به انجام کاری برسانم. و این یک آغاز است و من هم به او گفتم
تنها چیزی که من به آن متعهد شدم این بود که او واقعاً ، می دانید ، زندگی خود را برای او انجام داده است. و من هیچی نداشتم
تصور کنید که این چه خواهد بود و او هم چنین نکرد. این واقعاً یک آغاز بود ، مکانی برای صحبت کردن
به یکدیگر از و دیدم که سعی نکرده ام او را به انجام کاری برسانم. بنابراین با این حال من آویزان شدم
من از طریق تلفن ، من رضایت داشتم ، و به هر حال من کار کردم هرگز مرا راضی نکرد
صحبت با او کله
چیز دیگری؟ مارگارت
یکی از مواردی که من برای دریافتم به انجمن آمدم راهی برای همکاری با افرادی است که با آنها کار می کنم
که من مانند یک انسان خاص منحصر به فرد زندگی نمی کنم ، اما واقعاً قادر به کمک به هر چیز دیگری هستم
تمایز برای من برای آنها واضح است تا آنها بتوانند هر کاری را که می توانم انجام دهم انجام دهند. و من
می توانم ببینم ، من چه کسی دارم ... من نمی دانم چگونه این کار را انجام دهم و در واقع مانند یک امکان برای من زندگی می کنم ،
در رابطه من با افرادی که با آنها کار می کنم ، به جای کاری که قرار است انجام دهم ،
برای ساختن آن باید باشم. و چگونه من ... وقتی نمی توانستم با برخی باشم
کاری که من نمی دانستم چگونه انجام دهم ، یا در مقابل عدم دانستن نحوه تحویل ، ایستادن
در تمام کارهایی که ما انجام داده ایم ، نمی دانیم چگونه این کار را انجام دهیم. کاری که من انجام می دهم این است که من به جای آن از نیرو استفاده می کنم
توانایی داشتن با هر اتفاقی که می افتد.
