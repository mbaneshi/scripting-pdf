It’ll delay confronting the anger.
ERHARD
It might do that but that’s not my point. My point is that being well related with somebody 
ought to be a source of fulfi llment and satisfaction, yes? 
MIKE
That’s a presupposition.
ERHARD
Yeah: A fairly safe one. If you and I are well related, there ought to be a sense of being fulfi lled 
by that.
MIKE
Okay.
ERHARD
But if you and I are well related in order to avoid being angry, the result of being well related
is not satisfaction and fulfi llment: it is avoiding being angry. So you can be well related all over
the place and it’s not going to leave you full of joy or profoundly satisfi ed. It’s going to leave you
having avoided anger. You won and they gave you the booby prize. Is that clearer?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
There are accomplished people who are not nurtured by their accomplishments, because they 
are accomplished in order to not be something they’re avoiding being.
(to Mike)

MIKE
Partially.
ERHARD

MIKE
Okay.

 But if you and I are well related in order to 
avoid being angry, the result of being well 
related is not satisfaction and fulfillment: it is 
avoiding being angry.
