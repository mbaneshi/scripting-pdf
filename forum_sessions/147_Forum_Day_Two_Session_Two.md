ANGEL
Having this as a racket isn’t my fault?
ERHARD
No, the question of fault is... it isn’t somebody else’s fault either. And it’s your responsibility.
And as I’ve said, nobody knows what I’m talking about when I use the word responsibility, so
we’re not going to talk about that much anymore. Relax until we get back. You’ve been living
with the pain for however many years it’s been, another... while people take a break... You know,
peeing is very important to people... Peeing is more important to people than their lives. And
particularly more important than your life. If it was their life they might not have to pee, but
because it’s your life, they have to pee. So we’ll continue this after the break.
Erhard left the room, and Kipp came onto the platform. He moved to the blackboard and expanded
what Erhard had written about the structure of a racket:
right
g
dominates
justifi es itself
j
win
wrong   avoids domination        invalidates others      lose
KIPP
The payoff  expresses itself as: it always dominates, wins, or justifi es itself. Till you can get up
here on the board, I promise you nothing. The structure for the payoff , what keeps the payoff  in
place, is what’s up there on the board. The fi rst thing it costs you is your self-expression. Second,
the cost is any happiness in your life. You’re only happy to be right. The next cost is your vitality
or your health. And the fi nal cost of having your life be lived by your racket is the possibility of
love, of affi  nity.  You cannot put love, affi  nity, and being right together. If the cost gets bigger
than the payoff , you’ll give it up in a moment. That’s why in a tragedy you’ll be heroic: because
the cost is right there in your face. Angel has been too generous. She has given you the whole
mechanism. If she couldn’t be right about the pain what would she have to confront in her life?
Erhard joined Kipp on the platform.
ERHARD
Angel, the pain makes the divorces right. You getting a divorce was wrong, and the pain makes
it right. You’ve got the pain to make yourself right. That’s the payoff . What I’m asking you to see
is that the pain is not there because you got divorced. The pain is there to keep you from being
wrong about having been divorced. It works that way, doesn’t it?
ANGEL
Yes.
ERHARD
Never mind why it’s there. Forget that for the moment. Too hard to see that. If the pain weren’t
there you’d be very wrong wouldn’t you? You’d be a shallow nobody whose promises didn’t
ontic structures to correct the problem—empathy and “welfare
work” are two that Heidegger mentions. But he also points out that
these ontic solutions can never constitute or adequately replace
Being-with, since they overlook the fundamental ontological issue:
the deficiencies in the dominant modes of Being-with.
But solicitude has a positive mode as well, which Heidegger
calls extreme solicitude. This mode has two forms. On the one
hand, Dasein can leap in for the Other:
This kind of solicitude takes over for the Other
that with which he is to concern himself. The
Other is thus thrown out of his own position. .
. . In such solicitude the Other can become one
who is dominated and dependent, even if this
domination is a tacit one and remains hidden
from him. This kind of solicitude, which leaps
in and takes away ‘care,’ is to a large extent
determinative for Being with one another. . . .
(BT 158)
“
In normal circumstances, a Forum participant might expect to
receive that kind of sympathetic response to her circumstances,
such as the marital issues being described by this participant. But
Erhard’s solicitude in The Forum is of the second form:
[This is] a kind of solicitude which does not
so much leap in for the Other as leap ahead of
him . . . not in order to take away his ‘care’ but
rather to give it back to him authentically as
such for the first time. This kind of solicitude
pertains essentially to authentic care—that is,
to the existence of the Other, not to a “what”
with which he is concerned; it helps the Other
to become transparent to himself in his care
and to become free for it. (BT 158–159)
“
We find in Heidegger’s distinction here of extreme solicitude as
leaping ahead of the Other a profound characterization of the role
r
of a Forum leader. ■

SPEAKING BEING
mean anything, wouldn’t you? Yeah. So you need the pain to keep you from being wrong. At
least it works that way doesn’t it?
(She nods)
Good, that’s all I want you to see for the moment. I want you to see how godawful important
it is to look good. Now we’ve gotten looking good a lot more sharply defi ned. Looking good is
constituted by being right. Or having something you identify with as right. And having other
people and other things be wrong. Angel would tell you that people who get divorced easily and
don’t have any pain are wrong. I want you to see that it is so important that you’re willing to
suff er pain over a long period of time: intense pain over a long period of time that destroys your
happiness. Being right is so important, so sacred, that even a lot of pain over a long time is not
too much a price to pay to be right. I want you to see that this is not anything that would occur
to you normally. It would never ever in a million years occur to Angel that the pain made her
right, because that’s not the structure for interpretation in which we hold life. You and I have
invented a new structure of interpretation for life: racket. Getting divorced does not produce
pain. Having your child die does not produce pain. Rackets produce pain. What happens never
produces pain. If you lose a child and you’re sad, that heals the loss, and that’s not a racket.
Authentic sadness heals the loss, then the loss diminishes, then the sadness, and fi nally it’s
complete. But not in a racket: where life becomes about being sad. It’s very hard to see this, and
that’s why you need to distinguish this possibility powerfully so that what was a soap opera, a
drama, which is very real and valid, can be seen for what it is, namely a racket. That isn’t going
to be easy for you to do, so you need to listen up with the distinguishing.
(indicating Angel)
You and I are not fi nished. After the break.
Kipp set up paired shares. The Forum Supervisor announced the beginning of the break at 3:50 pm.

SPEAKING BEING
SESSION TWO INTERVAL
The Forgetting of Being, Part One of Eight: Getting and Losing
In November 2013, while this book was in development, we delivered a presenta-
tion about it as members of a panel at the National Communication Association
conference in Washington DC. Our thesis was that the ontological discourse of The
Forum provides participants with direct access to an experience of Being. Following
the presentation, an audience member asked this question: Aft er participants have
undergone the experience of Being that The Forum makes available, what becomes
of that experience? Does it persist?
This is obviously a central question for any consideration of Erhard’s work.
From its inception as the est Training, there has been a persistent quality of elusive-
t
ness, and therefore of mystery,
y about the transformation this work makes available.
People do not leave The Forum having gained the kind of cognitive understanding
we generally expect from an educational process. The result, instead, is that by en-
gaging in the conversation that occurs in The Forum, participants have “gotten it,” in
somewhat the way that one gets a joke. Heidegger characterizes such a phenome-
non as undergoing an experience with language, which means that language “befalls
us, strikes us, comes over us, overwhelms us and transforms us” (“NL” in OWL 57).
The process is not linear; Erhard has described it as not getting it for a long
time, and then getting it all at once. But there is at the same time a recognition that
what you’re suddenly seeing is a truth you’d already always known at some level.
Heidegger characterized it as “a leap” onto the ground on which we are already
standing (WCT 233), and Erhard has characterized it in similar terms: “I can’t have it
T
and give it to you. But I can communicate in a way so that you get an opportunity to
realize that you have it yourself already. Essentially, this is what the est Training [and
t
later The Forum] was developed to do” (Bartley 169).
y
Heidegger’s German word for this kind of experience is Augenblick. The usual
translation is instant, moment, or split second; but Hubert Dreyfus says that in Heide-
gger’s use, the word is more appropriately rendered as moment of vision or transfor-
mation (BT, note 376; Dreyfus,
T
Being-in-the-World 321). In
d
Being and Time, Heidegger
uses the word to designate the gestalt switch that occurs when a human being takes
resolute ownership of his life and an authentic existence becomes possible (BT 387).
T
Since the experience of The Forum is not understood in the usual way, neither
is it retained in memory in the way that cognitive understanding is. Being can be
communicated, and the results reported by Forum participants give evidence that
its communication is experienced as transformative; but a quality of elusiveness
persists in the way that transformative experience is retained. Further, according to
Erhard, the elusiveness is to be expected. “That’s the way it’s supposed to happen,”
he tells The Forum participants. “Getting and losing.”
Why the elusiveness? What is it about Being that leads it to withdraw—as it
has withdrawn over two millennia from the human experience of existence; and as
it withdraws repeatedly during The Forum dialogue as Erhard and the participants
struggle to bring it to presence?
Heidegger has provided a response to this question in a series of lectures he
delivered at the University of Freiburg in 1935. Published in 1959 under the title An
