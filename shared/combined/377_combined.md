Forum Day Four: Session One

SALLY
I got what you were saying up until you were talking about talking.
ERHARD
Good and bad is talking. When you talk about good and bad you’re talking about talking.
SALLY
Okay, I got it.
ERHARD
Did you sort it out?
SALLY
Yeah, there’s just one more thing I want to ask.
ERHARD
Sure.
SALLY
So this morning, we got into a fi ght, my whole family...
ERHARD
Right. Families do that, don’t they?
SALLY
Yeah, all the time.
ERHARD
No: They do it when they do it and they don’t do it when they don’t do it.
SALLY
Right.
ERHARD
“All the time” is a story.
SALLY
Right. So we got in a fi ght this morning, and so I said “It doesn’t mean anything, so leave me
the fuck alone.”
ERHARD
Right. How many people have done that already: “It doesn’t mean anything, therefore...”
the transformation of human being arise in that very surrender of
human control to the unpredictable play of Being, the surrender
to the mutuality of the event of appropriation? The following
passage, in which Heidegger is thinking through a Parmenidean
fragment, suggests the essential and continual uncertainty
constitutive of the three-fold path he posits, “that of Being, that
of not-Being, and that of seeming”:
Superior knowing [. . .] is granted only to one
r
who has experienced the sweeping storm on
the way of Being, to whom the terror of the
second way to the abyss of Nothing has not
remained foreign, and who has still taken
over the third way, the way of seeming, as a
constant and urgent need. To this knowing
belongs what the Greeks in their great age
called tolma: to dare everything with Being,
not-Being, and seeming all at once—that is,
to raise Dasein above itself into the de-cision
about Being, not-Being, and seeming.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (continuing; participants raising hands)
You’re scum, I know that.
(laughter)
We told you not to do that and you did it right away, and if you haven’t yet, you will. Sleazy.
SALLY
I’ve also found myself wanting to do the same thing with them. It’s only bad if you make it
mean something bad.
ERHARD
No, it’s bad because it’s bad. But you have to understand whence bad arises, or bad disempow-
ers you. You can’t avoid bad. Bad’s there. Like I said, go out and do something illegal, and you’ll
fi nd out about what bad is.
SALLY
So what if I don’t think something’s bad but my dad does?
ERHARD
Who pays the food bills in your house?
SALLY  (laughing)
He does. So it doesn’t matter if I think something’s bad or not.
ERHARD
Sure it matters if you think it’s bad. But look, what you’ve got is not the same kind of authority
that your father has because you don’t pay the bills. So if you’re going to deal with the way you
see things and the way he sees things, you’re going to have to deal with it in a diff erent method
than he does. He deals with it like he pays the bills. You can’t deal with it like that, because you
don’t pay the bills. You’ve got to fi nd another way to deal with it. Did you hear what I said?
SALLY
I think so. What I do costs him money, so...
ERHARD
No, what I mean is, he’s got authority. You don’t have authority. You’re not the boss in his
house, he is, right?
SALLY
Yeah.
Forum Day Four: Session One
365
ERHARD
And that’s the way that is. And you know you can bitch and moan and complain, and all the
stuff  about that, or you can get that that is where the door is. A lot of people want to go out
there, and they go over and start kicking on the wall. Because they want to go out there! Fine,
the door is over there. You want to have your way, what you got to get is where the door is. And
where the door is, is that your father’s the boss. That’s how to get what you want is “my father’s
the boss.” If you try to get what you want through “my father’s the boss,” you go through the
door, instead of kicking your way through the wall. You have a much better chance getting
to what’s on the other side of the wall going through the door than kicking your way through
the wall. Yeah, you’ll get through the wall every once in a while, but you’ll also be left bloody.
Yeah, and the other thing is that it isn’t fair. Gravity isn’t fair. Shouldn’t old people get a break
from gravity? That’s what you sound like with that “life isn’t fair” shit. Okay fi ne. That’s where
the door is: The door is, “life isn’t fair.” You want to get where you’re going, you’ve got to go
through the door. Continuing to kick the wall is saying “life isn’t fair.” What is this conversa-
tion “Life isn’t fair”? What is it? What is the point? It’s another goddamned drama. Life isn’t
fair. Your father’s the boss, and you live with another adult. You ought to be equal. Too bad.
That’s not the way it turned out. Your father’s the boss, and you can get what you want—not
that you can always get what you want—but you got some power to get what you want, as long
as you go through the door. If you don’t go through the door you’re going to have to use force.
You’re going to have to make your father wrong, or run away, or fuck something up...
Even if I’m going through the door, but I’m being covert about it then I’m kicking down the
wall.
ERHARD
Exactly. And I didn’t say you shouldn’t use your wiles. Nothing wrong with buttering up the old
man.
(laughter)
You don’t want to defi ne everything. “Okay, now we’re going to do foreplay, are you ready?”
It’s not a good approach. So yeah, covert is one thing, and playing the game is another thing.
You’re allowed to play the game and that will work.
SALLY
Being covert won’t work?
ERHARD
No. Being covert doesn’t work. That’s like trying to put one over on somebody. But playing with
people works. Particularly with fathers with their daughters. Fathers are easy with their daugh-
ters, except when the daughter tries to kick through the wall, right? Okay, you can sit down.

SPEAKING BEING
GLORIA
I keep trying to bring morality into this.
ERHARD
The drama of morality...
GLORIA
Like what she said: If life is empty and meaningless, why produce?
ERHARD
Why produce if life is empty and meaningless?
GLORIA
Not if...
ERHARD
Given that life is empty and meaningless, why produce? There is no reason to produce. Except
for one thing, Gloria: You did not hear that life was empty and meaningless. You’ve been in
a conversation with other people and not with me. See, “life is empty and meaningless” does
not tell you what to do with your life. It gives you no guidance at all, none. My “empty and
meaningless” is worthless. Your “empty and meaningless” gives you guidance. So your “empty
and meaningless” tells you that going on is worthless. My “empty and meaningless” tells me
nothing, gives no prescriptions, explains nothing, justifi es nothing. That’s the “empty and
meaningless” we’re talking about here. The “empty and meaningless” you’re talking about is
not the one I’m talking about. Out of your “empty and meaningless” you get a meaning about
what you should do, you get a prescription for what you should do for your life. My “empty and
meaningless” has no prescriptions in it. You went to the seminar on the other side of the wall.
Over there they got a seminar about empty and meaningless and it tells you what to do with
your life.
GLORIA
I can understand it intellectually.
ERHARD
What does that mean “intellectually”? I don’t understand “intellectually.”
GLORIA
I understand it makes sense.
Forum Day Four: Session One
367
ERHARD
You understand it with the understanding you have, I get that. You understand it. Period. Now
what is it that’s missing?
GLORIA
It makes me feel like shit.
ERHARD
Yeah, you don’t like it. The man did not say you would like the truth. As a matter of fact, the
fi rst thing the truth will do is piss you off . Didn’t you notice people in here?
GLORIA (laughing)
I almost got into a fi ght last night because of that.
ERHARD
Because of the truth?
GLORIA
Because of it was empty and meaningless. She was a Forum staff  person so it made me really
want to punch her.
ERHARD
This is turning the truth into shit. How could empty and meaningless generate anything?
GLORIA (referring to Sally)
What she said about “fuck it.”
ERHARD
But that’s not the empty and meaningless that you got in here. That’s the empty and meaning-
less you got in the seminar on the other side of the wall. The one you paid $625 for, you didn’t
get that one. You got the cheap one, you got the one that doesn’t cost anything. The $625 one
does not give you any prescriptions, it does not justify anything. See, you want to use it to justi-
fy something. Right?
GLORIA
Yeah.
ERHARD
You think it justifi es doing nothing, but that’s not the empty and meaningless we’re talking
about in here. The empty and meaningless we’re talking about in here justifi es nothing. And
what bothers you is it’s going to invalidate your whole life because you’re a “rice Christian.”
You didn’t work to work.
368
SPEAKING BEING
GLORIA
I don’t go to church.
ERHARD
Yeah, you’re a “rice Christian.” I don’t care whether you go to church or not, you’re a “rice
Christian.” You don’t work to work. You work in-order-to. That makes you a slave.
GLORIA
That’s human. We’re all human.
ERHARD
Horseshit, human. It’s crap. See, you just used the truth to justify something. You took all of the
truth out of it. Yes, it is quite human and it justifi es nothing, it explains nothing, and if it does
justify or explain something it is no longer the truth. It’s just some stupid justifi cation.
GLORIA
I can’t get any possibility out of it.
ERHARD
No, because you haven’t gotten it yet.
GLORIA
Okay.
ERHARD
You’ve got to go through that feeling bad, Gloria. You get to feeling bad and stop. You’ve got to
go all the way through the feeling bad. Did you get that? You’ve got to go all the way through
it. You still have got something there. You haven’t gotten to empty and meaningless yet. You’ve
gotten to “empty and meaningless and that’s bad.” That’s not all the way through it. Clear?
GLORIA
Yeah.
ERHARD
Good for you.
(applause)
Jake?
On the fi rst day of The Forum, Jake, an architect, was the participant who was “hustle waiting to
happen,” and who also had his “foot nailed to the fl oor” in regard to sincerity and inauthenticity.
Forum Day Four: Session One
369
JAKE
I was going to ask about the truth, but you already answered that question. But I wanted to also
share a little about my racket. I wanted to thank you. It sounds like you knew a little bit more
about me than I expected. I appreciate that.
ERHARD
I know about being human.
JAKE
It sounds to me that you know what my profession is. I have an attractive profession. It makes
me more attractive.
ERHARD
I have a profound respect for your profession. And I probably have more respect for it than
most of the people who do it. I see it as a very, very, very important opening for humanity. And
I know there are also people in your profession who also see your profession in that way, but
not a lot of them. There’s something very important in there that humanity has yet to explore. I
have a deep respect for design. A deep respect. And it’s a mystery I don’t get. But your partic-
ular profession would not be a bad place to explore the mystery of design. But exploring the
mystery of design is diff erent than just doing design.
JAKE
And that’s what I would want to do, but having it as a racket just fucks it all up. And I chose
the profession because it was an attractive profession. I chose it because I needed a job. I come
from a highly educated family, and there’s one time I thought I was going to be a bum.
ERHARD
And you decided against that.
JAKE
Yeah, I decided against that, so I went to school. I got a career: a degree and a license. And
I was lucky enough to pick a profession, which I now fi nd exciting, but it’s really fucked the
way—it could be a lot more exciting if I get this other shit out of the way.
ERHARD
Exactly. That’s very good. Jake and I have had enough interactions for something useful to
happen here. See I know it sounds in the beginning in particular—and for some of you it still
sounds like—that everything I say is an insult, everything I say is a put-down. I know that
some of you will describe this to people as “they called me bad names”; ”they beat me up”;
“They wouldn’t let me use the bathroom”; “He said ‘fuck’ and went like this.”
370
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (to laughter, making a gesture with his hands indicating the sex act)
I actually acknowledged that when Jake and I fi rst began to speak, that there’s a lot of accom-
plishment in this room. I didn’t call you an asshole because I didn’t know you were accom-
plished. I knew you were accomplished and I called you an asshole. Like Jake said: There’s a lot
of satisfaction in what he does and there’s the possibility of a lot more satisfaction in what he
does. That is what the asshole was about. It was not meant to denigrate you. It was said in full
knowledge of your accomplishment. It was way more insulting than you thought, but it was
not meant to denigrate. It was said in full knowledge that you’re accomplished and there’s a lot
more there could be.
JAKE
This has been a great experience. I stole a lot of the microphone—talking is another racket. I’ve
got every racket in this room. And I think everybody else in this room have all the rackets...
ERHARD
Yeah: because they’re not your rackets. The racket is not yours. You are the rackets. The racket
owns you; you don’t own the racket.
JAKE
I came in with a chip on my shoulder too. You invited us to speak there at the beginning. I
thought I would ask a question that would really throw this guy about guests for the evening
session, and the money. This experience was a genuine experience and I owe you an apology
for that.
ERHARD
The apology is: You made this work for you.
JAKE
I did.
ERHARD
That makes us even.
(applause)
KIPP
Okay, we’re about to go on a break. Standing in the empty and meaninglessness of life, see if a
conversation for possibility, for participating in life...
ERHARD
Let’s not give them an assignment at this point. Just stay with the empty and meaningless, we’ll
talk about the rest of it when you get back.

Kipp handled a few logistical items (handing out seminar schedules for those who had received an
erroneous schedule, etc.). The course supervisor followed Kipp upon the stage to deliver several
announcements.
At 12:15 pm, The Forum adjourned for a break.

SPEAKING BEING
The Forgetting of Being, Part Seven of Eight: Logos
Are humans missing out on an important element of existence? How would we
know? How did this come about? Further, if this element is the experience of Being
that is available in The Forum, why does that experience occur as elusive—that is, as
something you get and lose and get and lose? To shed some light on these ques-
tions, we are following Heidegger’s history of Being.
As we proceed here, we invite you to read from the perspective that while
Heidegger’s project was supremely intellectual in its approach, it was not epistemo-
logical in nature: he did not want to help us to know more about Being, or to achieve
what we generally call a greater understanding. Rather, he wanted to create, through
thinking, a clearing for the presence of Being in the world. In his reading of the exist-
ing fragments of their writing, he finds evidence that the pre-Socratics experienced
this presence.
The Unconcealment of Being
The fifth and sixth centuries BCE were an extraordinary period in human evolu-
tion, giving rise to “a development in the art of philosophical inquiry that is quite
unparalleled in world history” (Wheelwright, The Presocratics 1). Language, by some
estimates, had entered our evolutionary path a million years earlier; and by the fifth
century, complex aspects of existence were emerging to be named, and dealt with.
There was a new level of demand for humans to understand themselves, and their
place in the world. The decisions made at this point, Heidegger says, have proven to
be decisive.
We have seen that for the Greeks, Being occurred as physis, the sway, an “over-
whelming coming-to-presence” of emerging possibilities. In a process of languaging
that Heidegger calls originary naming, the Greeks were engaged in a struggle to
create a world: “[T]his sway first steps forth from concealment—that is, in Greek,
aletheia (unconcealment) happens—insofar as the sway struggles itself forth as a
world. Through world, beings first come into being” (IM 67).
Physis, emerging as world, stands in the world in aletheia. Aletheia—
unconcealment—was for the Greeks self-blossoming appearance. Heidegger some-
times translated the word aletheia as “truth,” but at other times he was emphatic
that aletheia for the Greeks bore no relation to our usual notion of truth as the
correspondence of a proposition with its object. Aletheia, for the pre-Socratics, was
SESSION ONE INTERVAL
the truth of a being at its inception. To think aletheia, we must imagine an existential
moment—a moment of virginal emergence when a being is first available to be seen,
and thus first opened to being apprehended in the world before multiple perspec-
tives of its appearance have given rise to multiple propositions regarding its nature:
For the Greek essence of truth is possible only together
with the Greek essence of Being as physis. On the grounds
of the unique essential relationship between physis and
aletheia, the Greeks could say: beings as beings are true.
The true as such is in being. . . Truth belongs to the essence
of Being. (IM 112)
M
The idea challenges our thinking, immersed as we are in a persistent cacophony of
conflicting truth claims. But the view that beings as beings are essentially true was
grounded in a particular ontological/historical context: for the pre-Socratic thinkers,
physis was Being brought to stand in the world with beings, and in that context the
unconcealed beings stood in truth. The truth of beings was the truth of Being. We
cannot grasp that notion of truth—cannot imagine it, cannot bring it to thought—
because we have lost the requisite orientation to Being.
Truth as Freedom
Fundamental to that orientation, says Heidegger, is that the essence of its truth is
freedom. But this understanding of the situation calls for a shift in what our Western
tradition has considered to be the relation of freedom to truth. In that tradition,
freedom is a property of human beings, and consists in our freedom to say, and in
saying to judge what is true. This is the Cartesian model, with the balance of power
weighted on the side of the subject.
But now the emphasis in Heidegger’s view is the freedom that arises in
aletheia—in unconcealment, the freedom of the openness of the open region in
which beings are first revealed. This shift—from the freedom of the human sayer
to speak truth, to the freedom for beings to be the true things they are—is a central
movement in Heidegger’s later thinking: “Freedom now reveals itself as letting
beings be” (“OET” in BW 125). But this is not letting-be in the sense of neglecting, or
letting things alone. Here it means the opposite: “To let be is to engage oneself with
beings,” not by managing or planning but by an alert attunement to the open region
“into which every being comes to stand, bringing that openness, as it were, along
with itself” (“OET” in BW 125).
“
Forum Day Four: Session One Interval 373
Heidegger is distinguishing a delicate balance—a way of relating to the world
in which we neither impose ourselves upon, nor surrender to and lose ourselves in,
beings. Rather, we withdraw somewhat, so that “they might reveal themselves with
respect to what and how they are,” and so that we might find their truth in the event
of their unconcealment (“OET” in BW 125). In aletheia, Being appears in undistorted
emerging: “Considered in regard to the essence of truth, the essence of freedom
manifests itself as exposure to the disclosedness of beings” (“OET” in BW 126). Ale-
theia, says Heidegger, is “Revealing as the order at the start” (EP 65).
We note here that Werner Erhard has consistently avoided truth claims for his work,
emphasizing repeatedly that he does not know the truth. We propose, however, that
an experience of the truth of Being is a fundamental element of The Forum (see the
first sidebar in the next session, “The Three Levels of Truth”). It is hinted at through-
out the dialogue in the unspoken realm of the conversation, and culminates with
the evocation of the Nothing; but perhaps its most pertinent articulation is Erhard’s
distinction of integrity, which begins with this definition: integrity is “the state of be-
ing whole, complete, unbroken, unimpaired, sound, in perfect condition” (Erhard and
Jensen, “Putting Integrity into Finance: A Purely Positive Approach” 6).
This understanding of integrity is harmonic with phua, the root of the word
physis, which according to Heidegger means “what one originally and authentically
already is: that which essentially unfolds as having been, in contrast to the subse-
quently forced and enforced contrivances and fabrications” (IM 111). In the context
of their fundamental orientation to Being, beings were seen by the pre-Socratics as
originally true, a truth arising in the moment of their free emergence. Distortions of
their truth were subsequent to their unconcealment. This sense of Being as what
one originally and authentically is, we assert, is consistent with Erhard’s under-
standing of integrity, and the distinction of integrity is a fundamental element of the
transformation that The Forum makes available.
Logos: Primal Gathering
Emerging into the truth of unconcealment, physis is gathered in logos. According to
Heidegger, just as the original power of the Greek term physis has been lost, so has
the meaning of logos devolved over time. The traditional academic conception of
this term is that it concerns discourse of some kind—generally reason, assertion, or
logic. In Aristotle’s Rhetoric, for example, logos designated that category of evidence
in which a speaker uses evidence conducive to a given audience’s ability to reason,
making an argument persuasive to that audience.
But these interpretations are later derivations, since the fundamental meaning
of the term for the pre-Socratics had “no immediate relation to language” (IM 137).
Instead, logos, as legein, a form of the verb lego, meant originally to lay, to gather or
collect. Legein is to lay down, to lay before; logos signified the primal gathering principle.
As beings emerged from the sway and into the world, embryonic in their mean-
ing, fragile in their truth, the task to be undertaken was to preserve them in their
unconcealment and in their fundamental orientation to Being: “To be human,” writes
Heidegger, “means to gather, to gather and apprehend the Being of beings” (IM 194).
Naming is not something that follows the event of emergence. Rather, naming, as
originary saying, allows “the Being of beings” to be “opened up in the structure of its
gatheredness… Human beings, as those who stand and act in logos, in gathering, are
the gatherers” (IM 191). How can we think this idea of humans as gatherers? As we
read and listen, we gather letters to make words, gather words to make sentences, and
gather ideas to make sense. As we go through our lives we gather the hours to make a
day, and through time we gather days and years and events to make a life. In so doing,
we order these phenomena—the events of our lives—arranging them in our under-
standing to create narratives, stories filled with meaning, that serve to leave us looking
good and being right. Likewise, for the pre-Socratics, the gathering of logos brought
order to the upsurge of the sway: “Being as logos is originary gathering, not a heap
or a pile where everything counts just as much and just as little—and for this reason,
rank and dominance belong to Being” (IM 147). In logos, phenomena were arrayed as
a world, with differences, limits, and degrees of  importance.
But for the Greeks, there was an element in the gathering that we today have
difficulty comprehending: as “the originally gathering gatheredness that constantly
holds sway in itself,” logos “is constant gathering, the gatheredness of beings that
stands in itself, that is, Being” (IM 141, 145 emphasis added). The Greeks were not
merely gathering beings into the world, but were struggling to do so in a way that
retained each being’s origin: Being, the sway, the background in which it had been
concealed and out of which it had emerged in unconcealment.
Legein for the Greeks gathered the unconcealed into the world as it was
unconcealed. Only in this way can logos as authentic speaking be possible. It is the
letting-be of what is unconcealed in the open region of its unconcealment; and in
distinguishing this fragile phenomenon, Heidegger employs (as he often does) lan-
guaging whose poetic character respects its fragility:
374
SPEAKING BEING
The saying and talking of mortals comes to pass from early
on as legein, laying. Saying and talking occur essentially as
the letting-lie-together-before of everything which, laid in
unconcealment, comes to presence. (EGT 63)
T
[. . .] Such a letting-lie establishes whatever lies before us as
lying-before. It establishes this as itself., i.e., a letting-lie-before
of what does lie before us, gathered in the selfsameness of its
lying-before [. . .]. This exceptional laying is the legein which
comes to pass as the logos. (EGT 66)
T
This was the challenge for the first philosophers: to bring Being—the realm of
meaninglessness and possibility from which the meanings and possibilities were
made distinct—to stand in the world: “Physis and logos are the same. Logos char-
acterizes Being in a new and yet old respect: that which is in being, which stands
straight and prominently in itself, is gathered in itself and from itself, and holds itself
in such gathering” (IM 145).

SPEAKING BEING
When participants returned from the break at 1 pm, Wes and Kipp were on the platform.
WES (referring to a minor earthquake that happened during the break)
Did you notice that coming from empty and meaningless, an earthquake is just an earthquake?
(some participants raising their hands)
Okay. Wait a second. We’re going to extend an invitation to you that makes sense when you can
come from dwelling in empty and meaningless. We invite you to a campaign, a campaign against
reasonableness. We’re inviting you into a campaign to destroy reasonableness in your life.
(applause)
So we have a question for you so you can confront what the campaign would mean and what
it would look like in your life. Look now at the reasons you have for not participating in life. So
you’re looking through the areas of your life where there has been no participation, and instead
of participation, there have been reasons for not. You have to actually start going through your
life. When you are looking from where we are in The Forum now, you can see things you didn’t
see before. And you’re looking at where there could have been participation, and there wasn’t
and isn’t. And all there is are reasons for not. What new openings are there for participation?
Preston, who spoke at length at the beginning of Session Two of Day Three, stood and took a micro-
phone.
PRESTON
I knew before I got here that I was not going to be allowed to take notes.
KIPP
Right.
PRESTON
This is like: I don’t know of a greater threat to me.
KIPP
An enormous threat.
PRESTON
I’m running my racket, but I’m running it like a coyote through the back roads. And I noticed
on the fi rst day that no one had said, “no notes.” We hadn’t gotten to the promises, so we were
in the pre-promised land, and I’m making my notes. You know, nugget following nugget, which
I can eventually read later when my brain will at least serve me for that because I don’t trust my
brain. So I’m suddenly confronted with the fact that I really haven’t promised that I’ll keep the
promises, but I’ve been keeping them so far because that’s what I’m doing so far.
FORUM DAY FOUR:
SESSION TWO
Forum Day Four: Session Two
377
KIPP
You mean you’re not taking notes, so far.
PRESTON
I made a few notes in pen on my wrist when I just couldn’t bear it.
(laughter)r
KIPP
Really? You made notes on your wrist? Really?
PRESTON
And then I go out on the break and wash it very carefully.
(laughter)r
It was a little bit like smoking dope as a kid in the bathroom, where you have to clear it out with
the spray, but everybody knows you can’t make such a sweet smell when you’re taking a shit.
(laughter)r
But I’m here to keep my promises and I haven’t been taking notes. And I realize this is what
I’ve been running in my life up until now. One of the elements of structure here is how I’ve
survived, totally by taking notes: I have notebooks; I have reference books in my notebooks, but
I probably can’t fi nd them because I haven’t labeled them properly. So I noticed in a passing
thought that I’ve kept all these notes but I can’t access any of them very well. That’s not story,
that’s a fact. So I have given up what has kept me afl oat. And by yesterday I was willing to do it.
I’ve only made one note, just three words, which I washed off  before looking at it.
(laughter)r
And from what Werner said this morning, that is my apology. So I’ve been looking at what I
haven’t been able to keep myself in, now that I haven’t got any notes, and feeling that some-
thing is—there is a piece that hasn’t been coming together for me yet, like many others here.
I was able to get my fi nger on the piece because I wasn’t taking notes about it. And the piece
was “boxes,” and I was helped by one of the people on staff  who said to me after the last session,
“Structure is a great supporter of promises.” When you have structure, it helps you to stay on
purpose with your promise. I began to see that the boxes are where you apply structure, where
I apply structure. I went out and had a look at my life and looked at the cracks in the pavement,
because that’s my way, and I saw a sign over a parking lot that said “validation.” It winks on
twice and then goes black. I wondered how far the energy of this room extends?
(laughter)r
I realized that the stronger my stand in emptiness and absence of meaning; the stronger my
stand in that place, the more I’ll be able to utilize structure.
The Three Levels of Truth
Martin Heidegger’s purpose as a philosopher was to bring the truth
of Being to presence in the human experience.  It is diff icult to
imagine just what that would look like, or what it might make pos-
sible, since it has for the most part been missing for us; and when it
has shown up, it has not stuck around for long. Why?

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
The more you come from life being empty and meaningless.
PRESTON
Yes. It’s a total paradox. All you can do is what Werner seems to do, is just repeat it over and
over and over again. And three people get up and he repeats it over and over again. I’m walk-
ing along and this thing goes: “validation.” And I see that there’s something for me inside that
space I’m trying to stand in now, that I’ve been instructed to stand in, rather than doing an
exercise. And what I fi nd in it is something in my own terminology, because I love language as
distinction—that is where I cross humbly with Werner’s path: that’s my martial art, my practice.
And I found that there was something already in that emptiness that didn’t leave it somehow
and maybe it could stay with me and help me bridge my way back to that part of myself—it’s
what I would call trust and innocence, and what I mean by innocence for myself is not naïve,
it’s just readiness—kind of a readiness state—a trust I also reached yesterday. So in a way I’ve
pulled the fl oor up under my feet another few inches by being with structure, by being willing
to be boxed, by boxing myself. And it occurred to me—since that is something that hadn’t been
brought up a lot in the talk—maybe it was something because of the time squeeze and the pres-
sures and what goes on could have had on another occasion, in another format, a little more
time to it. And I thought that if that was what was missing for me and I could fi t it in, then I
could guess what Werner was going to do next.
KIPP
The danger of the conversation, Preston—I’m not saying the conversation is dangerous the way
you are saying it, but the danger is you making that into an answer.
PRESTON
I would say it was just a thought. It was what happened in my head as I was watching the “vali-
dating” sign. I don’t take any of this personally.
KIPP
Or like an answer.
PRESTON
No, it’s just what is happening as I am doing some thinking rather than being thought.
KIPP
Very nice. Okay.
PRESTON
And the last thought about this. What had happened to me was a set of distinctions. I had made
choice after choice after choice so it seems the place I’m at in my Forum is being with choice.
Not making choice an answer even...
Heidegger says that Being comes to presence as Augenblick, a
moment of vision—an all-at-once gestalt switch in which we leap
suddenly onto new ground, where everything is diff erent. But the
gift  of Being comes with non-negotiable conditions. First, the leap
cannot be accomplished unless the appropriate time and space
are created for the necessary run-up. Second, the new ground will
be revealed as the old ground, the familiar ground upon which we
have been standing all along, but will be apprehended in a pro-
foundly new light.  Third, in this new light, the ground is not solid
in the way we have always counted on ground to be; therefore
we must open ourselves to a new level of uncertainty, which also
means a new level of ontological freedom. The action of the run-
up is always the teasing-open of old ground, so that a background
can be revealed.
For Heidegger then, and likewise for Werner Erhard, trans-
formed human existence already is; its freedom has always already
been available to us. But we rarely experience its power because we
have not appropriated it—that is, we have not authentically accepted
and taken ownership of our existence. “Being” is a fuzzy concept for
us; it is not a distinct realm. Therefore the run-up occurs as a gradual
process in which we distinguish the old ground—our current Being-
in-the-world—as itself, so that we can own it for what it is. This is
the essential first step in achieving transformation, and the process
occupies the first three days of The Forum.
A fundamental distinction in this process is the distinction of
distinction itself.f  In this section we will cut another path into that
clearing.
Aletheia
One of the terms by which Heidegger distinguished the ontolog-
ical dimension is the Greek word Aletheia, or unconcealment.
This word, for Heidegger and for the pre-Socratics, says the free
openness in which beings are first revealed. The term has oft en
been understood as denoting truth; but this is not to be mistak-
en as the “truth” of our current everyday understanding, as the
correspondence of an assertion with its object; that kind of truth
is at best a shadow of what is meant by this ancient Greek word.

KIPP
Yeah.
PRESTON
But being with it so that I can operate from the box I call choice.
KIPP
When we get to this conversation about choice, being with choice, we’ll come back to that one.
Okay. Anything more for you, Preston?
PRESTON
No.
KIPP
Thank you.
(applause)
KIPP
So, we’re asking you to look at where in your life you have had reasons for not participating,
that’s the question at hand. And we’re distinguishing this distinction called reasonableness.
BARRY
It’s been entirely reasonable for me to keep myself distinct from people. Separate, not distinct.
KIPP
Yeah, separate.
BARRY
There’s a sense of being protected, of protecting myself. I feel like I’m not going to get sucked
into things that I don’t want to get sucked into. I choose the game; I choose the way it’s played.
KIPP
By the way, you don’t choose it.
BARRY
I decide what game to play...
KIPP
You use the evidence that’s given to you by your racket, and examine that evidence, and the
product of that evidence has you do what you do. And the product of that evidence is “lots of
reasons.”
When we are there with a being in the moment of its undistorted
emerging, prior to assertions—that begins to get at what is meant
by Aletheia: a free way of encountering beings that allows them to
be the things they are.
However, according to Thomas Sheehan, in his book Making
Sense of Heidegger, there are not just two, but three ways in which
Heidegger treats Aletheia, which will prove useful in an analysis of
The Forum’s methodology. We remind the reader, as we have done
throughout this book, that we are talking about a realm that has
no levels. When talking about the realm of Being, Werner Erhard
has said, all we can do is lie (“All I Can Do Is Lie.”). But that does not
mean we should stop talking, and Thomas Sheehan has opened
some interesting possibilities for thinking. Sheehan proposes that
Aletheia may be thought of as having three levels—that is, that
there are three ways of understanding what Heidegger meant
when dealing with the “truth”:
Aletheia 1, Aletheia 2, and Aletheia 3.
Aletheia 3 refers to the correctness of a statement—the
correspondence of a proposition with the state of aff airs to which
it refers. This definition glosses many aspects of evaluation and
judgment, of course, but it is what we generally mean when we
use the word “truth” in our everyday conversations. Aletheia 3
also indicates the average level of truth we expect in our everyday
coping in the world, and it is the kind of truth that operates within
our “stories.”
Aletheia 2 is the pre-propositional meaningful presence of
things in the world, the realm of inescapable meaning in which
we live our lives. For human beings, everything means something,
that is, can be understood as something. Aletheia 2 is the kind of
truth that emerges when participants distinguish “what hap-
pened” as distinct from their story about what happened.
Aletheia 1 is existential openness, the realm of unspoken
meaninglessness. This is the context for the other two realms, and
Sheehan calls this context the “unique presence-by-absence of the
thrown-open clearing” (Thomas Sheehan, Making Sense of Heideg-
ger 75). This is the groundless ground of our humanity, Being’s gift :
r
the Nothing.
380
SPEAKING BEING
BARRY
Loads of them.
KIPP
Yes.
BARRY
And I noticed yesterday in the danger process that I took from that, that my experience of that,
what I created was that my experience was shallow, that I was shallow, my emotional states in
both directions were. And...
KIPP
You don’t have much range of participation for yourself?
BARRY
Yes, I inherently limit that. And the idea of terror, although I know it’s true, I didn’t even have a
direct experience of that, so I had an experience of not having an experience of that.
KIPP
In place of a reason for not having it...
BARRY
Well, up to that point, yes. And even at that point. I said “Okay, that’s a reason. And this is me,
and this is now, and here I am, and let that be for the fi rst time.” And a big part of the story of
the racket had been that I just don’t feel deep emotions.
KIPP
Yeah, “you know me. I just don’t feel them. Some people got ’em, some people don’t.”
BARRY
And I don’t like it but it’s safer than having them. So I got to “Okay that’s where I am.” And
kind of cooked along in it and noticed that for me my thoughts are like one of those signs that
gives you the news while you’re standing in line at the deli, that makes you dizzy when you
watch it too long.
KIPP
It’s not limited to you, by the way.
BARRY
And I noticed there was really no diff erence as they were coming by as they did, and by not
ascribing signifi cance to any of those thoughts and letting them be there, I just noticed that
Erhard’s methodology of inquiry, a strategic recursive practice
iterated in each conversation with each participant, discloses the
Being of human being beyond the everyday propositional level
(Aletheia 3
(
). In order to accomplish this, the level of “truth” called
Aletheia 3 must first be distinguished as itself—as the level of un-
f
committed understandings of the world: the justifications, reasons,
explanations, and prescriptions regarding the circumstances of
one’s life and the strategies enacted to deal with those circumstanc-
es, what in The Forum is distinguished as one’s story. It is to this
level of truth that Erhard refers when he declares that he does not
know the truth, as any statement taken as an assertion to be used
in some way in-order-to already has lost any of its truth value.
In the process of distinguishing Aletheia 3 as Aletheia 3, as story,
a further background becomes accessible as the background from
which Aletheia 3 is disclosed. This further background is Aletheia
2, which in the conversation of The Forum is the what happened.
As the smokescreen of our crystallized stories dissipates, Aletheia
2 becomes distinguished from the “truth” of Aletheia 3, the level of
truth in which “what happened” has heretofore been held. What
was formerly the “truth” becomes disclosed as an interpretation
forgotten as such, an interpretation that can never reach the “what
happened.” At this new level of truth, what happened becomes
d
opened up as what happened, and now unhinged, so to speak,
from the narrow meaning the story had framed it within. Thereby
whatever happened becomes open to be taken a multitude of ways;
it becomes possible to see that there could be many ways to make
“what happened” meaningful, and to see that we will never be able
to speak a single truth concerning what happened.
What makes distinguishing Aletheia 3 and Aletheia 2 possible
is the background of the unspoken realm of Being, Aletheia 1, the
background of meaninglessness, of Nothing, in which our world of
meaning arises. That is to say, the reiterative acts of distinguishing in
language “story” and “what happened” already and always evokes
“life is empty and meaningless, and it is empty and meaningless
that life is empty and meaningless” as the background context, or
clearing for meaningful presence. We cannot grasp the nature of a
Forum Day Four: Session Two
381
without saying anything, or directly about it, that I felt more intimate with the people that were
sharing in the group and that emotions were starting to well right up out of me. And I know I
can take that and be reasonable and say “Oh, that’s great, I’ll do this now all the time and I’ll
have these emotions and everything will be fi xed.” And hey, I’m feeling it.
KIPP
When you do.
BARRY
I am right now. I may not tonight or I may not tomorrow. Now I am.
KIPP
You always will when you do.
BARRY
I’m there.
KIPP
Thank you very much.
(applause)
So, we’re distinguishing this distinction called reasonableness. Is it so that in life you either
have the results or the reasons for not having them? And is it also so that as a human being, the
way it is to be a human being, is if you give yourself a suffi  cient reason that you also give equal
weight to that? That’s enough reason for not having this result. So if the result doesn’t occur,
where do you immediately look? At the reason why it didn’t. So we’re asking where in your life
do you have reasons for not participating. Please...
SANFORD
Well, sharing is one of them. For the fi rst day and a half in here I was sitting on a lot of shares,
I had lots of reasons, you know, the golden share, the whole bit. So now I have reasons for
sharing, so there’s really no way of getting away from either one. But beyond that, I’ve had
reasons for not choosing a career, for not living into the full possibility of what life could be for
me. Reasons for not keeping promises—made some promises to people back in Seattle about
being in communication with people in The Forum about various things around the work, and
just everywhere, everywhere I look. There are reasons for doing things and not doing it. When I
produce results I have reasons for getting the results. If I don’t get the results I have reasons for
not getting them, but if I get results I have reasons for getting them.
KIPP
Okay. Anything else?
truth except from a perspective beyond that truth, and that perspec-
tive must be created and discovered for oneself as one lives within
the rhetorical dialogue of The Forum as it unfolds. Participants of The
Forum are called, again and again, to stand in another perspective
given by a level of truth altogether diff erent from the level from
which life is ordinarily understood—as story, as Aletheia 3. However,
when someone speaks Being, names the primordial clearing that we
are, it can only be done at the level of “you do what you do and you
don’t do what you don’t do.” The continuing creation and expan-
sion of this perspective—of unconcealment—is the work of Werner
Erhard since the inception of the est Training.
t
But how does this unconcealment happen in The Forum?
We call attention to the environment of authenticity that has
been created in The Forum room over the past three days—first,
through disclosing the fundamental inauthenticity of human
beings through the discursive acts of distinguishing story and
what happened, racket, and so on; second, through disclosing
sharing as a particular way of communicating; and third, through
the authentic sharing itself that has emerged in the participants’
interactions with Erhard and the other Forum leaders.
In this environment, a new level of unconcealment becomes
possible as stories begin to be heard as stories—even by the indi-
viduals telling them, those whose lives have been shaped and lim-
ited by the “truth” of their stories. Too angry and afraid to reveal
it, Marsha had maintained the deception of having it all together,
which began to “make her thin”; Angel decided as a child that she
would be the most caring person in the world as a way to over-
come her fear of not really caring at all; Mike became stupid and in
need of the help of others as a response to experiencing himself as
incompetent; Jane hides out to avoid experiencing the embarrass-
ment of rejection due to being worthless. These are disclosures,
openings only possible from a point of view from which story and
what happened are distinct and uncollapsed. Thus, as the shaping
power of the stories begins to waver, the presence of the underly-
ing circumstances emerges with a new clarity; simultaneously, a
new freedom to be emerges.
382
SPEAKING BEING
SANFORD
Yeah. The question was reasons for not participating. I have a lot of reasons for not participating
in the assisting program.
KIPP
Everybody know he’s referring to the people who have been running microphones and man-
aging this entire program? Those are assistants in a program. You’ll have an opportunity to
acknowledge them later. Thank you. Go ahead.
SANFORD
So, I’m not sure there’s a lot of value going into what those reasons are, but the cost of having
those reasons instead of assisting is that, number one, I don’t have available to me whatever
would be there for me out of assisting and I’m ripping everybody else off  from what I could
contribute by doing that.
KIPP
Yeah. What you’ve got is your reasons.
SANFORD
Yeah. And if I continue to indulge myself in that, at the end of my life that’s what I’ll have is all
the reasons for what I did and what I didn’t do instead of powerful results.
KIPP
And that’s what most people got.
SANFORD
Yeah. Probably what everybody’s got; possibly what everybody’s got.
KIPP
Yeah, well, you talk to a lot of people and pretty much this is what people tell you about their
life: “I would have, if...”
f
SANFORD
Yeah, that’s my story for sure.
KIPP
Sanford, thank you. Anabeth?
(applause)
ANABETH
The reasons for not participating go back a long way. So I can see that now. Earlier when Werner
was talking about when we were six or fi ve or four, whenever that happened, and my reaction
Fallenness
Nevertheless, stories have power. The meaningfulness of these
interpretations has provided the practical understanding by which
we have coped with the circumstances in our lives. As Erhard puts
it in Session Three of Day Four, our actions are always in a dance
with the way the world occurs. But while we remain immersed in
the oblivion of Aletheia 3, the dance is inauthentic. We do not own
the reality we are living because we have not chosen it; nor have
we chosen not to choose it. We have merely fallen into the drift
t
of the dance that has been thrown-open for us; and rather than
confront the situation, we flee into the tranquillizing distractions
of the “they.”
The inevitable forgetfulness of the “they” self—the forget-
ting of Being that follows the unconcealment of one’s story as a
story—is what Heidegger termed “fallenness.” Thomas Sheehan
in Making Sense of Heidegger writes that fallenness is a kind of
r
forgetting that results from focusing on what is meaningful to
us: “the more I focus on the meaningful, the more I forget that I
am the thrown-open clearing that makes meaning possible and
necessary” (116): we forget Aletheia 1 and Aletheia 2 and devolve
to the order of truth given by fallenness, that is, by Aletheia 3.
The conversation of The Forum is designed to bring the partici-
pants to Nothing, the thrown-open clearing of Aletheia 1, which is
possible only through undergoing the experience of the dialogue
for oneself as it moves backwards from truth as Aletheia 3 to
Aletheia 2, which already brings to presence Aletheia 1. Again and
again and again.
For instance, during his conversation with Jodie during Ses-
sion Two of Day Two, Erhard brought Jodie and all the participants
to think and
k
experience for themselves these three levels. To Jodie’s
recognition of her story as a story—that boys did not like her when
she was a little girl—Erhard said, “a story is just a story”—a point of
view of Aletheia 3 only granted us when “standing in” or “coming
from” Aletheia 2. When Erhard continues to say that “The ‘what
happened’ is what’s true or not. It did or it didn’t,” he is speaking
from the point of view of the thrown-open clearing given by Ale-
theia 1 as it regards Aletheia 2 and Aletheia 3. Erhard continued:

اولین کاری که حقیقت انجام خواهد داد این است که شما را از بین ببرد. آیا متوجه مردم اینجا نشده اید؟ گلوریا (خنده)
به دلیل همین تقریباً دیشب وارد یک فیله شدم. درز
به خاطر حقیقت؟ گلخانه
به خاطر آن خالی و بی معنی بود. او یک شخص کارمندان انجمن بود ، بنابراین این واقعاً من را رقم زد
می خواهم او را مشت کنم. درز
این حقیقت را به گه تبدیل می کند. چگونه می تواند خالی و بی معنی چیزی ایجاد کند؟ گلوریا (مراجعه به سالی)
آنچه او در مورد "لعنتی" گفت.
درز
اما این خالی و بی معنی نیست که شما به اینجا رسیدید. این خالی و معنی است-
کمتر در سمینار در آن طرف دیوار قرار گرفتید. کسی که شما 625 دلار برای آن پرداخت کرده اید ، این کار را نکردید
آن یکی را دریافت کنید. شما ارزان قیمت را گرفتید ، یکی از آنها را دریافت کردید که هزینه ای ندارد. 625 دلار
هیچ نسخه ای به شما نمی دهد ، چیزی را توجیه نمی کند. ببینید ، شما می خواهید از آن برای توجیه استفاده کنید
چیزی را درست است؟ گلخانه
بله درز
شما فکر می کنید که توجیهی انجام نمی دهد ، اما این خالی و بی معنی نیست که ما صحبت می کنیم
درباره اینجا خالی و بی معنی که ما در اینجا صحبت می کنیم توجیهی نیست. وت
آنچه شما را آزار می دهد این است که تمام زندگی شما را باطل می کند زیرا شما یک "مسیحی برنج" هستید.
شما برای کار کار نکردید. 368

گلخانه
من به کلیسا نمی روم. درز
بله ، شما یک "مسیحی برنج" هستید. من اهمیتی نمی دهم که شما به کلیسا بروید یا نه ، شما "برنج"
مسیحی. " شما برای کار کردن کار نمی کنید.
این انسان است همه ما انسان هستیم درز
نعل اسب ، انسان. این تله است ببینید ، شما فقط از حقیقت برای توجیه چیزی استفاده کرده اید. شما همه را گرفتید
حقیقت خارج از آن. بله ، کاملاً انسانی است و هیچ چیز توجیهی ندارد ، هیچ چیز را توضیح نمی دهد ، و اگر این کار را انجام دهد
چیزی را توجیه یا توضیح دهید که دیگر حقیقت نیست. این فقط برخی از کاتیون های توجیهی احمقانه است. گلخانه
من نمی توانم از آن استفاده کنم. درز
نه ، زیرا شما هنوز آن را دریافت نکرده اید. گلخانه
خوب درز
گلوریا باید این احساس بد را پشت سر بگذارید. شما احساس بدی می کنید و متوقف می شوید. شما باید
تمام راه را از طریق احساس بد پیش بروید. این را گرفتی؟ شما باید تمام راه را طی کنید
آن شما هنوز چیزی در آنجا دارید. شما هنوز خالی و بی معنی نیستید. شما
به "خالی و بی معنی و این بد است." این همه از طریق آن نیست. پاک کردن؟ گلخانه
بله درز
خوب برای شما (تشویق)
جیک؟ در اولین روز انجمن ، جیک ، یک معمار ، شرکت کننده ای بود که "عجله در انتظار آن بود
اتفاق می افتد ، "و چه کسی همچنین" پای خود را به سمت زمین "در رابطه با صداقت و عدم اعتماد به نفس داشت. روز چهارم: جلسه یک
369
جیک
من قصد داشتم در مورد حقیقت بپرسم ، اما شما قبلاً به این سوال پاسخ داده اید. اما من هم می خواستم
کمی در مورد راکت من به اشتراک بگذارید. من می خواستم از شما تشکر کنم به نظر می رسد که شما کمی بیشتر می دانید
درباره من از آنچه انتظار داشتم من از آن قدردانی می کنم درز
من از انسان بودن می دانم. جیک
برای من به نظر می رسد که شما می دانید حرفه من چیست. من یک حرفه جذاب دارم. آن را ایجاد می کند
من جذاب تر درز
من احترام عمیقی به حرفه شما دارم. و من احتمالاً احترام بیشتری به آن دارم
بیشتر افرادی که این کار را می کنند. من آن را به عنوان یک افتتاح بسیار ، بسیار مهم برای بشریت می بینم. وت
من می دانم که افراد حرفه ای شما نیز وجود دارند که حرفه شما را نیز از این طریق می بینند ، اما
تعداد زیادی از آنها در آنجا چیز بسیار مهمی وجود دارد که بشریت هنوز کشف نکرده است. من
احترام عمیقی برای طراحی داشته باشید. یک احترام عمیق و این یک راز است که من نمی گیرم. اما خاص شما-
حرفه Ular مکان بدی برای کشف رمز و راز طراحی نخواهد بود. اما کاوش در
رمز و راز طراحی متفاوت از انجام طراحی است. جیک
و این همان کاری است که من می خواهم انجام دهم ، اما داشتن آن به عنوان یک راکت فقط همه چیز را فریب می دهد. و من انتخاب کردم
این حرفه زیرا این یک حرفه جذاب بود. من آن را انتخاب کردم زیرا به کار احتیاج داشتم. من می آیم
از یک خانواده بسیار تحصیل کرده ، و یک بار فکر می کردم که می خواهم یک ضربه بزنم. درز
و شما در برابر آن تصمیم گرفتید. جیک
بله ، من در برابر آن تصمیم گرفتم ، بنابراین به مدرسه رفتم. من حرفه ای گرفتم: مدرک و مجوز. وت
من به اندازه کافی خوش شانس بودم که حرفه ای را انتخاب کنم ، که اکنون هیجان انگیز است ، اما واقعاً لعنتی
راه - اگر این گه های دیگر را از این راه خارج کنم ، می تواند بسیار هیجان انگیز تر باشد. درز
دقیقاً این خیلی خوب است من و جیک تعامل کافی برای چیز مفید برای
اینجا اتفاق می افتد ببینید من می دانم که در ابتدا به طور خاص به نظر می رسد - و هنوز هم برای برخی از شما هنوز هم است
به نظر می رسد-هر آنچه من می گویم توهین است ، هر آنچه می گویم یک فرومایه است. من می دانم که
برخی از شما این را برای مردم توصیف خواهید کرد که "آنها من را بد نامیدند" ؛ "آنها مرا کتک زدند" ؛
"آنها اجازه نمی دهند از حمام استفاده کنم" ؛ "او گفت" لعنتی "و اینگونه رفت."

erhard (به خنده ، ساختن یک ژست با دستانش که نشانگر عمل جنسی است)
من واقعاً تصدیق کردم که وقتی من و جیک اول شروع به صحبت کردیم ، که تعداد زیادی از آنها وجود دارد
طلسم در این اتاق. من شما را به عنوان یک آسفالت صدا نکردم زیرا نمی دانستم که شما همکار هستید
دلپذیر من می دانستم که شما موفق شده اید و من شما را یک آسفالت صدا کردم. همانطور که جیک گفت: چیزهای زیادی وجود دارد
رضایت از آنچه او انجام می دهد و احتمال رضایت بسیار بیشتری در آنچه او وجود دارد
انجام می دهد. این همان چیزی است که Asshole در مورد آن بود. این به معنای ناراحتی شما نبود. به طور کامل گفته شد
آگاهی از موفقیت شما این خیلی توهین آمیز از آنچه فکر می کردید بود ، اما این بود
به معنای انکار نیست. با آگاهی کامل گفته شد که شما موفق شده اید و چیزهای زیادی وجود دارد
بیشتر وجود دارد. جیک
این یک تجربه عالی بوده است. من بسیاری از میکروفون را به سرقت بردم - گفتگوی یکی دیگر از راکت ها است. من
هر راکت را در این اتاق گرفت. و فکر می کنم همه افراد دیگر در این اتاق همه راکت ها را دارند ... erhard
بله: زیرا آنها راکت شما نیستند. راکت مال شما نیست. شما راکت ها هستید. راکت
صاحب شما است شما صاحب راکت نیستید. جیک
من هم با یک تراشه روی شانه ام وارد شدم. شما از ما دعوت کردید که در ابتدا در آنجا صحبت کنیم. من
فکر می کردم سوالی می پرسم که واقعاً این مرد را در مورد مهمانان برای عصر پرتاب می کند
جلسه ، و پول. این تجربه یک تجربه واقعی بود و من به شما عذرخواهی می کنم
برای آن درز
عذرخواهی این است: شما این کار را برای خود ساخته اید. جیک
من انجام دادم درز
این ما را یکدست می کند. (تشویق)

خوب ، ما در حال استراحت هستیم. ایستادن در خالی و بی معنی زندگی ، ببینید آیا
مکالمه برای امکان ، برای شرکت در زندگی ... erhard
بیایید در این مرحله به آنها وظیفه نداریم. فقط با خالی و بی معنی بمانید ، ما خواهیم ماند
هنگام بازگشت ، در مورد بقیه آن صحبت کنید. روز چهارم: جلسه یک

فراموشی بودن بودن ، قسمت هفت از هشت: آرم
آیا انسانها از عنصر مهم وجود خود را از دست نمی دهند؟ ما چگونه خواهیم بود
می دانید؟ چگونه این اتفاق افتاد؟ علاوه بر این ، اگر این عنصر تجربه بودن باشد
که در انجمن موجود است ، چرا این تجربه به عنوان گریزان اتفاق می افتد - یعنی ،
چیزی که می گیرید و از دست می دهید و می گیرید و از دست می دهید؟ برای روشن کردن برخی از این سؤالات-
ما ، ما از تاریخ بودن هایدگر پیروی می کنیم. همانطور که در اینجا پیش می رویم ، ما از شما دعوت می کنیم از این دیدگاه که در حالی که
پروژه هایدگر در رویکرد خود کاملاً روشنفکرانه بود ، این معرفتی نبود
منطقی از نظر طبیعت: او نمی خواست به ما کمک کند تا درباره وجود یا دستیابی بیشتر بدانیم
آنچه ما به طور کلی درک بیشتری می نامیم. در عوض ، او می خواست ، از طریق
فکر کردن ، پاکسازی برای حضور در جهان. در خواندن او از وجود-
او با استفاده از بخش هایی از نوشتن آنها ، شواهدی را پیدا می کند که پیش از سونوکراتیک تجربه کرده است
این حضور عدم وجود بودن
قرن پنجم و ششم قبل از میلاد یک دوره فوق العاده در تکامل انسان بود
با این وجود "پیشرفت در هنر تحقیق فلسفی که کاملاً است
در تاریخ جهان بی نظیر است "(ویلسرایت ، پیش بینی 1). زبان ، توسط برخی
تخمین ها ، یک میلیون سال قبل وارد مسیر تکاملی ما شده بود. و تا پنجم
قرن ، جنبه های پیچیده وجود در حال ظهور بود و به آنها رسیدگی شد. سطح جدیدی از تقاضا برای انسان برای درک خود و آنها وجود داشت
مکان در جهان. هایدگر می گوید ، تصمیماتی که در این مرحله گرفته شده است ، ثابت کرده است
تعیین کننده باشید ما دیده ایم که برای یونانیان ، به عنوان فیزیک ، نوسان ، "بیش از حد" رخ داده است
در حال حاضر از امکانات در حال ظهور.
که هایدگر نامگذاری اصلی را می نامد ، یونانیان درگیر مبارزه بودند
جهانی ایجاد کنید: "اولین قدم های او را از پنهان کردن - یعنی به زبان یونانی ،
Aletheia (عدم تحرک) اتفاق می افتد - در حالی که خودشان به عنوان یک تلاش می کنند
جهان در سراسر جهان ، موجودات برای اولین بار به وجود می آیند. "(IM 67)
Unconcealment-برای ظاهر خود در برابر یونانیان بود. هایدگر برخی-
بارها کلمه aletheia را به عنوان "حقیقت" ترجمه می کرد ، اما در بعضی مواقع او تأکید می کرد
که Aletheia برای یونانیان هیچ ارتباطی با مفهوم معمول ما از حقیقت به عنوان
مکاتبات گزاره با شیء آن. Aletheia ، برای پیش از سوكراتیک ها ، بود
جلسه یک بازه
حقیقت وجود در آغاز آن. برای فکر کردن آلتیا ، ما باید یک وجودی را تصور کنیم
لحظه - لحظه ای از ظهور باکره هنگامی که یک موجود برای اولین بار در دسترس است ،
و بدین ترتیب برای اولین بار باز شد تا قبل از چند دیدگاه در جهان دستگیر شود
از نظر ظاهری آن ، چندین گزاره در مورد ماهیت آن ایجاد کرده است:
برای ذات یونانی حقیقت فقط با هم امکان پذیر است
با ذات یونانی بودن به عنوان فیزیک. به دلایل
از رابطه اساسی منحصر به فرد بین فیزیک و
آلتیا ، یونانیان می توانند بگویند: موجودات به عنوان موجودات صادق هستند. واقعیت به همین ترتیب در وجود است. بشر بشر حقیقت متعلق به ذات است
از وجود (من 112)
مگس
این ایده ، تفکر ما را به چالش می کشد ، غوطه ور می شود همانطور که ما در یک کاکوفونی مداوم هستیم
ادعای حقیقت متناقض. اما این دیدگاه که موجودات به عنوان موجودات در اصل صادق هستند
مبتنی بر یک زمینه خاص هستی شناختی/تاریخی: برای متفکران پیش از سوکراسی ،
Physis با موجودات و در این زمینه در جهان ایستاده بود
موجودات غیرقانونی در حقیقت ایستاده بودند. حقیقت موجودات حقیقت وجود بود. ما
نمی توان آن مفهوم حقیقت را درک کرد - آن را تصور کنید ، نمی تواند آن را به فکر بیاندازد
زیرا ما جهت گیری لازم را به وجود خود از دست داده ایم. حقیقت به عنوان آزادی
هایدگر می گوید ، اساسی برای آن جهت گیری این است که جوهر حقیقت آن است
آزادی اما این درک از وضعیت خواستار تغییر در آنچه در غرب ما است
سنت رابطه آزادی با حقیقت را در نظر گرفته است. در آن سنت ،
آزادی خاصیت انسانها است و شامل آزادی ما برای گفتن است ، و در
گفتن برای قضاوت در مورد آنچه درست است. این مدل دکارتی است ، با تعادل قدرت
وزنه برداری در کنار موضوع. اما اکنون تأکید بر دیدگاه هایدگر آزادی است که در آن بوجود می آید
Aletheia - در عدم موفقیت ، آزادی باز بودن منطقه باز در
برای اولین بار موجودات آشکار می شوند. این تغییر - از آزادی سیری انسان
برای گفتن حقیقت ، به آزادی برای موجودات چیزهای واقعی که هستند - یک مرکز است
حرکت در تفکر بعدی هایدگر: "آزادی اکنون خود را به عنوان اجازه نشان می دهد
موجودات "(" OET "در BW 125). اما این به معنای غفلت اجازه نمی دهد.
اجازه دادن به همه چیز در اینجا به معنای برعکس است: "اجازه دادن به این است که خود را درگیر کنید
موجودات ، "نه با مدیریت یا برنامه ریزی بلکه با توجه به هشدار به منطقه باز
"که در آن هر موجودی ایستاده و آن باز بودن را همانطور که در آن بود ، به ارمغان می آورد
با خودش "(" OET "در BW 125)."
روز چهارم: جلسه یک بازه 373
هایدگر یک تعادل ظریف را متمایز می کند - روشی برای ارتباط با جهان
که در آن نه خودمان را تحمیل می کنیم و نه تسلیم می شویم و خود را از دست می دهیم ،
موجودات در عوض ، ما تا حدودی عقب نشینی می کنیم ، به طوری که "آنها ممکن است خود را آشکار کنند
احترام به آنچه و آنها چگونه هستند ، "و به این ترتیب که ممکن است حقیقت آنها را در این رویداد پیدا کنیم
از عدم موفقیت آنها ("OET" در BW 125). در Aletheia ، حضور در بی نظیر ظاهر می شود
در حال ظهور: "با توجه به ذات حقیقت ، جوهر آزادی در نظر گرفته شده است
خود را به عنوان قرار گرفتن در معرض افشاگری موجودات "(" OET "در BW 126) نشان می دهد.
هایدگر می گوید ، تیا "در ابتدا به عنوان نظم آشکار می شود" (قسمت 65). ما در اینجا توجه می کنیم که ورنر ارهارد به طور مداوم از ادعاهای حقیقت برای کار خود جلوگیری کرده است ،
با تأکید بر مکرر که او حقیقت را نمی داند. با این حال ، ما پیشنهاد می کنیم که
تجربه حقیقت هستی یک عنصر اساسی انجمن است (به
نوار کناری اول در جلسه بعدی ، "سه سطح حقیقت"). از طریق
گفتگو در قلمرو ناگفته مکالمه ، و به اوج می رسد
برانگیختن هیچ چیز ؛ اما شاید مهمترین بیان آن Erhard باشد
تمایز یکپارچگی ، که با این تعریف آغاز می شود: یکپارچگی "وضعیت وجود دارد
در شرایط کامل ، کامل ، کامل ، ناگسست ، بی نظیر ، صدا و صدا "(ارهارد و
جنسن ، "قرار دادن یکپارچگی در امور مالی: یک رویکرد کاملاً مثبت" 6). این درک یکپارچگی با Phua ، ریشه کلمه هارمونیک است
Physis ، که طبق گفته هایدگر به معنای "آنچه در اصل و اصالت است
در حال حاضر این است: آنچه که اساساً بر خلاف زیرزمین وجود دارد
متناقض ها و ساختمانهای اجباری و اجباری "(IM 111). در متن
از جهت گیری اساسی آنها به وجود ، موجودات قبل از سونوگرافی دیده می شوند
در اصل درست است ، حقیقت ناشی از لحظه ظهور آزاد آنها. تحریفات
حقیقت آنها متعاقباً به عدم توافق آنها بود. این حس بودن به عنوان آنچه
ما ادعا می کنیم که یکی از آنها در اصل و معتبر است ، با Under-under
ایستادگی یکپارچگی ، و تمایز یکپارچگی یک عنصر اساسی از
دگرگونی که این انجمن در دسترس قرار می دهد. آرم: گردهمایی اولیه
در حال ظهور به حقیقت عدم تمایل ، Physis در آرم ها جمع می شود. مطابق
هایدگر ، دقیقاً همانطور که قدرت اصلی اصطلاح یونانی فیزیس از بین رفته است ، همینطور
معنی آرم ها با گذشت زمان اختصاص می یابد. برداشت دانشگاهی سنتی از
این اصطلاح این است که مربوط به گفتمان به نوعی است - به طور کلی دلیل ، ادعای یا
منطق به عنوان مثال ، در لفاظی ارسطو ، آرم ها آن دسته از شواهد را تعیین کردند
که در آن یک بلندگو از شواهدی که به توانایی مخاطب خاص در استدلال می پردازد ، استفاده می کند ،
استدلال برای آن مخاطب قانع کننده است. اما این تفسیرها بعداً مشتقات هستند ، زیرا معنای اساسی است
از این اصطلاح برای پیش سکوراتیک ها "هیچ ارتباطی فوری با زبان" نداشت (IM 137). در عوض ، آرم ها ، به عنوان Legein ، نوعی از فعل LEGO ، در ابتدا به معنای دراز کشیدن ، جمع آوری یا
جمع کردن Legein قرار است دراز بکشد ، قبل از آن دراز بکشد. آرم ها نشانگر اصل جمع آوری اولیه بودند. همانطور که موجودات از نوسان و جهان بیرون آمدند ، جنینی در معنی آنها
در حقیقت خود شکننده ، وظیفه ای که باید انجام شود ، حفظ آنها در آنها بود
عدم تمایل و در جهت گیری اساسی آنها به وجود: "انسان بودن" می نویسد
هایدگر ، "به معنای جمع آوری ، جمع آوری و دستگیری وجود موجودات" (IM 194). نامگذاری چیزی نیست که از وقوع ظهور پیروی کند. در عوض ، نامگذاری ،
گفته های اصلی ، اجازه می دهد تا "موجودات" در ساختار آن باز شود
جمع آوری ... انسانها ، به عنوان کسانی که در آرم ها ایستاده و در جمع عمل می کنند ، در جمع هستند
جمع کنندگان "(IM 191). چگونه می توانیم این ایده انسان را به عنوان جمع کننده فکر کنیم؟
بخوانید و گوش دهید ، ما نامه هایی را برای ساختن کلمات جمع می کنیم ، کلمات را جمع می کنیم تا جملات بسازند ، و
ایده ها را جمع کنید تا معنا پیدا کنید. همانطور که زندگی خود را طی می کنیم ، ساعت ها را جمع می کنیم تا
روز و به مرور زمان ، روزها و سالها و رویدادها را جمع می کنیم تا زندگی کنیم. در انجام این کار ،
ما این پدیده ها- وقایع زندگی ما را سفارش می دهیم- آنها را در زیر
ایستاده برای ایجاد روایات ، داستانهای پر از معنا ، که به ما کمک می کند تا به نظر برسند
خوب و درست بودن به همین ترتیب ، برای پیش از سکوراتیک ها ، جمع آوری آرم های آورده شده
دستور به صعود از نوسان: "بودن به عنوان آرم تجمع اصالت است ، نه یک پشته
یا یک شمع که در آن همه چیز به همان اندازه و به همان اندازه - و به همین دلیل حساب می شود ،
رتبه و تسلط متعلق به بودن "(IM 147). در آرم ها ، پدیده ها به عنوان آرایش شدند
دنیایی ، با اختلافات ، محدودیت ها و درجه های اهمیت. اما برای یونانیان ، یک عنصر در این گردهمایی وجود داشت که ما امروز داریم
درک دشواری: به عنوان "جمع آوری در اصل که دائماً جمع شده است
به خودی خود نوسان می کند ، "آرم ها" گردهمایی مداوم است ، جمع موجوداتی که
به خودی خود می ایستد ، یعنی بودن "(IM 141 ، 145 تأکید اضافه شده است) یونانی ها نبودند
صرفاً جمع کردن موجودات به جهان ، اما در تلاش بودند تا این کار را به گونه ای انجام دهند که
منشأ هر موجود را حفظ کرد: بودن ، نوسان ، پس زمینه ای که در آن بوده است
پنهان و از آن که در عدم وجود آن پدیدار شده بود. Legein برای یونانیان همانطور که در جهان بود به جهان جمع کرد
غیرقانونی فقط در این روش می توان آرم ها را به عنوان صحبت معتبر معتبر کرد. این است
اجازه دهید آنچه را که در منطقه آزاد عدم پذیرش آن غیرقانونی است ، رها کنید. و در
با تمایز این پدیده شکننده ، هایدگر (همانطور که اغلب او انجام می دهد) استفاده می کند-
گازی که شخصیت شاعرانه آن به شکنندگی آن احترام می گذارد:
374
وجود
گفته و صحبت از فانی ها از اوایل می گذرد
به عنوان Legein ، تخمگذار. گفتن و صحبت کردن اساساً به عنوان اتفاق می افتد
اجازه می دهد تا قبل از هر آنچه که در آن قرار داده شده است
عدم حضور ، به وجود می آید. (EGT 63)
حرف
[ بشر .] چنین اجازه می دهد هر چیزی را که پیش روی ماست ، تأسیس می کند
قبل از دروغ این خود را به عنوان خود تعیین می کند. ، یعنی یک اجازه اجازه قبل از
از آنچه در پیش روی ما قرار دارد ، در خودآمدی آن جمع شده است
دروغ پیش از این [. بشر .]. این تخمگذار استثنایی لژینی است که
می آید به عنوان آرم ها. (EGT 66)
حرف
این چالش برای اولین فیلسوفان بود: وجود داشته باشد - قلمرو
بی معنی و امکاناتی که معانی و امکانات از آن بوده است
ساخته شده- برای ایستادن در جهان: "فیزیک و آرم ها یکسان هستند.
با احترام جدید و در عین حال قدیمی: آنچه در حال موجود است ، می ایستد
مستقیم و برجسته به خودی خود ، به خودی خود و از خود جمع می شود و خودش را نگه می دارد
در چنین گردهمایی "(IM 145)."
376
وجود
هنگامی که شرکت کنندگان ساعت 1 بعد از ظهر از استراحت برگشتند ، وس و کیپ روی سکو بودند. وس (اشاره به یک زمین لرزه جزئی که در طول استراحت اتفاق افتاد)
آیا متوجه شدید که از خالی و بی معنی بودن ، زمین لرزه فقط یک زمین لرزه است؟ (برخی از شرکت کنندگان دست خود را بالا می برند)
خوب یک ثانیه صبر کنید. ما می خواهیم دعوت به شما را گسترش دهیم که وقتی می توانید منطقی باشد
از سکونت در خالی و بی معنی بیایید. ما شما را به یک کمپین دعوت می کنیم ، یک کمپین علیه
استدلال ما شما را به یک کمپین دعوت می کنیم تا منطقی در زندگی خود را از بین ببرید. (تشویق)
بنابراین ما یک سؤال برای شما داریم تا بتوانید با این کار انتخاب کنید
به نظر می رسد در زندگی شما. اکنون به دلایلی که برای شرکت در زندگی ندارید نگاه کنید. اینقدر
شما در جستجوی مناطقی از زندگی خود هستید که در آن مشارکت وجود نداشته است ، و در عوض
از مشارکت ، دلایلی برای عدم وجود وجود داشته است. شما در واقع باید شروع به طی کردن خود کنید
زندگی وقتی از جایی که اکنون در انجمن هستیم ، به دنبال آن هستید ، می توانید چیزهایی را که چنین نکرده اید ببینید
قبل از و شما در حال بررسی جایی هستید که می توانست مشارکت داشته باشد ، و وجود ندارد
و نیست و همه دلایلی برای عدم وجود وجود دارد. چه بازیهای جدیدی برای مشارکت وجود دارد؟ پرستون ، که در ابتدای جلسه دو روز سه در طول جلسه صحبت کرد ، ایستاد و یک میکرو گرفت
تلفن پیشوای
من قبل از رسیدن به اینجا می دانستم که اجازه ندارم یادداشت برداری کنم. کله
درست پیشوای
این مانند: من از تهدید بیشتری برای من نمی دانم. کله
یک تهدید عظیم پیشوای
من راکت خود را اجرا می کنم ، اما من آن را مانند یک کویوت از طریق جاده های پشتی اجرا می کنم. و من متوجه شدم
در روز اول که هیچ کس نگفت ، "هیچ یادداشتی" نیست. ما به وعده ها نرسیده ایم ، بنابراین ما بودیم
در سرزمین از پیش تولید شده ، و من یادداشت های خود را می نویسم. شما می دانید ، nugget به دنبال nugget ، که
من سرانجام می توانم بعداً بخوانم که مغز من حداقل برای این کار به من خدمت کند زیرا من به من اعتماد ندارم
مغز. بنابراین من ناگهان با این واقعیت روبرو شدم که من واقعاً قول نداده ام که این را حفظ خواهم کرد
وعده می دهد ، اما من تاکنون آنها را نگه داشته ام زیرا این کاری است که من تاکنون انجام می دهم. روز چهارم انجمن:
جلسه دو
روز چهارم: جلسه دو
377
کله
منظور شما این است که تاکنون یادداشت نمی کنید. پیشوای
من وقتی که نتوانستم تحمل کنم ، چند یادداشت در قلم روی مچ دست خود کردم. (خنده) r
کله
واقعاً؟ شما در مورد مچ دست خود یادداشت کردید؟ واقعاً؟ پیشوای
و سپس من به استراحت بیرون می روم و خیلی با دقت آن را می شستم. (خنده) r
کمی شبیه به سیگار کشیدن به عنوان یک کودک در حمام بود ، جایی که باید آن را پاک کنید
اسپری ، اما همه می دانند که وقتی گه می زنید نمی توانید چنین بوی شیرین ایجاد کنید. (خنده) r
اما من اینجا هستم تا وعده های خود را حفظ کنم و یادداشت برداری نکرده ام. و من می دانم که این همان چیزی است که
من تا به حال در زندگی ام در حال دویدن بوده ام. یکی از عناصر ساختار در اینجا نحوه من است
با یادداشت برداری ، کاملاً زنده مانده است: من نوت بوک دارم. من در نوت بوک های خود کتاب های مرجع دارم ، اما
من احتمالاً نمی توانم آنها را از بین ببرم زیرا آنها را به درستی برچسب گذاری نکرده ام. بنابراین من در گذرگاه متوجه شدم
فکر کردم که من همه این یادداشت ها را نگه داشته ام اما نمی توانم به خوبی به هیچ یک از آنها دسترسی پیدا کنم. این داستان نیست ،
این یک واقعیت است بنابراین من آنچه را که من را از جو دوسر نگه داشته است ، تسلیم کرده ام. و تا دیروز حاضر شدم این کار را انجام دهم. من فقط یک یادداشت درست کرده ام ، فقط سه کلمه ، که من قبل از دیدن آن شسته ام. (خنده) r
و از آنچه ورنر امروز صبح گفت ، این عذرخواهی من است. بنابراین من به آنچه که من نگاه کرده ام
نتوانسته ام خودم را نگه دارم ، اکنون که من هیچ یادداشت نکرده ام ، و احساس می کنم
چیز این است - قطعه ای وجود دارد که هنوز هم مانند بسیاری دیگر در اینجا برای من جمع نشده است. من توانستم به این دلیل که در مورد آن یادداشت نمی کشم ، روی قطعه قطعه قطعه شود. و قطعه
"جعبه ها" بود ، و من یکی از افرادی که پس از آخرین جلسه به من گفتند به من کمک کردم ،
"ساختار حامی عالی وعده ها است." وقتی ساختار دارید ، به شما کمک می کند تا در آن بمانید
هدف با قول خود من شروع کردم به دیدن اینکه جعبه ها جایی هستند که شما از ساختار استفاده می کنید ، کجا
من ساختار را اعمال می کنم. بیرون رفتم و نگاهی به زندگی ام انداختم و به ترک های روسازی نگاه کردم ،
از آنجا که این راه من است ، و من یک نشانه را بر روی یک پارکینگ دیدم که می گفت "اعتبارسنجی". چشمک می زند
دو بار و بعد سیاه می رود. من نمی دانم انرژی این اتاق تا چه حد گسترش می یابد؟ (خنده) r
فهمیدم که موضع من در پوچی و عدم وجود معنا قوی تر است. من قوی تر
در آن مکان بایستید ، هرچه بیشتر بتوانم از ساختار استفاده کنم. سه سطح حقیقت
هدف مارتین هایدگر به عنوان یک فیلسوف این بود که حقیقت را به وجود آورد
حضور در تجربه انسانی. این مسئله از این طریق متفاوت است
تصور کنید که چه چیزی به نظر می رسد ، یا چه چیزی ممکن است ایجاد کند
SIBLE ، از آنجا که بیشتر قسمت ها برای ما گم شده است. و وقتی
نشان داده شده است ، مدت طولانی گیر نکرده است. چرا؟ 378
وجود
کله
هرچه بیشتر از زندگی خالی و بی معنی باشید. پیشوای
بله این یک پارادوکس است. تمام کاری که شما می توانید انجام دهید این است که آنچه ورنر به نظر می رسد انجام دهد ، این است که فقط آن را تکرار کنید و
بارها و بارها و سه نفر بلند می شوند و او بارها و بارها آن را تکرار می کند. من راه می روم-
در کنار هم و این اتفاق می افتد: "اعتبارسنجی". و من می بینم که در آن چیزی برای من وجود دارد
فضایی که اکنون سعی می کنم در آن بایستم ، که به من دستور داده شده است که در آن بایستم ، به جای انجام یک
ورزش و آنچه در آن هستم چیزی در اصطلاحات خودم است ، زیرا من عاشق زبان هستم
تمایز - این جایی است که من با مسیر ورنر فروتنانه عبور می کنم: این هنر رزمی من ، عمل من است. و فهمیدم که چیزی در آن پوچی وجود دارد که به نوعی آن را ترک نمی کند
و شاید بتواند در کنار من بماند و به من کمک کند تا به آن قسمت از خودم برگردم - این است
آنچه من اعتماد و بی گناهی می نامم ، و منظور من از بی گناهی برای خودم ساده لوح نیست ،
این فقط آمادگی است - از وضعیت آمادگی - اعتماد به نفس من دیروز نیز به آن رسیدم. بنابراین به نوعی من
با داشتن ساختار ، با داشتن ساختار ، چند اینچ را به زیر پاهای من کشید
بوکس ، با بوکس کردن خودم. و این برای من اتفاق افتاد - از آنجا که این چیزی نیست که چنین نبوده است
در صحبت های زیادی مطرح کرد- شاید این به دلیل فشار زمان و پیش از این چیزی بود
Sures و آنچه در جریان می توانست به مناسبت دیگری ، در قالب دیگری ، کمی بیشتر داشته باشد
زمان آن و من فکر کردم که اگر این چیزی بود که برای من گم شده بود و من می توانم آن را وارد کنم ، پس من
می تواند حدس بزند که ورنر در آینده چه کاری انجام خواهد داد. کله
خطر مکالمه ، پرستون - من نمی گویم مکالمه راه خطرناک است
شما آن را می گویید ، اما خطر این است که شما آن را به یک جواب تبدیل کنید. پیشوای
من می گویم این فقط یک فکر بود. این همان چیزی بود که در ذهنم اتفاق افتاد که من در حال تماشای "Vali- بود
دوستیابی "علامت. من هیچ یک از این موارد را شخصاً نمی گیرم. KIPP
یا مثل جواب پیشوای
نه ، این دقیقاً همان چیزی است که من به جای اینکه فکر می کنم انجام می دهم ، فکر می کنم. کله
خیلی خوب خوب پیشوای
و آخرین فکر در مورد این آنچه برای من اتفاق افتاده است مجموعه ای از تمایزات بود. من ساخته بودم
انتخاب بعد از انتخاب بعد از انتخاب ، بنابراین به نظر می رسد مکانی که من در انجمن خود در آن قرار دارم ، انتخاب شده است. حتی یک جواب را انتخاب نکنید ... هایدگر می گوید که به عنوان Augenblick ، ​​A به وجود می آید
لحظه دید-سوئیچ ژستالت همه در یک باره که در آن جهش می کنیم
ناگهان روی زمین جدید ، جایی که همه چیز متفاوت است. اما
هدیه موجود با شرایط غیر قابل مذاکره همراه است. اول ، جهش
نمی توان انجام شد مگر اینکه زمان و مکان مناسب باشد
برای اجرای لازم ایجاد شده اند. دوم ، زمین جدید خواهد بود
به عنوان زمین قدیمی ، زمین آشنایی که در آن ما آشکار می شود ، آشکار می شود
همه در کنار هم ایستاده اند ، اما در یک
نور جدید جدید. سوم ، در این نور جدید ، زمین جامد نیست
به روشی که ما همیشه روی زمین حساب کرده ایم. از این رو
ما باید خودمان را به سطح جدیدی از عدم اطمینان باز کنیم ، که این نیز
به معنای سطح جدیدی از آزادی هستی شناختی است. عمل اجرا-
بالا همیشه باز کردن زمین قدیمی است ، به طوری که یک پس زمینه
می توان فاش کرد برای هایدگر پس از آن ، و به همین ترتیب برای ورنر ارهارد ، ترانس
وجود انسان تشکیل شده در حال حاضر است ؛ آزادی آن همیشه در حال حاضر
در دسترس ما بوده است اما ما به ندرت قدرت آن را تجربه می کنیم زیرا ما
آن را اختصاص نداده ایم - یعنی ما به طور واقعی قبول نکرده ایم
و مالکیت وجود ما را گرفت. "بودن" یک مفهوم فازی است
ما این یک قلمرو مشخص نیست. بنابراین اجرای آن به صورت تدریجی اتفاق می افتد
فرآیندی که در آن زمین قدیمی را متمایز می کنیم- موجود ما-
در جهان-به خودی خود ، تا بتوانیم آن را برای آنچه در آن است مالکیت کنیم. این است
اولین قدم اساسی برای دستیابی به تحول و روند
سه روز اول انجمن را اشغال می کند. یک تمایز اساسی در این فرایند تمایز است
خود تمایز.
پاکسازی aletheia
یکی از اصطلاحاتی که هایدگر آنتولوگ را متمایز کرد-
ابعاد ICAL کلمه یونانی Aletheia یا عدم وجود است. این کلمه ، برای هایدگر و برای پیش از سکوراتیک ها ، می گوید رایگان
باز بودن در ابتدا موجودات آشکار می شوند. این اصطلاح اغلب
به عنوان یک حقیقت درک شده است. اما این اشتباه نیست-
به عنوان "حقیقت" درک روزمره فعلی ما ، به عنوان
مکاتبات یک ادعا با شیء آن ؛ این نوع حقیقت
در بهترین حالت سایه ای از این کلمه یونانی باستانی است. روز چهارم: جلسه دو

کله
بله پیشوای
اما با آن بودن به گونه ای که بتوانم از جعبه ای که می گویم انتخاب کنم. کله
وقتی به این گفتگو در مورد انتخاب ، با انتخاب ، رسیدیم ، به آن یکی باز خواهیم گشت. خوب چیزی بیشتر برای شما ، پرستون؟ پیشوای
شماره کیپ
ممنون (تشویق)
کله
بنابراین ، ما از شما می خواهیم که به کجا در زندگی خود توجه کنید دلایلی برای شرکت در آن داشته اید ،
این سوال در دست است. و ما این تمایز را به نام استدلال متمایز می کنیم. باری
این برای من کاملاً منطقی بوده است که خودم را از مردم متمایز نگه دارم. جدا ، مشخص نیست. کله
بله ، جدا باری
احساس محافظت از خودم وجود دارد. احساس می کنم نمی خواهم مکیده شوم
به چیزهایی که نمی خواهم وارد آن شوم. من بازی را انتخاب می کنم ؛ من روشی را که پخش می شود انتخاب می کنم. کله
به هر حال ، شما آن را انتخاب نمی کنید. باری
من تصمیم می گیرم چه بازی ای را انجام دهم ... KIPP
شما از شواهدی که توسط راکت خود به شما داده می شود استفاده می کنید ، و آن شواهد را بررسی می کنید.
محصول این شواهد انجام داده است که انجام می دهید. و محصول این شواهد "بسیاری است
دلایل. "
وقتی در لحظه ای از آن در آنجا هستیم
در حال ظهور ، قبل از ادعاها - که شروع به دستیابی به آنچه می شود شروع می شود
توسط Aletheia: یک روش رایگان برای مواجهه با موجوداتی که به آنها امکان می دهد
چیزهایی هستند که هستند. با این حال ، به گفته توماس شین ، در ساخت کتاب خود
حس هایدگر ، نه فقط دو ، بلکه سه روش وجود دارد
هایدگر با Aletheia رفتار می کند ، که در تجزیه و تحلیل از آن مفید خواهد بود
روش انجمن ما همانطور که انجام داده ایم به خواننده یادآوری می کنیم
در طول این کتاب ، که ما در مورد قلمرو صحبت می کنیم
بدون سطح وقتی در مورد قلمرو هستی صحبت می کنیم ، ورنر ارهارد
گفته است ، تنها کاری که می توانیم انجام دهیم دروغ است ("تنها کاری که می توانم انجام دهم دروغ است."). اما اینطور نیست
یعنی ما باید از صحبت کردن دست برداریم و توماس شهان باز شده است
برخی از امکانات جالب برای تفکر. شین این پیشنهاد را پیشنهاد می کند
ممکن است Aletheia به عنوان سه سطح تصور شود - یعنی این
سه روش برای فهمیدن هایدگر وجود دارد
هنگام برخورد با "حقیقت":
Aletheia 1 ، Aletheia 2 ، and Aletheia 3. Aletheia 3 به صحت بیانیه اشاره دارد -
مکاتبات گزاره ای با وضعیت Aff که به آن
اشاره دارد این تعریف بسیاری از جنبه های ارزیابی را برانگیخته و
قضاوت ، البته ، اما این همان چیزی است که ما به طور کلی وقتی منظور ما است
در مکالمات روزمره ما از کلمه "حقیقت" استفاده کنید. Aletheia 3
همچنین نشان می دهد سطح متوسط ​​حقیقت که در روزمره انتظار داریم
مقابله در جهان ، و این نوع حقیقت است که در درون آن عمل می کند
"داستانهای" ما.
Aletheia 2 حضور معنادار از پیش از پیشرو است
چیزهایی در جهان ، قلمرو معنای غیر قابل اجتناب است که در آن
ما زندگی خود را زندگی می کنیم. برای انسان ، همه چیز به معنای چیزی است ،
یعنی می توان به عنوان چیزی درک کرد. Aletheia 2 نوع است
حقیقت که وقتی شرکت کنندگان "آنچه را" متمایز می کند پدیدار می شود
Pened "همانطور که از داستان آنها در مورد آنچه اتفاق افتاده متمایز است. Aletheia 1 باز بودن وجودی ، قلمرو ناگفته است
بی معنی این زمینه برای دو قلمرو دیگر است ، و
شیهان این زمینه را "حضور بی نظیر از حضور" می نامد
پاکسازی باز شده "(توماس شهان ، حس هایدگ-
Ger 75). این زمینه بی اساس بشریت ما ، هدیه بودن است:
حرف
هیچ چیز 380
وجود
باری
بارهای آنها کله
بله باری
و من دیروز در روند خطر که از آن گرفتم ، که تجربه من از آن بود ، متوجه شدم.
آنچه من ایجاد کردم این بود که تجربه من کم عمق بود ، که من کم عمق بودم ، حالات عاطفی من در
هر دو جهت بودند. و ... کیپ
شما مشارکت زیادی برای خود ندارید؟ باری
بله ، من ذاتاً آن را محدود می کنم. و ایده ترور ، اگرچه من می دانم که این درست است ، من حتی یک
تجربه مستقیم از آن ، بنابراین من تجربه نداشتن تجربه ای از آن را تجربه کردم. کله
به جای دلیل عدم داشتن آن ... باری
خوب ، تا آن نقطه ، بله. و حتی در آن نقطه من گفتم: "خوب ، این یک دلیل است. و این من هستم ،
و این اکنون است ، و من اینجا هستم ، و بگذارید این برای اولین بار باشد. " و بخش بزرگی از داستان
راکت این بود که من فقط احساسات عمیقی احساس نمی کنم. کله
بله ، "شما من را می شناسید. من آنها را احساس نمی کنم. برخی از افراد ، برخی از مردم این کار را نمی کنند. "
باری
و من آن را دوست ندارم اما از داشتن آنها امن تر است. بنابراین من به "خوب این جایی است که من هستم." وت
نوعی پخته شده در آن و متوجه شد که برای من افکار من مانند یکی از آن نشانه هایی است که
در حالی که در خط دلی ایستاده اید ، این خبر را به شما می دهد ، این باعث می شود وقتی شما سرگیجه می کنید
خیلی طولانی تماشا کن کله
به هر حال این محدود به شما نیست. باری
و من متوجه شدم که واقعاً هیچ مشکلی وجود ندارد که آنها همانطور که انجام می دادند ، و نه
با استفاده از کنسرو قابل توجه به هر یک از این افکار و اجازه دادن به آنها در آنجا ، من فقط متوجه شدم
روش تحقیق Erhard ، یک عمل بازگشتی استراتژیک
در هر مکالمه با هر یک از شرکت کنندگان تکرار شده ، فاش می کند
بودن انسان فراتر از سطح گزاره روزمره
(Aletheia 3
(
). به منظور تحقق این امر ، سطح "حقیقت" خوانده می شود
Aletheia 3 ابتدا باید به عنوان خود متمایز شود-
ج
درک متعهد از جهان: توجیهات ، دلایل ،
توضیحات ، و نسخه های مربوط به شرایط
زندگی و استراتژی های تصویب شده برای مقابله با آن شرایط-
ES ، آنچه در این انجمن به عنوان داستان شخص متمایز است. این به این است
سطح حقیقت که ارهارد وقتی اعلام می کند که این کار را نمی کند ، اشاره می کند
حقیقت را بدانید ، همانطور که هر جمله ای که به عنوان ادعای مورد استفاده قرار گرفته است
به نوعی سفارش در حال حاضر هیچ یک از ارزش حقیقت خود را از دست داده است. در روند تمایز Aletheia 3 به عنوان Aletheia 3 ، به عنوان داستان ،
پیش زمینه بیشتر به عنوان پس زمینه از
که Aletheia 3 فاش شده است. این پیشینه دیگر Aletheia است
2 ، که در مکالمه انجمن اتفاقاتی است که اتفاق افتاده است. همانطور که دودی از داستانهای متبلور ما از بین می رود ، آلتیا
2 از "حقیقت" آلتیا 3 ، سطح متمایز می شود
حقیقت که در آن "چه اتفاقی افتاده" تاکنون برگزار شده است. چه
قبلاً "حقیقت" به عنوان یک تفسیر فاش می شد
به همین ترتیب فراموش شده ، تعبیری که هرگز نمی تواند به "چه چیزی" برسد
اتفاق افتاد. " در این سطح جدید از حقیقت ، آنچه اتفاق افتاده است
د
همانطور که اتفاق افتاده است ، و اکنون بی صدا ، به اصطلاح ، باز شد.
از معنای باریک ، داستان آن را در درون قاب کرده بود. در نتیجه
هر اتفاقی که افتاده است باز می شود تا بسیاری از راهها به دست بیاید.
می توان دید که راه های زیادی برای ساختن وجود دارد
"چه اتفاقی افتاد" معنی دار ، و برای دیدن اینکه ما هرگز قادر نخواهیم بود
برای گفتن یک حقیقت واحد در مورد آنچه اتفاق افتاده است. آنچه باعث متمایز کردن Aletheia 3 و Aletheia 2 می شود
پیشینه قلمرو ناگفته هستی ، Aletheia 1 ،
پیشینه بی معنی ، از هیچ چیز ، که در آن دنیای ما
معنی بوجود می آید یعنی اقدامات تکراری در تمایز در
زبان "داستان" و "آنچه اتفاق افتاده" از قبل و همیشه بیرون می آید
"زندگی خالی و بی معنی است و خالی و بی معنی است
که زندگی خالی و بی معنی است "به عنوان زمینه پس زمینه ، یا
پاکسازی برای حضور معنی دار. ما نمی توانیم ماهیت a را درک کنیم
روز چهارم: جلسه دو
381
بدون گفتن چیزی ، یا مستقیماً در مورد آن ، که من با افرادی که بودند احساس صمیمی تر کردم
به اشتراک گذاشتن در گروه و آن احساسات درست از من شروع می شود. و من می دانم من
می تواند آن را بگیرد و منطقی باشد و بگوید "اوه ، عالی است ، من این کار را همیشه انجام خواهم داد و خواهم کرد
این احساسات را داشته باشید و همه چیز از بین خواهد رفت. " و سلام ، من آن را احساس می کنم.
وقتی این کار را می کنی باری
من الان هستم ممکن است امشب نباشم یا ممکن است فردا نباشم. حالا من هستم کله
شما همیشه وقتی این کار را می کنید. باری
من آنجا هستم کله
خیلی ممنون (تشویق)
بنابراین ، ما این تمایز را به نام استدلال متمایز می کنیم. آیا به این ترتیب است که در زندگی شما هم
آیا نتایج یا دلایل عدم داشتن آنها وجود دارد؟ و آیا این به گونه ای است که به عنوان یک انسان ،
راه این است که یک انسان باشید ، این است که اگر به خودتان دلیل کافی می دهید که هم برابر می شوید
وزن آن؟ این دلیل کافی برای نداشتن این نتیجه است. بنابراین اگر نتیجه رخ ندهد ،
بلافاصله به کجا نگاه می کنید؟ به همین دلیل این کار را نکرد. بنابراین ما می پرسیم که در کجا در زندگی شما است
آیا دلایلی برای عدم شرکت در آن دارید؟ لطفا ... سانفورد
خوب ، اشتراک یکی از آنهاست. برای اولین روز و نیم در اینجا من روی سهام زیادی نشسته بودم ،
من دلایل زیادی داشتم ، می دانید ، سهم طلایی ، کل بیت. بنابراین اکنون من دلایلی برای
به اشتراک گذاری ، بنابراین واقعاً هیچ راهی برای دور شدن از هر یک از آنها وجود ندارد. اما فراتر از آن ، من داشته ام
دلایل عدم انتخاب شغل ، به دلیل عدم زندگی در امکان کامل زندگی برای زندگی
من دلایل عدم حفظ وعده ها - برخی از وعده ها را به مردم در سیاتل در مورد آن داده اید
در ارتباط با افراد در انجمن در مورد چیزهای مختلف در اطراف کار ، و
فقط در همه جا ، هرجایی که نگاه می کنم. دلایلی برای انجام کارها و عدم انجام آن وجود دارد. وقتی من
نتایج تولید می کنم دلایل دریافت نتایج را دارم. اگر نتیجه ای کسب نکنم دلایل آن را دارم
نکردن آنها ، اما اگر نتیجه بگیرم دلایلی برای گرفتن آنها دارم. کله
خوب چیز دیگری؟ حقیقت به جز از منظر فراتر از آن حقیقت ، و آن دیدگاه
Tive باید برای خود ایجاد و کشف شود زیرا یکی در درون زندگی می کند
گفتگوی بلاغی انجمن به عنوان آشکار می شود. شرکت کنندگان در
مجمع ، بارها و بارها فراخوانده می شود تا در دیدگاه دیگری بایستد
با یک سطح از حقیقت کاملاً متفاوت از سطح از سطح
با این حال ، که زندگی معمولاً به طور معمول درک می شود - به عنوان داستان.
وقتی کسی صحبت می کند ، پاکسازی ابتدایی را که ما هستیم نامگذاری می کند
هستند ، فقط می توان در سطح "شما آنچه را انجام می دهید و خود را انجام دهید
کاری را که نمی کنید انجام ندهید. " ادامه ایجاد و گسترش
از این دیدگاه - عدم وجود - کار ورنر است
erhard از آغاز آموزش EST. حرف
اما چگونه این عدم توافق در انجمن اتفاق می افتد؟ ما به محیط اصالت که دارد توجه می کنیم
طی سه روز گذشته در اتاق انجمن ایجاد شده است - اول ،
از طریق افشای عدم اطمینان اساسی انسان
موجودات از طریق اقدامات گفتمانی متمایز داستان و
چه اتفاقی افتاد ، راکت و غیره ؛ دوم ، از طریق افشای
اشتراک به عنوان یک روش خاص برای برقراری ارتباط ؛ و سوم ، از طریق
اشتراک معتبر خود که در شرکت کنندگان پدید آمده است
تعامل با Erhard و سایر رهبران انجمن. در این محیط ، سطح جدیدی از عدم پذیرش می شود
با شروع داستان به عنوان داستان- حتی توسط افراد
Viduals که به آنها می گویند ، کسانی که زندگی آنها شکل گرفته و محدود بوده است
این "حقیقت" داستانهای آنها است. بیش از حد عصبانی و ترس از فاش کردن
این ، مارشا فریب داشتن همه اینها را حفظ کرده بود ،
که شروع به "نازک شدن او" کرد. فرشته به عنوان یک کودک تصمیم گرفت که او
دلسوزترین فرد جهان به عنوان راهی برای بیش از حد
ترس او از اینکه اصلاً مراقبت نکند. مایک احمق شد و در
نیاز به کمک دیگران به عنوان پاسخ به تجربه خود به عنوان
بی عرضه؛ جین پنهان می شود تا از تجربه خجالت جلوگیری کند-
به دلیل بی ارزش بودن. اینها افشای است ،
دهانه ها فقط از دیدگاه ممکن است از کدام داستان و
اتفاقی که افتاد متمایز و غیرقابل حل است. بنابراین ، به عنوان شکل گیری
قدرت داستانها شروع می شود ، حضور زیر
شرایط با وضوح جدید پدیدار می شود. همزمان ، الف
آزادی جدید ظاهر می شود. 382
وجود
در سنفورد
بله سوال دلایل عدم مشارکت بود. دلایل زیادی برای شرکت نکردن دارم
در برنامه کمک کننده کله
همه می دانند که او به افرادی که میکروفن و انسان در حال اجرا هستند مراجعه می کند-
پیر شدن این کل برنامه؟ اینها دستیاران یک برنامه هستند. شما فرصتی خواهید داشت
بعداً آنها را تصدیق کنید. ممنون برو جلو در سنفورد
بنابراین ، من مطمئن نیستم که ارزش زیادی در این دلایل وجود دارد ، اما هزینه داشتن
این دلایل به جای کمک کردن این است که ، شماره یک ، من هر چیزی را در دسترس ندارم
از کمک من برای من آنجا خواهد بود و من همه افراد را از آنچه می توانم دور می کنم
با انجام این کار مشارکت کنید. کله
بله آنچه به دست آورده اید دلایل شماست. در سنفورد
بله و اگر من به این موضوع بپردازم ، در پایان زندگی من این چیزی است که من خواهم داشت
دلایل کاری که من انجام دادم و کاری که به جای نتایج قدرتمند انجام ندادم. کله
و این همان چیزی است که بیشتر مردم به دست آوردند. در سنفورد
بله احتمالاً آنچه همه به دست آورده اند ؛ احتمالاً آنچه همه به دست آورده اند. کله
بله ، خوب ، شما با بسیاری از افراد صحبت می کنید و تقریباً این همان چیزی است که مردم در مورد آنها می گویند
زندگی: "اگر ..."
ج
در سنفورد
بله ، این داستان من مطمئناً است. کله
سانفورد ، متشکرم آناب؟ (تشویق)
آناب
دلایل عدم مشارکت به مسیری طولانی برمی گردد. بنابراین اکنون می توانم آن را ببینم. زودتر وقتی ورنر
هر زمان که اتفاق افتاد ، و واکنش من در مورد وقتی شش ساله بودیم یا چهار یا چهار نفر صحبت می کردیم
افتضاح
با این وجود ، داستان ها قدرت دارند. معناداری اینها
تفسیرها درک عملی را ارائه داده است
ما با شرایط زندگی خود مقابله کرده ایم. همانطور که Erhard بیان می کند
آن در جلسه سه روز چهارم ، اقدامات ما همیشه در یک رقص است
با نحوه وقوع جهان. اما در حالی که ما غوطه ور هستیم
فراموشی Aletheia 3 ، رقص غیر معتبر است. ما مالک نیستیم
واقعیتی که ما زندگی می کنیم زیرا ما آن را انتخاب نکرده ایم. و نه
ما انتخاب کردیم که آن را انتخاب نکنیم. ما فقط در رانش افتاده ایم
حرف
از رقصی که برای ما باز شده است. و به جای
با اوضاع مقابله می کنیم ، ما به حواس پرتی های آرام می پردازیم
از "آنها".
فراموشی اجتناب ناپذیر خود "آنها"- فراموشی
وجود این که پیروی از عدم تحقق داستان شخص به عنوان یک است
داستان - همان چیزی است که هایدگر آن را "سقوط" خوانده است. توماس شیهان
در ایجاد حس هایدگر می نویسد که سقوط نوعی است
حرف
فراموش کردن این نتیجه از تمرکز روی آنچه برای آن معنی دارد
ایالات متحده: "هرچه بیشتر روی معنی دار تمرکز کنم ، بیشتر فراموش می کنم
پاکسازی پرتاب شده است که به معنای امکان پذیر است و
لازم است "(116): ما Aletheia 1 و Aletheia 2 را فراموش می کنیم و انحراف می کنیم
به ترتیب حقیقت داده شده توسط Fallenness ، یعنی توسط Aletheia 3. گفتگوی این انجمن به منظور ایجاد مؤلفه طراحی شده است
شلوار به هیچ چیز ، پاکسازی باز شده Aletheia 1 ، که است
فقط از طریق تجربه گفتگو ممکن است
برای خود همانطور که به عقب از حقیقت به عنوان Aletheia 3 به عقب حرکت می کند
Aletheia 2 ، که در حال حاضر به حضور Aletheia 1. دوباره و
دوباره و دوباره به عنوان مثال ، در طول مکالمه خود با جودی در حین ses-
Sion دو روز دو ، Erhard جودی و همه شرکت کنندگان را آورد
فکر کردن و
k
این سه سطح را برای خود تجربه می کنند. به جودی
شناخت داستان او به عنوان یک داستان - که پسران او را دوست نداشتند
او یک دختر کوچک بود - اررد گفت: "یک داستان فقط یک داستان است"
نمای Aletheia 3 فقط هنگام "ایستادن" یا "آمدن" به ما اعطا کرد
از "Aletheia 2. وقتی ارهارد همچنان می گوید" چه
اتفاق افتاده است "آنچه درست است یا نه. این کار را کرد یا این کار را نکرد ، "او صحبت می کند
از دیدگاه پاکسازی باز شده توسط Ale-
Theia 1 با توجه به Aletheia 2 و Aletheia 3. Erhard ادامه داد:
