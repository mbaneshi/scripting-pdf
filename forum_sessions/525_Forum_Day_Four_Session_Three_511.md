Forum Day Four: Session Three 511
HENRY
My promise is that the twenty-fi ve year racket that I’ve lived—I’m giving that up and am now
living out the distinction ecological health. I appreciate you very much, and I love you all.
ERHARD
Okay good. Thank you.
ZELDA
What do you mean: to stand for?
ERHARD
Declare the possibility of...; live out of the possibility of...; have as the context for living, the
possibility of...; Generate a conversation for...; create a context for...
ZELDA
I understand that. It says to me to be generous.
ERHARD
I’m not asking you to be generous. You will be generous if you do that. I’m not asking you to be
generous, because that would mean for you to have a quality inside yourself called generous.
If you act on the off er to have anything out of The Forum you are willing to stand for having
gotten... if you act on the off er you will be being generous. Generosity arises in an act of being.
It’s not a property inside of people that gets expressed in their actions. You get that?
ZELDA
Yes. Thank you.
(applause)
WALT
I say I’m not confused about what you’ve given us in the last hour, but it is a lot to hold.
ERHARD
Yes, precisely, so listen up here. This is good. I read something to you three days ago and I want
you to hear it again. See if it occurs for you diff erently than it did then.
Here, he read again the passage from the Heidegger/Japanese dialogue in Heidegger’s On the Way to
Language.
ERHARD (reading)
“We Japanese do not think it strange if a dialogue leaves undefi ned what is really intended, or
even restores it back to the keeping of the undefi nable.” ... “That is part of every dialogue that
has turned out well among thinking beings. As if of its own accord it can take care that that
undefi nable something not only does not slip away, but displays its gathering power ever more
Stanley Kubrick’s film 2001, when he asked whether he is happy:
“I’m using all my capacities to the maximum. What more could a
rational entity want?” This, says Dreyfus, is “a brilliant expression
of what anyone would say who is in touch with our current
understanding of Being.”
Of particular relevance is Dreyfus’ observation that “the
human potential movement perfectly expresses this technological
understanding of Being” (“Gaining”). Werner Erhard’s work, which
Peter Marin has called “the logical extension of the whole human
potential movement” (“The New Narcissism,” Harper’s Magazine,
October 1975, 47), may therefore be considered as a representative
manifestation of our current technological understanding of
Being, especially to the degree that this logical extension is
itself, paradoxically, a denial of the so-called human potential
movement. This point is central to the conclusion we are moving
toward here.
The situation: humans are always subjected to understandings
of Being, and to the way they play themselves out over time. In
Dreyfus’ words, “We don’t produce the clearing; The clearing
produces us” (“Gaining”). Every historical epoch is characterized
by a particular mode of unconcealment, a particular way in which
Being shows itself, so that in each epoch humans are given a
particular way to be. Through this epochal self-revealing, this
giving of itself to humans, Being manifests its nature; and beings
show up being that way, “the way they wound up being,” as Erhard
might say more recently.
But as Western thought has evolved over time, human beings
have lost their awareness of Being, if ever they have even been
aware of Being. Now, of the giver-giving-given event that is Being’s
gift , we see only the given, and we see it only as it is represented by
beings. Being “withdraws in favor of the gift  which It gives” (OTB 8).
When a giver withdraws and holds itself back, and gives only
its gift , that giving is appropriately called sending (OTB 8). The
gift  is given, but the sender, crucially, is not present. So while an
experience of Being is no longer available, the sending continues
to shape human existence in every age. This is the process which
Heidegger calls the destining of Being, and from this destining

luminously in the course of the dialogue.” The Japanese inquirer said “Our dialogues with our
teacher failed to turn out so well. Us younger men challenged him much too directly to satisfy
our thirst for handy information.” ... “Thirst for knowledge and greed for explanations never
lead to a thinking inquiry. Curiosity is always the concealed arrogance of a self-consciousness
that banks on a self-invented rationality.”
(to the group)
You remember I told you that that means we treat anything worth knowing as something
that merely extends from what we already know and that if we don’t immediately understand
something it must be bullshit.
(continuing to read)
“The will to know does not will to abide in hope before what is worthy of thought.”
(to the group)
What you and I just spoke about in the last two hours is worth standing in front of. You may not
get it all, which means you may not understand it all, which really means you may not be able
to apply it all, and your applying it will only denigrate it anyhow. Much better to stand with it,
to be with it.
WALT
So I’m way beyond what I understood before. I’m standing on a beach ball here, ready to lose
my balance. But it’s a good place to be. I understood you to tell us that the forwarding of this is
in declaration, that declaration is the way to access this?
ERHARD
Declaration is the action out of which possibility is generated: the speech act out of which
possibility is generated; it’s the name of the speech act out of which possibility arises.
WALT
So that’s what a person can do, in doing, to work with this.
ERHARD
Yeah, to generate a possibility. Precisely.
WALT
But the possibility, this possibility that’s created, is itself not useful, or applicable, but it sounds
“opportunity” somehow gets created.
ERHARD
There’s an opening. A freedom. There’s a freedom for that which you have declared possible. It
doesn’t mean you will—it means that there’s a freedom for that which you’ve declared possible,
that your actions may arise inside that possibility, and that your actions will arise inside that
possibility. We’re not done yet. We’ve got one last step to take.
“the essence of all history is determined” (“QCT” in BW 329). Here
Dreyfus recounts the historical record:
In the Christian age, everything showed up as
God’s creation, and showed up in terms of its
nearness or distance from God’s own nature.
In the modern age, everything showed up as
either a subject with a deep essence, or an ob-
ject with fixed properties. In the technological
age, by contrast, everything shows up in light
of what will allow us to put it to “the greatest
possible use at the lowest expenditure.” (Com-
panion to Heidegger 13)
“
Heidegger refers to this historical evolution of destining as the
play of Being. Being holds itself back in a particular way in each
epoch, and it is in the progress of the epochs that the play of Being
is manifested. The order of that play defies human understanding
and control: “The sequence of epochs in the destiny of Being is not
accidental, nor can it be calculated as necessary” (OTB 9). It plays.
Therefore enframing can be seen from one perspective as the
essence of modern technology, while from another it is simply the
particular clearing for unconcealment which the play of Being has
sent at this moment in history.
At this point, the reader may notice herself thinking some
version of “So what?” Yes, we can see the eff ects of technology
in our world. We overuse our gadgets and texting while driving is
dangerous and our interpersonal eye contact is suff ering.
But at the same time global communication and the conveniences
of everyday living have improved exponentially, and marginalized
groups around the globe have found a voice through social media
that have also shaken the foundations of local, national, and world
politics. Every advance brings its challenges. We can deal with it.
Perhaps. Certainly, the advantages are undeniable. But the
threat embedded in technology’s essence may make this one
advance too far. With each development in the play of Being, we
are moving farther and farther from the possibility of an originary
experience of Being: “The epochs overlap each other in their
