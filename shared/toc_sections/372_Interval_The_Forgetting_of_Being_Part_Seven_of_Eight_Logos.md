ERHARD
What it means is, “Then fuck it!” So you’ve got to get, not only that it’s empty and meaningless,
but also that it’s empty and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless.
SALLY
Well, I want to do something with it...
ERHARD
I understand.
SALLY
But there’s nothing to do.
ERHARD
That’s right. There’s nothing to do. Anything you do ruins it. You want to make a prescription
out of it, Sally. You want it to tell you what to do. And like I said yesterday, the truth never
gives any prescription. And if you get any prescription out of the truth, you suck the truth value
out of it. It becomes devoid of any truth value. All you can do with this is get it. It’s not worth
anything; it’s worth nothing; it’s worthless: Because you can’t use it. It doesn’t help you to win;
it doesn’t help you to avoid losing; it doesn’t help you to be right... see, if only it would tell you
what to do with your life, then you would be happy. See, you would all be happy if we put on a
presentation here, skillfully enough so that you actually believed that you knew what you were
supposed to do with your life. So listen up. If we had a real scam ... and Wes and Kipp and I are
smart enough to put one together—make a note—it’s maybe worth doing.
(laughter)
But I want you to listen. What would people say if you did The Forum and it left you knowing
clearly what you were supposed to do with your life? People would really love that, wouldn’t
they?
SALLY
It would be a lot easier to sign up.
ERHARD
Yeah, it would be a lot easier to sign up, and we could charge more.
(laughter)
I want you to see how silly you are. If The Forum... You’d really have to believe it, wouldn’t
you? Otherwise it would be bullshit. Suppose after The Forum was all over, you had no doubt—
none—it was crystal clear to you that you had found out what you were supposed to do with
your life, really supposed to do. You would be very happy. Very happy. If you knew exactly
what you were supposed to do, what you’re really supposed to do, you’d be real happy, because
you’d have the answer. Julie?
Nothing: Beyond Nihilism
In An Introduction to Metaphysics, Heidegger points out that if
the fundamental question of metaphysics were to be put simply
as “Why are there beings?” then we would be starting from an
assumption of the being’s is-ness, its givenness as a being. But,
says Heidegger, with the addition of a second clause—“Why are
there beings at all instead of nothing?”—the givenness of the
being is thrown into question, and the being itself is held out “into
the possibility of not-being,” and thus begins “to waver” (IM 31).
Until we have confronted this possibility of non-Being, and have
thus opened ourselves to the other side of Being, we have not
appropriated our true nature: “Da-sein means: being held out into
the nothing” (“WM” in BW 103).
W
The event of nihilation is an essential element of Being:
“Being nihilates—as Being” (“LH” in BW 261). However, this
W
statement should not be heard as justifying charges that
Heidegger’s thinking is nihilism:
But where is the real nihilism at work? Where
one clings to current beings and believes it is
enough to take beings, as before, just as the
beings that they are. But with this, one rejects
the question of Being and treats Being as a
nothing (nihil), which in a certain way it even
“is,” insofar as it essentially unfolds. Merely to
chase aft er beings in the midst of the oblivion
of Being—that is nihilism. . . . In contrast, to
go expressly up to the limit of Nothing in the
question about Being, and to take Nothing into
the question of Being—this is the first and only
fruitful step toward the true overcoming of
nihilism. (IM 226

Forum Day Four: Session One

JULIE
And then I would start bitching.
ERHARD
Exactly. This is a wise woman. How does she know “then I would start bitching”? Because you
always bitch. That’s like shooting fi sh in a barrel, that kind of a prediction. I told you about the
Boy Scouts. It didn’t make any diff erence: “Today we’re going on a hike”; “Today we’re going
swimming.” “Oh no!” Everything was “oh no!” So, you can’t get anything out of this. I told you
the truth. You don’t use the truth; the truth uses you.
SALLY
Where I keep... I guess where I keep getting stuck is I want to get it so that possibility opens up.
ERHARD
That’s an in-order-to. That’s called a “rice Christian”: That’s when you go to church to get rice.
Getting paid. Most of you go to church in-order-to, don’t you? Sure you do. Don’t bullshit me. I
know why you go to church. You go to church in-order-to. It’s sacrilegious.
(asking a participant to stand up; turning back to Sally)
So you’ve just got to get rid of the in-order-tos: Whether you do or not is up to you, not up to me.
SALLY
But aren’t they just going to keep coming back?
ERHARD
Sure, they’re going to keep coming back; that’s why you’ve got to be able to dwell in that it’s
empty and meaningless, and that it’s empty and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless.
Dwell in; not believe, not understand, not remember. That’s why we don’t speak in concepts in
here, because concepts are things people remember and forget. Distinctions remember you. You
don’t remember them; they remember you. You don’t use them; they use you. That’s why we’ve
got this funny language. It’s the language of distinction, not the language of conceptualization.
(to Sally)
What else?
SALLY
I’m going to sit down, because I don’t know what there is I have to do.
ERHARD
There’s nothing you have to do.
Thus nihilism consists in the avoidance of the nothing, since by
avoiding nothingness, we in fact avoid the full disclosure of Being.
Thereby, we retain an incomplete apprehension of our possibility
as beings. Nevertheless, Heidegger does not deny that the “Nothing”
speaks something fundamentally disturbing:
The nothing itself does not attract; it is
essentially repelling. But this repulsion is
itself as such a parting gesture toward beings
that are submerging as a whole. This wholly
repelling gesture toward beings that are in
retreat as a whole, which is the action of the
nothing that oppresses Dasein in anxiety, is the
essence of the nothing: nihilation. It is neither
an annihilation of beings nor does it spring
from a negation. Nihilation will not submit
to calculation in terms of annihilation and
negation. The nothing itself nihilates. (“WM” in
BW 103
W
)
“
As Being and beings move apart, as Being withdraws into its
always-potential concealment, the everyday meaning of beings is
ongoingly subject to nihilation. Revealing and concealing, Being
gives and nothing nihilates. This is the way of the world. And in
the nihilating of the nothing lies the possibility of the clearing:
In the clear night of the nothing of anxiety the
original openness of beings as such arises: that
they are beings—and not nothing.  [. . .] The
essence of the originally nihilating nothing
lies in this, that it brings Da-sein for the first
time before beings as such. Only on the ground
of the original revelation of the nothing can
human existence approach and penetrate
beings. (“WM” in BW 103
W
)

SPEAKING BEING
SALLY
So then I’m going to sit down.
ERHARD
No. You’re only going to sit down if you do. You’re not going to sit down because there’s nothing
to do; you’re going to sit down if you sit down. And if you don’t sit down, you don’t sit down.
You’re not going to sit down “because.” You’re still trying to fi nd something to save you. There’s
no life rings in here. This is the place where we take all the life rings away. There’s nothing to
stand on. I want you to stand on nothing. I want you to stand on empty and meaningless. Meet
life with no foundation, with no background, with no learning. Yeah of course you have all the
learning and all the experience, but you’re not stuck with it. You’re not stuck with what you
know; you’re not stuck with your condition; you’re not stuck with your past.
SALLY
I have a question. So, if what I’m making it mean is that it’s hopeless: Are you saying that I
don’t have to make it mean that?
ERHARD
If what you’re making it mean is that it’s hopeless, what you want to do is to see that you are
making it mean that it’s hopeless. You’re doing that. Now, by the way: It is hopeless. And the
reason it’s hopeless is because of what you have to have if you’re going to have hope. There’s
only one thing you’ve got to have. Hope cannot exist without hopelessness. And the stronger
you get your hopes up, the more down in the swamp, down at the bottom of the Valley of the
Shadow of Death, down in the swamp there, is hopelessness. So the more hope you’ve got, the
more green slimy monsters there are down in the Valley of the Shadow of Death. Hopelessness.
It lives down in the swamp at the bottom of the Valley of the Shadow of Death, with all your
hope up there at the top, except the green slimy monsters keep you from ever being satisfi ed,
from ever being full of joy. Look, you make a drama up out of being tired. You should have seen
you the fi rst night. A true drama out of being tired; you make a fucking drama out of death.
That’s right, death is so nasty because you made a drama out of it. Death is nothing but dying.
It’s not a drama. Who said death was bad? You did. Okay fi ne: Pope. One thing. People worry
about death, right? What is there to worry about? Let me explain something to you: You are
going to die. Don’t worry. You are. You are going to die. And so is everybody else. Everybody
you love and care about, they’re all going to die. Don’t worry. They will.
(a participant objects)
You’re a bit nutty about this. You get up every time I talk about dying. And you know what?
You won’t die one minute before you do. And you want to know what? You won’t live one min-
ute longer when you’re dead. You don’t have to worry about that. It’s all taken care of. You’re
not going to die before you do and you’re not going to live after you die. Now you can worry
about something else. So that business about hope and hopelessness: It’s the same conversa-
tion about liking yourself. What is this hope crap? What does that change? What does that do?
What does that make? What is the value of hope? If you hope it’s going to turn out all right, that
This is an essential element of the approach to Being which is
taken in the dialogue of The Forum. To reach Being, one must
travel by way of the nothing. To discover possibility, one must
confront the facticity, the trap, of no-possibility. Further, what
Heidegger calls “authentic Being-towards-death,” or “freedom
towards death,” may be seen as consistent with these other
views: to experience the authentic possibility of one’s life, one
must confront one’s essential nullity. Conscience calls Dasein—
fallen into the untruth of the “they” self—to “appropriate
untruth authentically” (BT 345), to bring authenticity to one’s
T
inauthenticity, to be in the trap.
It is of the utmost importance, however, to stress again
this point: to “confront” means to experience an ontological
encounter, not merely an ontical or conceptual realization. For
r
instance, the merely ontic recognition that we all die is of course
commonplace. On the other hand, the ontological experience of
the death of one’s self as identity, and the deep realization of the
possibility of one’s self as an opening, with all the ramifications
of anxiety and homelessness which that experience entails, is far
from commonplace. This is the revelation of the nothing, the call
of conscience, which Heidegger posits as the ground for authentic
existence, and this is the encounter for which the rhetorical
structure of The Forum is designed.
Authentic inquiry into Being is likely to arouse resistance,
and this resistance may be located precisely at the juncture
where Being’s other side, the Nothing, must be confronted. Here
is the true challenge of Heidegger’s thinking, which Caputo calls
“the danger of Heidegger’s path”: at this juncture “there are no
assurances,” and “in this darkness and uncertainty lies one of the
largest difficulties with Heidegger’s work” (The Mystical Element
l
in Heidegger’s Thought 245). Caputo quotes Paul Huhnerfeld,
who has compared Heidegger’s way with religious paths to
transformation, such as that of the Christian mystic Meister
Eckhart: “Meister Eckhart would never have taken the mystical
step if he had believed that he was leaping into Nothingness
instead of into the arms of God” (245).

makes it turn out all right, right? Or it’s going to turn out wrong if you hope it’s going to turn
out so you don’t dare hope. It’s voodoo. That’s nuts. That’s a guy following me with a knife with
blood dripping down from it: “Don’t look! But you can’t see him anyhow, only I can see him.”
(laughter)
Look, what are you hoping for? You’re hoping it’ll all be all right, huh?
SALLY
Yeah.
ERHARD
But it won’t be all right. It’ll be the way it is. It won’t be any diff erent from the way it is. That’s
the way it will be. It’ll be the way that it is. And all you’re doing is making a drama out of it. Is
that clear?
SALLY
Yes.
ERHARD
If you like making dramas out of it go ahead. What you do with your life is none of my busi-
ness. That’s not my business, that’s your business.
SALLY
So there’s no good or bad, there’s just the way it is.
Erhard’s manner is very relaxed and casual at this point, ranging freely in volume from loud to
intimate.
ERHARD
There is good and bad. Go out there and shoot someone; then you’ll fi nd out how bad it is.
SALLY
All right, that’s where I’m stuck then, because...
ERHARD
I know you’re stuck. I know how you were brought up.
(laughter)
Yeah, there is good and bad, but not inherently. Inherently there’s nothing. Was there goodness
in the rainstorm when the fl ood came from the rain that killed people? Don’t you see that that’s
insane? The rainstorm isn’t good or bad it’s a goddamn rainstorm. Where does good and bad
exist? In a conversation. And that conversation has a lot of force to it. You exist in a particular
culture; a particular religious culture, a particular ethnic culture, a particular national cul-
ture, a particular family culture, and that’s where good and bad arose from. It’s a phenomenon
Caputo finds in this aspect of Heidegger’s thought a “serious
difficulty”: “It does not seem to me that many of Heidegger’s
excited and enthusiastic followers, who speak like Heidegger, as
though they have experienced what Heidegger experienced, have
recognized the austerity of Heidegger’s path or acknowledged the
danger which lies along this path” (252–253). The danger of the
path, says Caputo, lies in the powerlessness of human beings who
travel it, and in their inability to find secure ground and comfort
in the mysterious realm of Being, whose apparently arbitrary
nature Heidegger has described here, explicating Fragment 52 of
Heraclitus, as “play”:
The “because” withers away in the play. The
play is without “why.” It plays since it plays.
It simply remains a play: the most elevated
and the most profound. But this “simply”
is everything, the one, the only. Nothing is
without ground/reason. Being and ground/
reason: the same. Being, as what grounds,
has no ground; as the abyss it plays the play
that, as Geschick [destiny], passes [B]eing and
k
ground/reason to us. The question remains
whether and how we, hearing the movements
of this play, play along and accommodate
ourselves to the play. (PR 113)
“
Thus, for Caputo, Heidegger’s thought moves “close to the edge of
despair. For he makes us dependent upon the outcome of a ‘game’
upon which our very essence is staked, a game in which thinking
may lend a hand but in which it has no final say” (251–252).
The diff iculty with Heidegger is not that he is
a mystic, but that he is not. His thought is so
radically worldly and secular and drained of
absolute and divine assurances that it can at
best assist in a world-play; for the kingdom is
in the hands of a child. (252)

which arises only in language. There is no good or bad outside of language. Now good and bad
is very real stuff . But it’s a phenomenon that only exists in language.
(loudly)
Listen up, goddamn it! You’ve stopped thinking again. You think you’ve got it so you don’t have
to think. The fl oor as an object exists independent of language. That clear? For whom is that
not clear? Put your hand up if that isn’t clear?
(looking around the room)
The existence of the fl oor as an object doesn’t require language. Is that clear?
(pausing)
Good. Is there any such thing as art independent of language? Where there is no language,
is there art? No, because art is a phenomenon that arises only in language. Now you assholes
think I said art’s not real and fl oors are. I didn’t say that. Art is very real. It alters the course of
history, has a profound impact on the culture, changes people’s lives, brings things into peo-
ple’s lives that would not be there were it not for art. It’s very real stuff . It’s real, and it does not
exist independent of language. Art is a phenomenon that only arises in language. Is that clear?
There’s no such thing as beauty independent of language. Beauty is a phenomenon which only
arises in language. There’s no such thing as beauty independent of language. Beauty is real,
and it does not exist independent of language. You need to start thinking and stop believing.
You believe too much. There is no such thing as art or beauty or design, no such thing as
love and happiness. None of the things that are important to you in life exist independent of
language. Birds don’t build homes. Nests are hard-wired into birds. You don’t understand that
then don’t get engaged in the conversation. That part of the conversation. Only agents with lan-
guage, only people build homes. Homes are a phenomenon that only arises, only in language.
So there’s no such thing as beauty or art. Here’s what you want to get out of this. Not beauty or
art: This is not a course on aesthetics. What you want to get out of it is that there are certain
phenomena that arise only in language. Over where your dog is, nothing is bad. You know
where bad is for your dog? Where you are. That’s where bad arises to the dog, because bad is
a phenomenon that only exists in language. Independent of language there is no bad. There is
no bad in an earthquake for the earthquake. There’s only bad for people with language...sorry:
entities with language. And that’s the same thing about good. But it’s very real stuff . It’s not
unreal. Now, language comes out of silence, which is a form of empty and meaningless. Good
and bad come out of nothing. It doesn’t come out of inherent good or bad. It’s not like you can
ignore it. It’s not like it isn’t true. It’s real stuff , and it arises only in language. You can’t report
that something is good. You can’t give a report that something is bad. Good and bad only arise
in language. You can’t talk about something being good: Now you do, don’t you? That’s because
you’re stupid. You talk about things being good and bad. You talk in ignorance that what you’re
talking about when you talk about good and bad is talking. That’s like talking about talking,
you understand? When you talk about good and bad you’re talking about talking.
(to Sally)
You were saying?
Caputo’s point is important, and is central to a consideration
of the path which Heidegger is inviting us to follow. The authors
of this book are certainly among those whom Caputo has
described as “excited and enthusiastic” about the possibilities
of Heidegger’s thinking. However, we do not claim to have
“experienced what Heidegger experienced”: we do feel an affinity
for that realm of experience about which he speaks; that affinity
is due, at least in part, to our participation in the work of Werner
Erhard. Thus, in the face of Caputo’s challenge, we must ask
ourselves whether we have truly confronted the “austerity and
danger” of Heidegger’s path.
This is a question that must be asked persistently—a
question which must be stood within, rather than answered—
since Being must be continually wrested from, and contextualized
by, non-Being. The nihilation of the nothing must be ongoing. But
the original encounter is fraught with agon, that is, with contest:
human resistance to confronting the Nothing is fundamental.
The Nothing’s enormity so violates our everyday identity that we
instinctively close ourselves to the possibility which it contains.
Heidegger states:
We are so finite that we cannot even bring
ourselves originally before the [N]othing
through our own decision and will. So
profoundly does finitude entrench itself in
existence that our most proper and deepest
limitation refuses to yield to our freedom.
(“WM” in BW 106)
W
“
Therefore, the struggle to provide an authentic confrontation with
the austerity of the Nothing, and to overcome the resistance to its
realization, is a central element of The Forum.
The important questions to be considered in comparing
Heidegger with religious models of transformation, such as
Meister Eckhart, are these: what might be the transformative
power of a leap into the truly unknown rather than into the
arms of a comforting and fatherly God? Might not the “danger”
of Heidegger’s thinking, that abysmal lack of certainty which
characterizes his leap, in fact constitute its possibility? Might not
ERHARD (continuing)
