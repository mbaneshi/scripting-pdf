for being complete. Everything is for making up for that there’s something wrong here. What
gives you your life—more accurately, sorry, more accurately—what gives you your self, what
gives you your identity, the person you’ve built yourself into being, was built in response to
(speaking each syllable with equally intense emphasis)
that there is some-thing pro-found-ly wrong. Now if you need evidence, what you’ve got to use
for evidence is “what is it that’s left you full of joy?” What is it? Look, there are eight hundred
people in here in this room. There’s got to be some pretty remarkable accomplishments in this
room. People of remarkable accomplishment; there’s got to be people in here who have made
ridiculous contributions. There’s got to be people in here who have saved people’s lives, there’s
got to be people in here who have nurtured people’s lives, there’s got to be people in here who
have impacted whole communities, there may be people here who have made important,
signifi cant contributions to countries, and there’s not one person in here satisfi ed. Not one
person in here truly, completely, wholly fulfi lled. Not one person in here full of joy. That’s my
evidence.

PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 8)
I’ve done some looking at this and I have a question and we can use me as a case in point.
When I was in the third or fourth grade, a few things happened close together, where I got
really embarrassed, and I decided that no one was going to embarrass me that way again. No
one is ever going to laugh at me again. Out of that I became a master student, head of the class,
straight A’s all the way through college. Awards, degrees, all sorts of honors and no satisfaction.
My fi rst wife made a fool of me and so in my second marriage I married someone that would
never leave me. It’s all a solution to “no one is ever going to make a fool of me again.”
ERHARD
Right.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 8)
So all the things you’re saying I can really see in my life, where what could really be
accomplishments are I’m making a point and I’m making sure there’s no satisfaction.
ERHARD
Right because there’s no satisfaction in compensating for being “there’s something profoundly
wrong here.” All you do is what? Reinforce down there at the bottom that there’s something
wrong here.
(asking a participant to stand up; Erhard pushes against his shoulders)
It’s kind of like this: whatever you’re pushing up against, you’re attached to. I’m attached to
him, just as surely if he held me close to him. In fact I’m more attached to him than if he held
me close to him because he doesn’t have to do any of the work; I do all the work.

the uncanniest possibility of Dasein shows
itself: to break the excessive violence of
Being through Dasein’s ultimate act of vio-
lence against itself. Dasein does not have this
possibility as an empty way out, but it is this
s
possibility insofar as it is; for as Dasein, it must
indeed shatter against Being in every act of
violence. (IM 197)
M
As we show in our series of sidebars on Technology (during the
third and final session of Day Four), The Forum provides an
opportunity for Dasein’s calculative machinations to be seen for
what they are, and the game is up. Yet only through this struggle
can Dasein become itself, and serve its constitutive role as the
site for the disclosure of Being: the struggle is “an act of violence
against the overwhelming, but at the same time always and only
for it” (IM 196).
Heidegger has at times described this ongoing struggle in
oppressive terminology:
“
the renewed resurgence of the act of violence
against Being, in such a way that the almighty
sway of Being violates Dasein (in the literal
sense), makes Dasein into the site of its appear-
ing, envelops and pervades Dasein in its sway,
and thereby holds it within Being. (IM 198)
M
In his later work, it must be noted, Heidegger’s languaging of
unconcealment is less violent: it is articulated more gently as a
turning-toward Being, a releasement of and into Being. However,
we emphasize the element of resistance here (as has Heidegger)
because such resistance characterizes much of the dialogue
in The Forum (as well as many discussions of Erhard himself).
Erhard does not attempt to minimize this resistance; in fact, he
acts strategically to unconceal it. For instance, early on Day One of
The Forum, aft er confronting the participant Bill concerning being
pressured to be in The Forum, Erhard asked, “Why was I bad with

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (continuing)
(participant sits down)
So if your accomplishments are there as an answer to that there’s something wrong, to make
up for that there’s something wrong, to deal with that there’s something wrong, then the more
you accomplish the more powerfully the context—listen!—the more powerfully the context that
there’s something wrong is established. See look...
(moving to the chalk board.)
Remember the two circles, “tall” in two contexts? Suppose the context is “there is something
wrong.” The more content you build, the more achievement, the more accomplishment, the
more content builds, the more fulfi lled the context becomes. Anybody who can’t see that?
SUZANNE
I don’t understand.
ERHARD
Okay, thank you.
SUZANNE
I don’t understand the statement that the more achievement one has, that there’s something
wrong.
ERHARD
Good. Did you see that she asked the question very precisely? Real big opening to get the
answer. What I said was that “that there’s something wrong” becomes—you become that
there’s something wrong; you are that there is something wrong. In other words, “that there is
something wrong” is the clearing in which life happens now. It’s the opening for life to occur.
It’s the space in which everything arises. You clear about that statement so far? That’s not the
answer yet, but are you clear about that so far?
SUZANNE
Is it, “that there’s something wrong,” is it the cause and the achievement is the eff ect? Or...
ERHARD
Not quite, no. Sorry. The answer is no, and it’s like that, but it’s not that. It’s “that there’s
something wrong” is the context, and the achievement is the content in that context.
SUZANNE
So, the achievement is not an eff ect of “there’s something wrong.” It’s a context.
ERHARD
It is a content of the context “there is something wrong.” See hold on for a second. This business
about cause and eff ect you and I understand, and are very comfortable with. You don’t have
to think that, you have those thoughts. You think in a cause/eff ect world. But the world of
you just now? Because I want to get this story up. There’s a lot of
people with that story here and I want to get that story killed.”
This unconcealing clears the way for the appropriation of the
resistance: participants in the dialogue, by recognizing, allowing,
and owning their resistance, become who they are, in preparation
for the disclosure of their possibility.
Lest the view of Dasein as scene-of-violent-unconcealment be
taken as unduly negative, Heidegger adds an important point:
“
This [talk of violence] looks like pessimism. But
it would be preposterous to label Greek Dasein
with this term—not because the Greeks were
somehow optimists at bottom aft er all, but
because these assessments miss Greek Dasein
altogether. The Greeks were, to be sure, more
pessimistic than a pessimist can ever be. They
were also more optimistic than any optimist.
Their historical Dasein had not yet entered the
realm of pessimism and optimism. (IM 197–198)
M
This way of thinking, in which relatedness with Being allows
the transcendence of subjective value dualities, appears to come
into play within Heidegger’s and Erhard’s ethics. While the results
of The Forum, to whatever degree they manifest themselves in
participants’ lives, are certainly played out in the moral arena,
morals (and their contemporary variation, “values”) are an ontic
issue, and the essential content of The Forum is ontological.
Here we think Joseph J. Kockelmans, synthesizing Heidegger,
expresses Erhard’s view as well: “Every valuing, even if it values
in a positive manner, is and remains a subjectivizing; it does not
let beings be. To call God the highest value is to degrade the true
essence of God” (On the Truth of Being 258). Being is not moral.
Being “is” not anything except Being.
The rhetorical conversation of The Forum, rather than taking
morality as its content, approaches morality indirectly, by way
of Being. Here, we wish to underline Heidegger’s point: that the
violence of the act of unconcealing Being is the “flip side” of the
