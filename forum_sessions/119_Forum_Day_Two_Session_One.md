Forum Day Two: Session One

(Lisa shakes her head)
Clear?
LISA
Yes.
ERHARD
Anybody else not get this?
(another participant stands)
MASON
So you’re saying it’s never possible that it’s people in general? It could be one person?
ERHARD
There’s no such thing as “people” happening.
MASON
So it could be Frank doesn’t like me.
ERHARD
Yeah. “People don’t like me” is always a story, isn’t it?
MASON
I got that.
ERHARD
“People don’t like me” never happened. “Nobody liked me” never happened. Always a story,
right?
(to Marsha)
What happened?
MARSHA
What happened is, from Kindergarten through fourth grade was fun. In the fi fth grade girls
were developing, noticing boys, but I was still in pigtails...
ERHARD
Hold on. You wanna start being able to be with people here. Whatever you were yesterday isn’t
going to work today. You have to be powerfully with people. You’ve got to be up on the edge
of your chair when this woman is giving you a gift you ain’t going to get again. You’re going to
Werner Erhard, who found in Heidegger’s vocabulary a way of
expanding the value that his own work made available, discussed
the nature of giving in a 1989 satellite telecast from New York City.
“
A distinction gives. It comes into existence
by giving. . . .  You’ve got to be able to think
something coming into existence in the act
of giving existence. Distinguishing arises in
the act of giving—hard for us to think about
because we can only think serially. I’m ask-
ing you to think of a new kind of relationship
called giving. . . . This is getting to the essence
of Being. There’s no such thing as Being. You
can’t separate Being from the world, therefore
there’s no such thing as Being. . . . Being arises
in the act of giving. (“Beyond the Winning
Formula”)
Reflexive languaging demands that thinking bend back on itself.
Such languaging is inherent in thinking about Being; note how that
very phrase tickles the mind.
While Heidegger’s writing is oft en considered to be highly
complex, he suggests an alternate view: “What is strange in the
thinking of Being is its simplicity. Precisely this keeps us from it”
(“LH” in BW 263, emphasis added). Heidegger teases out this idea
W
further in his “Letter on Humanism.” At one point in the letter,
when considering the role of language in Being, he calls attention
to a specific instance of its simplicity:
“
But just now an example of the inconspicu-
ous deed of thinking manifested itself. For to
the extent that we expressly think the usage
“bring to language,” which was granted to
language, think only that and nothing fur-
ther, to the extent that we retain this thought
in the heedfulness of saying as what in the
future continually has to be thought, we have
brought something of the essential unfolding
of Being itself to language. (“LH” in BW 263)

SPEAKING BEING
go back out of here three days from now, and nobody’s gonna talk this straight to you. You’re
going to go out and have those chicken shit conversations with people. So you want to get what
you can out of this. And you aren’t going to be able to see this in yourself until you can see it
in Marsha. All that sadness of the fi fth grader is there right now. Marsha’s got a fi fth grader
running her life. This is a mature, attractive, confi dent, accomplished woman with a fi fth grader
calling the shots.
(to Marsha)
You were saying?
MARSHA
Suddenly there was a distinction. It was not okay with the other girls that I was not growing up.
They starting getting in like a clique. And...
ERHARD
Talking behind your back and excluding you, and no longer was there that kind of loose easy
sense of being with people. Now it was a drama to be with people: a kind of plot; a kind of
strategy.
MARSHA
What I saw worked a little bit was to start getting happy, bubbly.
ERHARD
So this is pretty intelligent for a fi fth grader. It makes very good sense for a ten-year-old girl to
say the answer to this is to be happy all the time. You got to remember this is Marsha inventing
Marsha. This is Marsha inventing her identity. She has happiness as a way to push away sad-
ness. Then what happened?
MARSHA
As we grew up, they were the attractive ones, the cheerleaders; the boys were interested in
them...
ERHARD
Listen up here, because this is about to get really stupid. Here is a really attractive woman who’s
going to tell you she was not in with the girls who were attractive. Stupid in the sense that this
is not logical.
MARSHA
Up until the fi fth grade I was called ___, after my ninety year old aunt who was an “old maid.”
ERHARD (to the group, lightly)
How come men are bachelors and women are called old maids? I don’t get it.
ERHARD (continuing)
In considering reflexive languaging, one is immediately reminded
of koan meditation—the process in which a Zen student is assigned
a single problematic phrase upon which he or she meditates until
its embedded ontological hurdle has been made. The paradigmatic
koan is the question, “What is the sound of one hand clapping?”
Heidegger’s paragraph above, considered carefully, pulls one
toward koan-like thinking.
Michael E. Zimmerman has likened Heidegger’s use of
aporia—unresolvable problems—to the existential puzzles found
in koans. As an example, he cites the aporic conceptual dilem-
ma, central to Heidegger’s thought, that Being is inconceivable
except as a being, and yet no being can be a being without a prior
experience of its Being. As Zimmerman points out, the solution
to such aporia is beyond the capabilities of rational thought; and
this is precisely the power of reflexion, that it turns the thinker’s
thinking reflexively in upon itself, demanding a diff erent kind of
d
thinking and thus a diff erent thinker: “Before one can speak about
the diff erence between Being and beings, it is crucial that one put
oneself in the position of being able to experience that diff erence”
(“Heidegger and Heraclitus on Spiritual Practice” 100). Participants
in The Forum have put themselves in that position.
The experience of engaging one’s mind with a profoundly
relexive idea may be imagined as the process of revving an engine
so hard that the torque sends it flying off  its mounts. This image
calls to our minds the way participants in The Forum “get it” aft er
several days of struggling to understand it conceptually.
Reflexive languagings, and the thinking they demand, are cen-
tral in the work of both Heidegger and Erhard. Erhard distinguishes
thinking from having thoughts, and he hints at the diff erence using
such languaging as “This statement is false,” “I always lie,” or “A
superstition is a superstition only when it isn’t a superstition, and
a superstition isn’t a superstition only when it is a superstition.”
Such statements call for thinking, call for the movement of thought
l
through the structure given in language. ■
