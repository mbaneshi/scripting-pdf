Forum Day Four: Session Three 505
ERHARD (continuing to laughter)
That’s you. You’re “oh shit!” That’s how we know when you got back.
(laughter; indicating third empty circle)
So a lot of what the second half of The Forum is about is access to this domain. And you and I
are not going to do as good a job at access to that domain as you were getting to zero, because
you all were a pain in the ass and it took too long to get to zero. If you didn’t hear me making
you wrong, I was just making you wrong.
(laughter)
The other side of that is that we haven’t gotten our shit together to get The Forum to zero
quickly enough to do a good job on the second half. That’s making me wrong. You notice
nothing changes, no matter who’s wrong?
(laughter and applause)
The point is that we can’t do very much more than open up the second half of The Forum.
That’s as much as we can get done, because you all need your beauty sleep.
(laughter)
Okay, so what is this domain? If it’s not experiential, and it isn’t; it’s not conceptual, and it isn’t:
What is that domain?
(writing “possibility” in the third circle)
Simple. It’s the domain of possibility. Not this possibility or that possibility,
(indicating the “story” circle)
...that’s here. You could say that it’s the possibility of possibility. But there’s no such domain.
No matter where you go to look for it you can’t fi nd it. You can’t have it unless you invent it.
You have to invent the possibility of possibility. You want to listen to that. People don’t have
possibility in their lives. They have options. Options are futures generated from the past. The
past could work out like this, or it could work out like that. You know, common conversation
between people. Things could work out like this, or they could work out like that. “They’re
likely to work out like this, but oh boy would I love them to work out like that, but that is
not very likely.” That is not possibility; that is “options.” Options are conceptual. And your
experience—listen up—your experience will mostly be limited to the options that you give
yourself to experience. It’s the vicious circle all over again.
(indicating the “story” circle)
The options are here. Why do I call them options? Because they’re derived from your past
experiences! The options shape your future experience. And the option-shaped experiences
reinforce the options. So now you fi nally got yourself fi gured out so you don’t need to get
up in the morning anymore, because there’s nowhere to go. Why bother? You already know
how it’s going to be, so why bother? The only reason why most of you get up is because you
506
SPEAKING BEING
like suff ering. That’s a psychiatric problem called masochism. Go to a psychiatrist to get that
handled. We don’t handle that in here. But most of you get up because you like suff ering. I
mean, you must like suff ering: That’s what you do. And you know you’re going to do it. No,
what gets you up is hoping, hoping you’re going to make it, hoping it’s all going to work out,
hoping it’s somehow going to be diff erent, hoping you’re going to get the answer. What’s that?
(in response to a participant calling out, Erhard repeats)
Yeah. You suff er hoping. Exactly. Hoping keeps you suff ering. Why would you bother getting up
in the morning if you know what it’s going to be like?
(walking back to the chalkboard to indicate the “possibility” circle)
At any rate, you’ve got something to say here. You’ve got nothing to say about experience—you
can only report on it more or less accurately.
(indicating the “story” circle)
And you’re limited to what you say here reporting on experience. This is reporting on that.
(indicating the “possibility” circle)
Here you are free. Now, there’s one little catch. A pipe dream is not a possibility. Pipe dreams
and possibility are not the same thing. Possibility is the future. You could say that the past could
have possibly been like this. But in the future, we might learn that the past was really diff erent
than what we thought. Possibility is always future. It’s got that kind of temporality: future. And
you’re going to have pipe dreams and call them possibility. I’ll tell you how to tell the diff erence
between a pipe dream and possibility. There is no future, which will ever be realized, which is
not an extension of the past when it happens. All futures will be an extension of the past. There
are no discontinuous futures. Not in your lifetime, because all futures, when realized, have a
continuity with the past. There is nothing that ever happened that was inconsistent with the
past. If necessary, the past is rewritten. On the basis of Columbus and Einstein, the past was
rewritten. See, it was true the world was fl at, until someone did something inconsistent with
that. Then we said, oh, it wasn’t fl at. How the hell do you know it wasn’t fl at? The point is that
you’re free to create possibilities for your life and you want to ground those possibilities by
bringing the possibility back into the present. Like standing in the future to create a future. And
then you tease it back to the present, so there’s a structure to fulfi ll that possibility. But that’s too
technical, and we don’t have the time to go into all the technicalities tonight. All I’m going to
tell you is this: If you live with possibility, you live with both risk and power. None of this works;
it’s only empowering. None of this is the answer, and it is empowering. Life is authentically
risky. You got the wrong idea about life. You think life is about reducing the risk with fi nding the
answers. You want to cheat. If you want to reduce the risk, play tennis with three-year-olds. You
win all the time. Makes you feel great.
(laughter)
If winning all the time makes you feel great then you like playing tennis with three-year-olds.
Winning doesn’t make people feel great. Being powerful and able and playing and dancing,
that makes people feel great. And to do that you’ve got to have power, and that’s what we’re
ERHARD (continuing)
All I’m going to tell you is this: If you live with
possibility, you live with both risk and power.
None of this works; it’s only empowering. None
of this is the answer, and it is empowering. Life
is authentically risky.
“
Forum Day Four: Session Three 507
talking about here: What we’re talking about here is empowering yourself, not reducing the
risk. We’re not talking about giving you the answers so that you know how to beat people; it
just reduces life and people to a three-year-old. That’s silly. If the point was getting to the top of
Mount Everest, some goddamn entrepreneur would put an elevator on it. The question is: How
powerful and how able can you be in the face of the risk called Mount Everest?
(pausing)
Okay. So we’re almost home. We’ve got two more defi nite steps. And the fi rst step is a step
called responsibility. Remember the choice exercise? You discovered something about choice
that was inconsistent with the interpretation you already had that choice was, and that there’s
a certain power to distinguishing choice the way you distinguished it during the exercise. Same
thing about responsibility. The fi rst thing you want to get is, responsibility is not blame or guilt
or fault. When I say I’m responsible, I’m not saying I did it, or I am to blame or that I’m guilty.
When I say I’m responsible, what I mean is that I stand for being cause in the matter. Not “I
caused it.” It’s a stand for being cause in the matter.
(indicating the “possibility” circle)
And you can’t take a stand without this domain. Without this domain, your stand is a mere
position. Some position you’ve taken on the matter. I don’t know if you’ve been watching this
over the past four days, but your positions have gotten you into a lot of hot water. Your positions
have ruined your life a little bit. Or a whole lot.
(pausing)
Without this domain... See, a possibility is established by taking a stand for something as a
possibility. A position is established by setting something up as something toward which you
are working. Possibility is something you are free to realize, which is diff erent than something
you are working towards. It’s like you’re free to realize whatever it is that you’re willing to stand
for. That’s diff erent from working towards something. Can you imagine: Working toward hitting
the ball over the net in tennis does not make great tennis? Or working toward dancing. My
mother only made one mistake in raising me. She sent me to the Bala Cynwyd Women’s Club to
learn to dance. This was a big mistake.
(laughter)
Knowing where to put your feet is not dancing. I didn’t know that for a long time.
(indicating the “possibility” circle)
The action in this realm is declaration.
(indicating the “story” circle)
The action in this realm is assertion.
(indicating the “what happened” circle)
The action here is expressives. These are Speech Acts, but that’ll get too complicated. To
understand declaration, you have to go to an umpire convention.
See, a possibility is established by taking a
stand for something as a possibility. A position
is established by setting something up as some-
thing toward which you are working. Possibil-
ity is something you are free to realize, which
is diff erent than something you are working
towards. It’s like you’re free to realize whatev-
er it is that you’re willing to stand for. That’s
diff erent from working towards something.

SPEAKING BEING
Here Erhard told the story about the three umpires: the rookie umpire who said he “calls them like
they are,” the experienced umpire who said he calls them “like I see them,” and the master umpire,
who said “They ain’t anything until I call them something.”
ERHARD
That’s declaration. See, the umpire’s got the power of declaration. What is it? If President Carter
wakes up in the middle of the night, says “to hell with glasnost, I’m sending the bombs out,”
what does Rosalynn say? “Shut up, Jimmy, go to sleep.” But if President Bush does it, Barbara
runs for the bomb shelter. Actually, the president doesn’t do that, but never mind; it ruins the
story if I go into that. This power of declaration: That’s what it takes to be responsible, because
being responsible is merely a declaration. It is the declaration that one is cause in the matter. It’s
not a description of the case. It’s not a report on the facts: It’s a place to stand in life regarding
what you care about. When I’m in India, I say the people who are hungry are responsible for
their hunger. And the bleeding hearts have a problem with that. But I’ll tell you, if you are
responsible for your hunger you’re a lot more powerful than if you’re a victim of being hungry.
It’s quite clear to me that the hungry do not want to be hungry, and the hungry would not
have it that way if they had the opportunity to do something about it. It’s quite clear to me that
it takes more courage to live one day there than it takes for me to live ten years. But treating
people as if they have no responsibility is disempowering to people. Now you can’t argue that
you’re responsible, because that’s not a declaration, is it? That’s an assertion, an argument. A
declaration has to be done freely, not coerced. You’ve got to have the power of declaration, and
the power of declaration is a product of freedom. It’s a privilege to be responsible, not a burden
to be responsible. “I am cause in the matter” is a stand for giving yourself power, not a report
on the facts or the circumstances. It’s clear to me that I’m the cause in the matter of people’s
hunger. I make that declaration; it gives me power with regard to the issue of hunger. It’s not a
report on the fact that I did it. It’s a place to stand from which one has power. If it’s not my fault,
if I didn’t do it—but none of that interests me—whose fault is it? Somebody gets to be wrong
and somebody gets to be right. That’s the point.
(indicating the “possibility” circle)
The realm of possibility is also the realm of responsibility. Most people are never going to be
responsible because that realm doesn’t exist; you have to invent it. One of the things we haven’t
told you is what you’re going to get out of being in The Forum. Listen up! What you’re going to
get out of The Forum—yeah you’re going to get a lot of nice things and good things, but that’s
all chicken shit. What you’re really going to get out of The Forum is whatever you’re willing to
stand for having gotten out of The Forum. You’re not going to get out of The Forum what we
gave you because we can’t give you anything of value. You know, all these people are not here
because we have something valuable to give to people. You can’t get anything valuable from
other people. Like “be given it.” Chicken shit is what we get from one another. But you can give
yourself something valuable. You can give yourself something extraordinarily valuable. You
can give yourself something that will last the rest of your life. You can give yourself something
that will make it that your life is never the same. So here’s my promise: I promise that you can
have anything out of The Forum you’re willing to stand for having gotten. I also promise you
What you’re really going to get out of The
Forum is whatever you’re willing to stand for
having gotten out of The Forum.
“
Forum Day Four: Session Three 509
won’t get anything else out of The Forum that’s worth anything. What you’ll get out of your
participation in The Forum is what you’re willing to stand for having gotten. You don’t get
what you’re checking to see if you’ve gotten...” Let me see, what happened to me? Did my mind
change? Did my feelings change? Did my eyesight change? Am I taller? Am I thinner? Do I
feel better?” You can’t have any of that. If you’re willing to stand for having been empowered
in here, you can walk out of here empowered. That’s the truth. This isn’t some airy-fairy crap.
You are not the fi rst people I have done this work with. This is grounded on a lot of evidence.
You paid your $625. You bust your ass for four days, you still got one evening to go. Whatever
possibility you’re willing to stand for, whatever conversation for possibility you’re willing to
generate, that’s what you will have gotten. Whatever possibility you’re willing to stand for, that’s
what you can have. What you’ve done in here has given you the power to realize what you’re
willing to stand for, not like a formula, but like a possibility in which you can act and be. Not
like a guaranteed outcome, not like playing tennis with a three-year-old; being fully at risk, but
being fully empowered in the face of the risk. If you don’t like risk, you don’t like life. So we’re
up to the last thing now. Kind of. I say kind of because I never know what’s really last. Who has
any questions?
A participant raised his hand.
RICHARD
I got what I paid my money for. What has happened in the last few months is that my projects
have become so successful that they’re bigger than my possibility for them.
ERHARD
You hear what he said? He used up the world of possibility. The content has overwhelmed
the context. He’s created a possibility and has related to that possibility powerfully enough,
with the power to fulfi ll the possibility such that the content is overwhelming the context.
You know what a hero is? Not what you think a hero is. A hero is not some dashing fi gure, an
extraordinary person. Only ordinary people can be heroes. A hero is an ordinary person who
dares to recognize and accept the call of a possibility bigger than themselves. Real simple.
A hero is an ordinary person who sees, who hears, who is open to, and accepts the call of a
possibility bigger than themselves, or herself or himself.
CECILIA
I’ve accomplished a lot and I’m an artist and illustrator. I’ve done book publishing, and so all
this work is sixty percent solitary at least, and I’ve been having this conversation for years that
I ought to go participate with other people. And so once and a while I go do that from “ought
to.” I’ve done some good things but in the end I say “Jeez! That was a mistake. I wish I had done
that by myself after all.” I mean the nurturing is kind of awful out here and I’ve been doing this
work for years going in and out of that. And what I fi nally got these last four days was that it’s
never going to work if I think I have to go and do it. It’s like “Gee, I already like this thing I’m
doing: painting. It’s meaningless, so I’ll just do it!” But I also got that I had killed off  one of the
main human attributes, which was love.

SPEAKING BEING
CECILIA (continuing; breaking into tears)
What I can do now is go out and be with you all from my love for you all, rather than because I
think I ought to.
ERHARD
Very nice.
(applause)
HENRY
I’m speaking and listening and it’s like the fi rst time. I’ve been stingy and this is the fi rst time
that I’m not. I called my father and my mother. I told them that I loved them and they told me
they loved me. I told them they were okay by me. My father said, “Well that’s interesting!” I
asked him if I was okay by him and he said “Sure you’re okay by me.” My relationships with my
mother and father are complete. I say so.
ERHARD
By the way: They are if you say so. Not like you want to say so. You’ve got to be free to say so.
You can’t say so in-order-to. You’ve got to be standing where what you say is so. We’ll talk about
that in a moment. Please go on.
HENRY
Everything that I’ve accomplished in my thirty-two years of my life is empty and meaningless. I’m
okay with that. My life is perfect. What’s happened for me in the last several days is... I’m standing
here trembling in awe and respect and gratitude for the incredible space of listening that you’ve
created. I’m expressing myself for the fi rst time. The parts of The Forum that have been diffi  cult
for me—I’m going through The Forum thinking I’m the only one going through this. But I’ve
seen myself in everybody’s share and it hasn’t been diffi  cult or painful. It’s been great. I’ve gotten
it: My back pain is gone, the stuff y nose is gone. I’ve got beyond the fi ve-year-old. I was that “I
can’t remember beyond fi ve-years-old.” I don’t know whether I’m remembering what happened
or remembering the story, but I’ve started to remember when I was very young. And what that
frees up for me: I couldn’t own what was invisible to me. The racket, which came from incidents
that were invisible to me and blocked out from me, kept coming up, and the incidents were so
far back, way earlier than I’ve ever looked before. Even though I’ve done the training before, I’ve
never experienced what I have now. I’ve always shared to look good, and now I’m sharing to
contribute. I feel like the amount of time that people will listen to me is very short, and so I speak
fast, cram it all in and nobody gets it. And I’m just worse off  afterwards. It was an in-order-to.
ERHARD
Say what’s there instead of talking about it. I didn’t say, “say it fast,” I said “say what’s there.”
You may have already said what you stood up to say, which is “I love you. And I respect you.
And I acknowledge you.” If you’ve got something beyond that to say, say it. But get to the punch
line. If you’re going to talk, do it eff ectively.
The Oblivion of Oblivion
As we stated earlier, Heidegger’s perspective on technology is an
important element in the understanding of Werner Erhard’s work
that we are developing here. Dreyfus finds a useful summary of
this perspective in the response of HAL, the computer/robot in
Forum Day Four: Session Three 511
HENRY
My promise is that the twenty-fi ve year racket that I’ve lived—I’m giving that up and am now
living out the distinction ecological health. I appreciate you very much, and I love you all.
ERHARD
Okay good. Thank you.
ZELDA
What do you mean: to stand for?
ERHARD
Declare the possibility of...; live out of the possibility of...; have as the context for living, the
possibility of...; Generate a conversation for...; create a context for...
ZELDA
I understand that. It says to me to be generous.
ERHARD
I’m not asking you to be generous. You will be generous if you do that. I’m not asking you to be
generous, because that would mean for you to have a quality inside yourself called generous.
If you act on the off er to have anything out of The Forum you are willing to stand for having
gotten... if you act on the off er you will be being generous. Generosity arises in an act of being.
It’s not a property inside of people that gets expressed in their actions. You get that?
ZELDA
Yes. Thank you.
(applause)
WALT
I say I’m not confused about what you’ve given us in the last hour, but it is a lot to hold.
ERHARD
Yes, precisely, so listen up here. This is good. I read something to you three days ago and I want
you to hear it again. See if it occurs for you diff erently than it did then.
Here, he read again the passage from the Heidegger/Japanese dialogue in Heidegger’s On the Way to
Language.
ERHARD (reading)
“We Japanese do not think it strange if a dialogue leaves undefi ned what is really intended, or
even restores it back to the keeping of the undefi nable.” ... “That is part of every dialogue that
has turned out well among thinking beings. As if of its own accord it can take care that that
undefi nable something not only does not slip away, but displays its gathering power ever more
Stanley Kubrick’s film 2001, when he asked whether he is happy:
“I’m using all my capacities to the maximum. What more could a
rational entity want?” This, says Dreyfus, is “a brilliant expression
of what anyone would say who is in touch with our current
understanding of Being.”
Of particular relevance is Dreyfus’ observation that “the
human potential movement perfectly expresses this technological
understanding of Being” (“Gaining”). Werner Erhard’s work, which
Peter Marin has called “the logical extension of the whole human
potential movement” (“The New Narcissism,” Harper’s Magazine,
October 1975, 47), may therefore be considered as a representative
manifestation of our current technological understanding of
Being, especially to the degree that this logical extension is
itself, paradoxically, a denial of the so-called human potential
movement. This point is central to the conclusion we are moving
toward here.
The situation: humans are always subjected to understandings
of Being, and to the way they play themselves out over time. In
Dreyfus’ words, “We don’t produce the clearing; The clearing
produces us” (“Gaining”). Every historical epoch is characterized
by a particular mode of unconcealment, a particular way in which
Being shows itself, so that in each epoch humans are given a
particular way to be. Through this epochal self-revealing, this
giving of itself to humans, Being manifests its nature; and beings
show up being that way, “the way they wound up being,” as Erhard
might say more recently.
But as Western thought has evolved over time, human beings
have lost their awareness of Being, if ever they have even been
aware of Being. Now, of the giver-giving-given event that is Being’s
gift , we see only the given, and we see it only as it is represented by
beings. Being “withdraws in favor of the gift  which It gives” (OTB 8).
When a giver withdraws and holds itself back, and gives only
its gift , that giving is appropriately called sending (OTB 8). The
gift  is given, but the sender, crucially, is not present. So while an
experience of Being is no longer available, the sending continues
to shape human existence in every age. This is the process which
Heidegger calls the destining of Being, and from this destining
512
SPEAKING BEING
luminously in the course of the dialogue.” The Japanese inquirer said “Our dialogues with our
teacher failed to turn out so well. Us younger men challenged him much too directly to satisfy
our thirst for handy information.” ... “Thirst for knowledge and greed for explanations never
lead to a thinking inquiry. Curiosity is always the concealed arrogance of a self-consciousness
that banks on a self-invented rationality.”
(to the group)
You remember I told you that that means we treat anything worth knowing as something
that merely extends from what we already know and that if we don’t immediately understand
something it must be bullshit.
(continuing to read)
“The will to know does not will to abide in hope before what is worthy of thought.”
(to the group)
What you and I just spoke about in the last two hours is worth standing in front of. You may not
get it all, which means you may not understand it all, which really means you may not be able
to apply it all, and your applying it will only denigrate it anyhow. Much better to stand with it,
to be with it.
WALT
So I’m way beyond what I understood before. I’m standing on a beach ball here, ready to lose
my balance. But it’s a good place to be. I understood you to tell us that the forwarding of this is
in declaration, that declaration is the way to access this?
ERHARD
Declaration is the action out of which possibility is generated: the speech act out of which
possibility is generated; it’s the name of the speech act out of which possibility arises.
WALT
So that’s what a person can do, in doing, to work with this.
ERHARD
Yeah, to generate a possibility. Precisely.
WALT
But the possibility, this possibility that’s created, is itself not useful, or applicable, but it sounds
“opportunity” somehow gets created.
ERHARD
There’s an opening. A freedom. There’s a freedom for that which you have declared possible. It
doesn’t mean you will—it means that there’s a freedom for that which you’ve declared possible,
that your actions may arise inside that possibility, and that your actions will arise inside that
possibility. We’re not done yet. We’ve got one last step to take.
“the essence of all history is determined” (“QCT” in BW 329). Here
Dreyfus recounts the historical record:
In the Christian age, everything showed up as
God’s creation, and showed up in terms of its
nearness or distance from God’s own nature.
In the modern age, everything showed up as
either a subject with a deep essence, or an ob-
ject with fixed properties. In the technological
age, by contrast, everything shows up in light
of what will allow us to put it to “the greatest
possible use at the lowest expenditure.” (Com-
panion to Heidegger 13)
“
Heidegger refers to this historical evolution of destining as the
play of Being. Being holds itself back in a particular way in each
epoch, and it is in the progress of the epochs that the play of Being
is manifested. The order of that play defies human understanding
and control: “The sequence of epochs in the destiny of Being is not
accidental, nor can it be calculated as necessary” (OTB 9). It plays.
Therefore enframing can be seen from one perspective as the
essence of modern technology, while from another it is simply the
particular clearing for unconcealment which the play of Being has
sent at this moment in history.
At this point, the reader may notice herself thinking some
version of “So what?” Yes, we can see the eff ects of technology
in our world. We overuse our gadgets and texting while driving is
dangerous and our interpersonal eye contact is suff ering.
But at the same time global communication and the conveniences
of everyday living have improved exponentially, and marginalized
groups around the globe have found a voice through social media
that have also shaken the foundations of local, national, and world
politics. Every advance brings its challenges. We can deal with it.
Perhaps. Certainly, the advantages are undeniable. But the
threat embedded in technology’s essence may make this one
advance too far. With each development in the play of Being, we
are moving farther and farther from the possibility of an originary
experience of Being: “The epochs overlap each other in their
ERHARD (continuing to read)

WALT
Okay. I’m just trying to handle the steps I’ve taken.
ERHARD
You’re doing the right thing. Go ahead.
WALT
In the previous days here, I’ve been able to get outside of myself. The meaninglessness, and
the meaninglessness of that, was a further push out of myself. And it’s an exciting place to be
for action. I have a concern that this will just remain potential. And I want to use it as soon as
possible so that it does not remain potential, or just a memory.
ERHARD
Your actions will be consistent with it remaining a potential, and consistent with your avoiding
that.
WALT
So I will not avoid that.
ERHARD
I don’t know. I just said your actions would be consistent with the occurring you created.
WALT
Okay. So I say...
ERHARD
Relax. See, relax. All you got to do is be here. Real simple. All you got to do is be here. This stuff
works. It actually works.
WALT
But it’s too great just to let it sit.
ERHARD
No, it’s so great you’ve got to let it sit. All you’ve got to do is take a stand for anything you want
to get out of The Forum.
WALT
Yeah but me... get out of The Forum, it’s puny compared to what you’ve put on the board.
ERHARD
I didn’t say “you,” like limiting it to you, like you, individually. “One can give...” Is that better?
sequence so that the original sending of Being as presence is more
and more obscured in diff erent ways” (OTB 9).
Therefore Heidegger makes his case in the strongest
possible terms: it is not just that our technological way of being is
distancing and impersonal. It is that once we lose ourselves in the
system, we may not be able to find our way out. As the Cartesian
subject, the self-certain lord of the earth, we encountered our
subjective truth in every objective being. But enframed as
resources for technology, “precisely nowhere does man today
any longer encounter himself, i.e., his essence” (“QCT” in BW 332).
We might begin to detect in Heidegger’s discourse the hint of a
persistent complaint reaching a fever pitch:
Enframing does not simply endanger man in
his relationship to himself and to everything
that is. As a destining, it banishes man into the
kind of revealing that is an ordering. Where this
ordering holds sway, it drives out every other
possibility of revealing. [. . .]
The rule of enframing threatens man with the
possibility that it could be denied to him to en-
ter into a more original revealing and hence to
experience the call of a more primal truth. Thus
where enframing reigns, there is danger in the
highest sense. (“QCT” in BW 332–333)
“
The culmination: what has been lost is forgotten.
Enframing disguises even this, its disguising, just
as the forgetting of something forgets itself and
is drawn away in the wake of forgetful oblivion.
The coming-to-pass of oblivion not only lets fall
from remembrance into concealment; but that
falling itself falls simultaneously from remem-
brance into concealment, which itself also falls
away in that falling. (“TT” in QCT 46)

SPEAKING BEING
WALT
It is... for me.
ERHARD
You have to free yourself, not limit yourself. You want to limit yourself: That’s what you want to
do—you want to limit yourself to be sure. You don’t want to take the risk of letting yourself be
free inside the possibilities you create. You want to limit your actions to make sure you realize
your goal. That is not this course. That’s a “Success” course.
WALT
So if I’m going to stay with it here, stay on board, really...
ERHARD
Give yourself some freedom. Create the possibility and then operate out of that possibility.
Operate on what? Whatever the hell’s in front of you, do whatever you do. Stop complicating
it. You’re back in the fi rst day now. You’re asking how to proceed. You’re asking for the
prescription. You go left and then you go right, that’s how you get there; but the real way to
get there is going wherever you’re going. Do whatever you’re doing. Don’t do what you’re not
doing. It’s real easy to follow that instruction.
WALT
And that’s enough?
ERHARD
That’s enough. Who would tell a guy like you that what you need to do is to box yourself in? The
degree to which you need to be boxed in is the degree to which you need to be narrowed. You’re
going to handle that without any help from anybody. Don’t you understand, Walt, I’m not going to
tell you: “Walt, what has to happen is that the sun’s gotta come up tomorrow morning!” That’s going
to happen anyhow. You don’t need to take my time, and I don’t need to take your time to have that
discussion. You don’t need to take our time to have the discussion you want to have, you’re going to
do that anyhow. You’ll get enough of that mixed into the stew. You’ll take care of that. You’re thrown
to that.
WALT
Yeah I am.
ERHARD
Yeah, you’re thrown to that. We don’t talk about what you’re thrown to. It’s not that we don’t
need what you’re thrown to. We do, but why talk about it? We’re going to get that anyhow.
WALT
I was trying to address something else. I was trying to address what you put out there.
At this point, for Heidegger, we let slip our own essential
role as the beings with meaning, the beings for whom Being is an
issue, the clearing in the world for beings to be the beings they
are. “Being’s coming to presence needs the coming to presence
of man, in order to remain kept safe as Being. . .” (“TT” in QCT 38).
But as enframing, we forfeit our role as safekeeper. Lost in the
machinations of the cybernetic system, we not only let the truth of
Being fall into oblivion, but we let fall into oblivion the knowledge
that we have done so, until finally, oblivion itself is forgotten,
and we forget that anything has been lost. “The most profound
oblivion,” says Heidegger, “is not-recollecting” (EP 63).
As evidence that this is already the condition in our world, we
cite the diff iculty that is inevitably encountered in any discussion
of Being, for example, the recurring sense in reading this book of
“What the hell are we talking about?” Being in our time, so goes
Heidegger’s persistent complaint, cannot be recollected, let alone
spoken. ■
Forum Day Four: Session Three 515
ERHARD
You’re trying to address what I put out there using your approach. And you need a little bit of
your approach. But we don’t need to discuss that; you’ll come up with that with your genius
in that quarter. You don’t need to discuss that with me. What you need to do is create the
possibility and to let yourself be free in the possibility. All the rest of it you’re thrown to.
WALT
Okay, so create the possibility.
ERHARD
Yeah, that’s what I said. You can have anything out of The Forum you can stand for having
gotten. “Stand for having gotten” and “create the possibility” are synonymous.
WALT
And that’s the declaration.
ERHARD
Yeah. That’s: generate a conversation for.
WALT
So if I don’t screw with that, it’s going to be all right.
ERHARD
Yeah, just handle that... No, I don’t know whether it’s going to be all right. All I know is that
you’re going to have power in the face of the risk that life is. That’s all I promised you. I didn’t
promise you things would be all right. I promised you the power and ability. I don’t know about
all right.
WALT
Thanks, Werner.
ERHARD
Yes, you’re welcome.
(applause)
Bill? Stand up.
Bill stood, the participant from the chocolate/vanilla demonstration, who also confronted Erhard on
the fi rst day of The Forum concerning being pressured to be in the course.
(continuing)
It’s called equal time, Bill. It’s called “only fair.”

روز چهارم انجمن: جلسه سه 505
erhard (ادامه خنده)
این شما هستید شما "اوه گه!" اینگونه است که ما می دانیم وقتی برگشتید. (خنده ؛ نشانگر دایره خالی سوم)
بنابراین بسیاری از مواردی که نیمه دوم انجمن در مورد آن است ، دسترسی به این دامنه است. و تو و من
در حالی که به صفر می رسید ، قرار نیست کار خوبی را برای دسترسی به آن دامنه انجام دهند ، زیرا
همه شما در الاغ درد داشتید و رسیدن به صفر خیلی طولانی طول کشید. اگر من را نشنیدید
اشتباه می کنید ، من فقط شما را اشتباه می کردم. (خنده)
طرف دیگر این است که ما گله های خود را جمع نکرده ایم تا این انجمن را به صفر برسانیم
به اندازه کافی سریع برای انجام یک کار خوب در نیمه دوم. این باعث اشتباه من می شود توجه می کنید
هیچ چیز تغییر نمی کند ، مهم نیست که چه کسی اشتباه کرده است؟ (خنده و تشویق)
نکته این است که ما نمی توانیم خیلی بیشتر از باز کردن نیمه دوم انجمن انجام دهیم. این به همان اندازه است که ما می توانیم انجام دهیم ، زیرا همه شما به زیبایی زیبایی خود نیاز دارید. (خنده)
خوب ، پس این دامنه چیست؟ اگر تجربی نباشد ، و اینگونه نیست ؛ این مفهومی نیست ، و اینگونه نیست:
آن دامنه چیست؟ (نوشتن "امکان" در دایره سوم)
ساده این دامنه امکان است. نه این امکان یا این امکان
(نشانگر دایره "داستان")
... اینجا است می توانید بگویید که این امکان امکان وجود دارد. اما چنین دامنه ای وجود ندارد. مهم نیست که به کجا می روید تا به دنبال آن باشید ، نمی توانید از آن استفاده کنید. شما نمی توانید آن را داشته باشید مگر اینکه آن را اختراع کنید. شما باید امکان امکان را اختراع کنید. شما می خواهید به آن گوش دهید. مردم ندارند
امکان در زندگی آنها آنها گزینه هایی دارند. گزینه ها آتی است که از گذشته تولید می شود. در
گذشته می تواند اینگونه عمل کند ، یا می تواند اینگونه عمل کند. می دانید ، مکالمه مشترک
بین مردم اوضاع می تواند اینگونه عمل کند ، یا آنها می توانند مانند این کار کنند. "آنها هستند
به احتمال زیاد این کار را انجام می دهد ، اما اوه پسر من دوست دارم آنها را مانند این کار کنند ، اما این است
خیلی محتمل نیست. " این امکان پذیر نیست ؛ گزینه ها مفهومی هستند.
تجربه - لیست کردن - تجربه شما بیشتر به گزینه هایی که می دهید محدود خواهد شد
خودتان را تجربه کنید. این دایره شرور دوباره است. (نشانگر دایره "داستان")
گزینه ها در اینجا هستند. چرا من آنها را گزینه می نامم؟ زیرا آنها از گذشته شما گرفته شده اند
تجربیات! گزینه ها تجربه آینده شما را شکل می دهند. و تجربیات گزینه ای شکل
گزینه ها را تقویت کنید. بنابراین اکنون شما خود را از دست دادید تا نیازی به دریافت آن نباشید
صبح دیگر ، زیرا جایی برای رفتن وجود ندارد. چرا زحمت می کشید؟ شما از قبل می دانید
چگونه خواهد بود ، پس چرا زحمت می کشید؟ تنها دلیلی که بیشتر شما از خواب بلند می شوید به این دلیل است که شما
506
وجود
مثل کافی این یک مشکل روانپزشکی به نام مازوخیسم است. برای دریافت آن به روانپزشک بروید
اداره شده ما این کار را در اینجا انجام نمی دهیم. اما بیشتر شما از خواب بلند می شوید زیرا دوست دارید که کافی باشد. من
یعنی ، شما باید کافی را دوست داشته باشید: این همان کاری است که شما انجام می دهید. و می دانید که می خواهید این کار را انجام دهید. نه ،
آنچه شما را از بین می برد ، امیدوارید که این کار را انجام دهید ، به امید اینکه همه چیز به نتیجه برسد ،
به امید اینکه به این امید متفاوت باشد ، به امید اینکه بخواهید جواب دهید. این چیست؟ (در پاسخ به یک شرکت کننده که در حال تماس است ، Erhard تکرار می کند)
بله شما امیدوار هستید دقیقاً به امید اینکه شما را از بین ببرد. چرا زحمت بلند شدن
صبح اگر می دانید چگونه خواهد بود؟ (برای نشان دادن دایره "امکان" به صفحه سیاه پوست
به هر حال ، شما چیزی برای گفتن در اینجا دارید. شما در مورد تجربه چیزی برای گفتن ندارید - شما
فقط می تواند در مورد آن کم و بیش دقیق گزارش کند. (نشانگر دایره "داستان")
و شما محدود به آنچه می گویید در اینجا گزارش می دهید در مورد تجربه. این گزارش در مورد آن است. (نشانگر دایره "امکان")
در اینجا شما رایگان هستید. اکنون ، یک صید کوچک وجود دارد. یک رویای لوله امکان پذیر نیست. رویاها
و احتمال یکسان نیست. احتمال آینده است. می توانید بگویید که گذشته می توانست
احتمالاً مثل این بوده اند اما در آینده ، ممکن است یاد بگیریم که گذشته واقعاً متفاوت بود
از آنچه فکر کردیم امکان همیشه آینده است. این نوع زمانی است: آینده. وت
شما می خواهید رویاهای لوله ای داشته باشید و آنها را امکان پذیر کنید. من به شما می گویم که چگونه می توانید تفاوت را بیان کنید
بین یک رویای لوله و امکان. هیچ آینده ای وجود ندارد ، که تا به حال تحقق خواهد یافت ، یعنی
پس از وقوع گذشته ، پسوند گذشته نیست. همه آینده ها گسترش گذشته خواهد بود. در آنجا
آینده ناپیوسته ای نیست. نه در طول عمر شما ، زیرا همه آینده ها ، در صورت تحقق ، دارای یک
استمرار با گذشته. هیچ اتفاقی نیفتاده است که مغایر با آن باشد
گذشته در صورت لزوم ، گذشته بازنویسی می شود. بر اساس کلمبوس و انیشتین گذشته بود
بازنویسی شده ببینید ، این درست بود که جهان در آن قرار داشت ، تا اینکه کسی کاری مغایر با آن انجام داد
که سپس گفتیم ، اوه ، این کار نبود. چگونه جهنمی می دانید که در آن نبوده است؟ نکته این است که
شما می توانید امکاناتی را برای زندگی خود ایجاد کنید و می خواهید این امکانات را برطرف کنید
بازگرداندن امکان به زمان حال. مانند ایستادن در آینده برای ایجاد آینده. وت
سپس آن را به حال حاضر می کنید ، بنابراین ساختاری برای تحقق این امکان وجود دارد. اما این هم
فنی ، و ما وقت نداریم که امشب به همه فنی ها برویم. همه من می روم
به شما بگویید این است: اگر با امکان زندگی می کنید ، با ریسک و قدرت زندگی می کنید. هیچ یک از این کار ؛
این فقط توانمند است هیچ یک از این پاسخ ها نیست و توانمند است. زندگی به طور واقعی است
خطرناک شما ایده اشتباه در مورد زندگی گرفتید. شما فکر می کنید زندگی در مورد کاهش خطر با افزایش خطر است
پاسخ ها شما می خواهید تقلب کنید. اگر می خواهید خطر را کاهش دهید ، با بچه های سه ساله تنیس بازی کنید. شما
همیشه برنده شوید. احساس خوبی به شما می دهد. (خنده)
اگر برنده شدن در تمام مدت باعث می شود احساس خوبی داشته باشید ، دوست دارید تنیس با بچه های سه ساله بازی کنید. پیروزی باعث نمی شود مردم احساس خوبی داشته باشند. قدرتمند و توانا و بازی و رقصیدن ،
این باعث می شود مردم احساس خوبی داشته باشند. و برای انجام این کار شما باید قدرت داشته باشید ، و این همان چیزی است که ما هستیم
erhard (ادامه)
تنها چیزی که می خواهم به شما بگویم این است: اگر با آن زندگی می کنید
امکان ، شما با خطر و قدرت زندگی می کنید. هیچ یک از این کار ؛ این فقط توانمند است هیچ کدام
از این پاسخ است ، و قدرتمند است. زندگی
واقعاً خطرناک است "
روز چهارم انجمن: جلسه سه 507
صحبت در مورد اینجا: آنچه در اینجا صحبت می کنیم توانمندسازی خود است ، نه کاهش
خطر ما در مورد دادن جواب به شما صحبت نمی کنیم تا بدانید که چگونه مردم را مورد ضرب و شتم قرار دهید. من
فقط زندگی و مردم را به یک کودک سه ساله کاهش می دهد. این احمقانه است اگر این نکته به صدر رسید
کوه اورست ، برخی از کارآفرین های خدایی ، آسانسور را روی آن قرار می دهند. سوال این است: چگونه
قدرتمند و چقدر می توانید در مواجهه با خطر به نام کوه اورست باشید؟ (مکث)
خوب بنابراین ما تقریباً در خانه هستیم. ما دو مرحله دیگر را داریم. و اولین مرحله یک قدم است
مسئولیت نامید. تمرین انتخاب را به خاطر می آورید؟ شما چیزی در مورد انتخاب کشف کردید
این مغایر با تفسیری بود که قبلاً آن انتخاب را داشتید ، و وجود دارد
یک قدرت خاص برای تمایز انتخاب روشی که در طول تمرین آن را متمایز می کنید. یکسان
چیز در مورد مسئولیت اولین چیزی که می خواهید بدست آورید این است که مسئولیت سرزنش یا گناه نیست
یا تقصیر وقتی می گویم مسئولیت پذیر هستم ، نمی گویم که این کار را کردم ، یا مقصر هستم یا اینکه مقصر هستم. وقتی می گویم مسئولیت پذیر هستم ، منظور من این است که من در این موضوع هستم. نه "من
باعث شد. " این یک موضع گیری در این ماده است (نشانگر دایره "امکان")
و شما نمی توانید بدون این دامنه موضع بگیرید. بدون این دامنه ، موضع شما صرفاً است
موقعیت موقعیتی که شما در مورد این موضوع گرفته اید. من نمی دانم که آیا شما این را تماشا کرده اید
طی چهار روز گذشته ، اما موقعیت های شما شما را به آب گرم زیادی تبدیل کرده است. مواضع شما
زندگی خود را کمی خراب کرده اید. یا کل (مکث)
بدون این دامنه ... ببینید ، با ایستادن برای چیزی به عنوان یک امکان وجود دارد
امکان با تنظیم چیزی به عنوان چیزی که شما در آن قرار دارد ، موقعیتی ایجاد می شود
کار می کنند امکان چیزی است که شما می توانید آن را تحقق بخشید ، که متفاوت از چیزی است
شما در حال کار هستید به نظر می رسد که شما می توانید هر آنچه را که می خواهید بایستید متوجه شوید
برای این با کار کردن به سمت چیزی متفاوت است. آیا می توانید تصور کنید: کار به سمت ضربه زدن
توپ روی تور تنیس تنیس خوبی ایجاد نمی کند؟ یا کار به سمت رقصیدن. من
مادر فقط در بزرگ کردن من یک اشتباه کرد. او مرا به باشگاه زنان Bala Cynwyd فرستاد تا
رقصیدن را یاد بگیرید. این یک اشتباه بزرگ بود. (خنده)
دانستن اینکه پاهای خود را کجا قرار دهید رقص نیست. من مدت طولانی این را نمی دانستم. (نشانگر دایره "امکان")
عمل در این قلمرو اعلامیه است. (نشانگر دایره "داستان")
عمل در این قلمرو ادعا است. (نشانگر دایره "چه اتفاقی افتاده است")
عمل در اینجا بیانگر است. این اقدامات گفتاری است ، اما این بسیار پیچیده خواهد بود. به
اعلامیه را درک کنید ، شما باید به یک کنوانسیون Umpire بروید. ببینید ، با استفاده از a امکان ایجاد می شود
برای چیزی به عنوان یک امکان بایستید. یک موقعیت
با تنظیم چیزی به عنوان برخی-
چیزی که در آن کار می کنید. احتمال
این چیزی است که شما می توانید آن را تحقق بخشید ، که
متفاوت از چیزی است که شما کار می کنید
به سمت مثل این است که شما می توانید Whatev را تحقق بخشید-
این است که شما مایل به ایستادن هستید. یعنی
از کار به سمت چیزی متفاوت است. "

وجود
در اینجا Erhard داستان را در مورد سه Umpires گفت: The Rookie Umpire که گفت "او را مانند صدا می کند
آنها هستند ، "ناظر باتجربه ای که گفت او آنها را" مثل من می بینم "و استاد مأموریت ،"
چه کسی گفت: "آنها چیزی نیستند تا زمانی که من به آنها چیزی بنامم."
درز
این اعلامیه است ببینید ، Umpire قدرت اعلامیه را بدست آورد. چیه؟ اگر رئیس جمهور کارتر
در نیمه شب از خواب بیدار می شود ، می گوید: "به جهنم با گلاسنوست ، من بمب ها را بیرون می آورم".
روزالین چه می گوید؟ "خفه شو ، جیمی ، بخواب." اما اگر رئیس جمهور بوش این کار را کرد ، باربارا
برای پناهگاه بمب می رود. در واقع ، رئیس جمهور این کار را نمی کند ، اما هرگز به آن توجه نکنید. آن را خراب می کند
اگر من وارد آن شوم. این قدرت اعلامیه: این همان چیزی است که مسئولیت پذیر است ، زیرا
مسئولیت پذیری صرفاً اعلامیه است. این اعلامیه ای است که فرد در این موضوع ایجاد می شود. این است
توضیحی در مورد پرونده نیست. این گزارشی از واقعیت ها نیست: این مکانی برای ایستادن در زندگی است
آنچه به شما اهمیت می دهید وقتی من در هند هستم ، می گویم افرادی که گرسنه هستند مسئولیت آن را بر عهده دارند
گرسنگی آنها و قلب های خونریزی با آن مشکلی دارند. اما من به شما خواهم گفت ، اگر شما هستید
مسئول گرسنگی شما بسیار قدرتمندتر از آن هستید که قربانی گرسنگی شوید. برای من کاملاً واضح است که گرسنه ها نمی خواهند گرسنه باشند ، و گرسنه ها این کار را نمی کنند
اگر آنها فرصتی برای انجام کاری در مورد آن داشتند ، از این طریق داشته باشید. برای من کاملاً واضح است که
زندگی یک روز در آنجا شجاعت بیشتر از آنچه برای من طول می کشد تا ده سال طول بکشد. اما درمان
مردم به طوری که انگار هیچ مسئولیتی ندارند ، از مردم ناامید کننده است. اکنون شما نمی توانید استدلال کنید
شما مسئول هستید ، زیرا این یک اعلامیه نیست ، اینطور است؟ این یک ادعا است ، یک استدلال. بوها
اعلامیه باید آزادانه انجام شود ، نه اجبار. شما باید قدرت اعلامیه را داشته باشید ، و
قدرت اعلامیه محصول آزادی است. این یک امتیاز است که مسئولیت داشته باشید ، نه یک بار
مسئول بودن "من در موضوع هستم" موضعی برای قدرت دادن به خود است ، نه گزارشی
در مورد حقایق یا شرایط برای من روشن است که من علت موضوع مردم هستم
گرسنگی من آن اعلامیه را بیان می کنم ؛ با توجه به مسئله گرسنگی به من قدرت می دهد. این یک نیست
گزارش این واقعیت که من این کار را کردم. این مکانی برای ایستادن است که از آن قدرت دارد. اگر تقصیر من نیست ،
اگر من این کار را نکردم - اما هیچکدام از اینها به من علاقه ای ندارند - این تقصیر است؟ کسی اشتباه می کند
و کسی درست می شود. این نکته است (نشانگر دایره "امکان")
قلمرو امکان نیز قلمرو مسئولیت است. بیشتر مردم هرگز قرار نمی گیرند
مسئولیت پذیر است زیرا این قلمرو وجود ندارد. شما باید آن را اختراع کنید. یکی از مواردی که ما نداریم
به شما گفت چیزی است که می خواهید از حضور در انجمن خارج شوید. گوش کن آنچه می خواهید
از انجمن خارج شوید - بله ، شما می خواهید چیزهای خوب و چیزهای خوبی را بدست آورید ، اما این است
همه گه مرغ آنچه شما واقعاً می خواهید از انجمن خارج شوید ، هر کاری است که شما مایل هستید
ایستادگی کنید تا از انجمن خارج شوید. شما نمی خواهید از انجمن خارج شوید
به شما داد زیرا ما نمی توانیم به شما چیزی ارزشمند بدهیم. می دانید ، همه این افراد اینجا نیستند
زیرا ما چیز ارزشمندی برای دادن به مردم داریم. شما نمی توانید از هر چیز ارزشمندی دریافت کنید
افراد دیگر مانند "به آن داده شود." گه مرغ همان چیزی است که ما از یکدیگر می گیریم. اما می توانید بدهید
خودتان چیزی ارزشمند است. شما می توانید به خودتان چیزی فوق العاده ارزشمند بدهید. شما
می توانید به خودتان چیزی بدهید که بقیه عمر شما دوام داشته باشد. شما می توانید به خودتان چیزی بدهید
این امر باعث می شود که زندگی شما هرگز یکسان نباشد. بنابراین این قول من است: من قول می دهم که می توانید
هر چیزی را در خارج از انجمن داشته باشید که مایل به ایستادن در آن هستید. من هم به شما قول می دهم
آنچه واقعاً می خواهید از آن خارج شوید
انجمن هر چیزی است که شما مایل به تحمل آن هستید
خارج از انجمن. "
روز چهارم انجمن: جلسه سه 509
چیز دیگری را از انجمن که ارزش هر چیزی را ندارد ، دریافت نخواهید کرد. آنچه از خود خارج خواهید شد
مشارکت در انجمن همان چیزی است که شما مایل به ایستادن به آن هستید. شما نمی گیرید
چه چیزی را بررسی می کنید تا ببینید که آیا دریافت کرده اید ... "بگذارید ببینم چه اتفاقی برای من افتاده است؟ ذهن من
تغییر؟ آیا احساسات من تغییر کرده است؟ آیا بینایی من تغییر کرده است؟ قد بلندتر هستم؟ آیا من نازک تر هستم؟ آیا من
احساس بهتری دارید؟ " اگر مایل به قدرتمند شدن باشید ، نمی توانید هیچ یک از این موارد را داشته باشید.
در اینجا ، می توانید از اینجا توانمند شوید. این حقیقت است این برخی از تله های هوایی نیست. شما اولین افرادی نیستید که من این کار را با آنها انجام داده ام. این بر اساس شواهد زیادی است. شما 625 دلار پرداخت کرده اید. شما چهار روز الاغ خود را غوطه ور می کنید ، هنوز یک شب برای رفتن. هر چیز دیگری
این امکان را دارید که بخواهید از آن بایستید ، هر مکالمه ای را که می خواهید داشته باشید
تولید کنید ، این همان چیزی است که شما بدست آورده اید. هر امکان که مایل به تحمل آن هستید ، این است
آنچه می توانید داشته باشید کاری که در اینجا انجام داده اید به شما این قدرت را داده است که بتوانید آنچه را که هستید تحقق بخشید
مایل به ایستادن ، نه مانند یک فرمول ، بلکه مانند فرصتی است که می توانید در آن عمل کنید و باشید. نه
مانند یک نتیجه تضمین شده ، نه مانند بازی تنیس با یک کودک سه ساله. کاملاً در معرض خطر است ، اما
در مقابل خطر کاملاً توانمند است. اگر خطر را دوست ندارید ، زندگی را دوست ندارید. بنابراین ما هستیم
اکنون تا آخرین چیز نوع من می گویم نوعی چون هرگز نمی دانم واقعاً آخرین چیست. چه کسی
سوالی دارید؟ یک شرکت کننده دست خود را بلند کرد. ریچارد
من آنچه را که پولم را پرداخت کردم دریافت کردم. آنچه در چند ماه گذشته اتفاق افتاده است این است که پروژه های من
آنقدر موفق شده اند که آنها بزرگتر از احتمال من برای آنها هستند. درز
شما می شنوید که او چه گفت؟ او از دنیای امکان استفاده کرد. محتوا غرق شده است
متن او یک امکان ایجاد کرده است و به اندازه کافی با آن امکان ارتباط برقرار کرده است ،
با قدرت تحقق این امکان به گونه ای که محتوا زمینه را تحت الشعاع قرار دهد. می دانید قهرمان چیست؟ نه آنچه شما فکر می کنید یک قهرمان است. یک قهرمان برخی از دلهره ها نیست ،
شخص خارق العاده فقط افراد عادی می توانند قهرمان شوند. یک قهرمان یک فرد معمولی است که
جرات دارد فراخوان یک امکان بزرگتر از خود را بشناسد و بپذیرد. واقعی ساده یک قهرمان یک فرد معمولی است که می بیند ، می شنود ، که برای آن باز است ، و تماس یک را می پذیرد
احتمال بزرگتر از خود ، یا خودش یا خودش. سسیلیا
من کارهای زیادی انجام داده ام و یک هنرمند و تصویرگر هستم. من انتشارات کتاب را انجام داده ام ، و به همین ترتیب همه
این کار حداقل شصت درصد انفرادی است ، و من سالهاست که این مکالمه را انجام داده ام
من باید با افراد دیگر شرکت کنم. و بنابراین یک بار و مدتی می روم این کار را از "باید انجام دهم
به. " من کارهای خوبی انجام داده ام اما در پایان می گویم "جیز! این یک اشتباه بود کاش انجام داده بودم
این به خودم پس از همه. " منظورم این است که پرورش در اینجا بسیار افتضاح است و من این کار را انجام داده ام
سالها کار کنید و از آن خارج شوید. و آنچه که من این چهار روز گذشته را دریافت کردم این بود که این بود
اگر فکر می کنم باید بروم و این کار را انجام دهم ، هرگز به کار خود ادامه نمی دهم. مثل "Gee ، من این چیز را دوست دارم
انجام: نقاشی. این بی معنی است ، بنابراین من فقط این کار را خواهم کرد! " اما من هم دریافتم که یکی از آنها را کشته ام
ویژگی های اصلی انسانی ، که عشق بود. 510

سسیلیا (ادامه ؛ شکستن اشک)
کاری که اکنون می توانم انجام دهم این است که بیرون بروم و با همه شما از عشق من به همه شما باشم ، نه به این دلیل که من

خیلی خوب (تشویق)
هانری
من صحبت می کنم و گوش می دهم و مثل اولین بار است. من لک زده ام و این اولین بار است
که من نیستم من به پدرم و مادرم زنگ زدم. من به آنها گفتم که آنها را دوست دارم و آنها به من گفتند
آنها مرا دوست داشتند. من به آنها گفتم که آنها توسط من خوب هستند. پدر من گفت ، "خوب این جالب است!" من
از او پرسید که آیا من از او خوب هستم و او گفت "مطمئناً شما توسط من خوب هستید." روابط من با من
مادر و پدر کامل هستند. من این را می گویم درز
به هر حال: اگر چنین بگویید آنها هستند. نه مثل اینکه می خواهید چنین بگویید. شما باید آزاد باشید که چنین بگویید. شما نمی توانید این حرف را به صورت سفارش دهید. شما باید ایستاده باشید که آنچه می گویید چنین است. ما در مورد صحبت خواهیم کرد
در یک لحظه لطفا ادامه دهید هانری
هر آنچه که من در سی و دو سال از زندگی ام به دست آورده ام خالی و بی معنی است. من هستم
خوب با آن زندگی من عالی است. آنچه در چند روز گذشته برای من اتفاق افتاده است ... من ایستاده ام
در اینجا لرزش و احترام و قدردانی از فضای باورنکردنی گوش دادن به شما لرزید
ایجاد شده من خودم را برای اولین بار بیان می کنم. بخش هایی از انجمن که فرقه متفاوتی بوده اند
برای من - من در حال گذراندن انجمن هستم و فکر می کنم تنها کسی هستم که این کار را می کنم. اما من
خودم را در سهم همه دیده ام و فرقه یا دردناک نبوده است. عالی بود من شده ام
آن: درد کمر من از بین رفته است ، مواد بینی y از بین رفته است. من فراتر از فرد کودک هستم. من این بودم که "من
نمی توانم فراتر از سال گذشته به یاد بیاورم. " من نمی دانم که آیا به یاد می آورم چه اتفاقی افتاده است
یا به یاد آوردن داستان ، اما من به یاد داشته باشم که چه زمانی بسیار جوان بودم. و چه
برای من آزاد می شود: من نمی توانستم آنچه را که برای من نامرئی بود ، داشته باشم. راکت ، که ناشی از حوادث است
که برای من نامرئی بود و از من مسدود شد ، ادامه می یافت و حوادث چنین بود
خیلی زود ، زودتر از آنچه که قبلاً نگاه کردم. حتی اگر من قبلاً آموزش را انجام داده ام ، من
هرگز آنچه را که الان دارم تجربه نکرده ام. من همیشه به اشتراک گذاشته ام تا خوب به نظر برسم ، و اکنون با آنها به اشتراک می گذارم
مشارکت احساس می کنم مدت زمانی که مردم به من گوش می دهند بسیار کوتاه است ، بنابراین من صحبت می کنم
سریع ، همه چیز را وارد کنید و هیچ کس آن را دریافت نمی کند. و من بعد از آن بدتر هستم. این یک سفارش بود. درز
به جای اینکه در مورد آن صحبت کنید ، بگویید چه چیزی وجود دارد. من نگفتم ، "سریع آن را بگو" ، گفتم "بگو آنجا چیست."
شما ممکن است قبلاً آنچه را که ایستاده اید گفته باشید ، این است که "من شما را دوست دارم. و من به شما احترام می گذارم. و من شما را تصدیق می کنم." اگر چیزی فراتر از آن برای گفتن دارید ، آن را بگویید. اما به پانچ برسید
خط اگر می خواهید صحبت کنید ، این کار را به صورت مؤثر انجام دهید. فراموشی فراموشی
همانطور که قبلاً بیان کردیم ، دیدگاه هایدگر در مورد فناوری یک است
عنصر مهم در درک کار ورنر ارهارد
که ما در اینجا در حال توسعه هستیم. Dreyfus خلاصه مفیدی از
این دیدگاه در پاسخ HAL ، رایانه/ربات در
روز چهارم انجمن: جلسه سه 511

قول من این است که راکت بیست و یک سال که من زندگی کرده ام-من این کار را می کنم و اکنون هستم
زندگی از سلامت اکولوژیکی تمایز. من از شما بسیار قدردانی می کنم ، و همه شما را دوست دارم. درز
خوب خوب ممنون زلدا
منظورت چیست: ایستادن؟ درز
اعلام احتمال ... ؛ از امکان ... ؛ به عنوان زمینه زندگی ،
امکان ... مکالمه برای ... زمینه ای برای ... Zelda ایجاد کنید
من این را درک می کنم به من می گوید سخاوتمند بودن. درز
من از شما نمی خواهم سخاوتمند باشید. اگر این کار را انجام دهید سخاوتمند خواهید بود. من از شما نمی خواهم که باشید
سخاوتمندانه ، زیرا این به معنای این است که شما در درون خود کیفیتی داشته باشید که سخاوتمندانه است. اگر برای داشتن هر چیزی در خارج از انجمن ، در خارج از انجمن عمل می کنید ، مایل به ایستادگی در اختیار دارید
بدست آمده ... اگر در حالت خاموش عمل کنید سخاوتمند خواهید بود. سخاوت در یک عمل وجود دارد. این یک ملک در داخل افراد نیست که در اقدامات آنها بیان می شود. شما آن را دریافت می کنید؟ زلدا
بله ممنون (تشویق)
ورم
من می گویم من در مورد آنچه شما در آخرین ساعت به ما داده اید گیج نشده ام ، اما نگه داشتن آن بسیار زیاد است. درز
بله ، دقیقاً ، بنابراین به اینجا گوش دهید. این خوب است من سه روز پیش برای شما چیزی خواندم و می خواهم
شما دوباره آن را می شنوید. ببینید که آیا این اتفاق برای شما متفاوت است از آنچه در آن زمان انجام شده است یا خیر. در اینجا ، او دوباره متن را از گفتگوی هایدگر/ژاپنی در هایدگر در راه خواند
زبان erhard (خواندن)
"ما ژاپنی ها فکر نمی کنیم عجیب باشد اگر گفتگوی آنچه را که واقعاً در نظر گرفته شده است ، از بین ببرد.
حتی آن را به نگه داشتن Undefi Nable بازگرداند. " ... "این بخشی از هر گفتگو است که
در بین موجودات تفکر خوب شده است. گویی از توافق خود می تواند مراقبت کند
undefi nable چیزی نه تنها از بین نمی رود ، بلکه قدرت جمع آوری آن را بیشتر نشان می دهد

"من از تمام ظرفیت هایم حداکثر استفاده می کنم. چه چیزی بیشتر می تواند

سخنان Dreyfus ، "ما پاکسازی را تولید نمی کنیم ؛ پاکسازی
ما را تولید می کند "(" به دست آوردن "). هر دوره تاریخی مشخص می شود
با یک حالت خاص از عدم پذیرش ، روشی خاص که در آن
خود نشان می دهد ، به طوری که در هر دوره به انسان داده می شود
روش خاصی برای بودن از طریق این خودآزمایی دوره ، این
دادن خود به انسان ، ماهیت خود را تجلی می بخشد. و موجودات
به این ترتیب ظاهر شوید ، "راهی که آنها به وجود می آیند" ، به عنوان erhard
ممکن است اخیراً بگوید اما همانطور که اندیشه غربی با گذشت زمان تکامل یافته است ، انسانها
آگاهی خود را نسبت به بودن از دست داده اند ، اگر حتی چنین بوده اند
از وجود آگاه است. اکنون ، از رویداد هدیه دهنده ای که در حال حاضر است
هدیه ، ما فقط داده ها را می بینیم ، و فقط آن را می بینیم که توسط آن نشان داده شده است
موجودات "عقب نشینی به نفع هدیه ای که می دهد" (OTB 8). هنگامی که یک اهدا کننده عقب می رود و خود را عقب نگه می دارد ، و فقط می دهد
هدیه آن ، که دادن مناسب به نام ارسال (OTB 8) است. در
هدیه داده می شود ، اما فرستنده ، از نظر مهم ، وجود ندارد. بنابراین در حالی که
تجربه وجود دیگر در دسترس نیست ، ارسال ادامه می یابد
برای شکل دادن به وجود انسان در هر سنی. این فرایندی است که
هایدگر به عنوان سر و صدایی از هستی و از این مقصد می نامد

در جریان گفتگو با درخشش. " پرس و جو ژاپنی گفت: "گفتگوهای ما با ما
معلم نتوانست خیلی خوب ظاهر شود. ما مردان جوانتر او را بیش از حد مستقیماً برای رضایت به چالش کشیدیم
عطش ما برای اطلاعات مفید. " ... "عطش دانش و حرص و آز برای توضیحات هرگز
منجر به یک تحقیق تفکر شود. کنجکاوی همیشه استکبار پنهان یک خودآگاهی است
این بانک ها از عقلانیت خودآگاه. "
(به گروه)
شما به یاد می آورید من به شما گفتم که این بدان معنی است که ما با هر چیزی که ارزش دانستن آن را داشته باشد رفتار می کنیم
این صرفاً از آنچه ما قبلاً می دانیم گسترش می یابد و اگر فوراً درک نکنیم
چیزی که باید گلوله باشد. (ادامه خواندن)
"اراده برای دانستن ، پیش از آنچه که شایسته اندیشه است ، به امید پیروی نمی کند."
(به گروه)
آنچه شما و من فقط در دو ساعت گذشته در مورد آن صحبت کردیم ، ارزش ایستادن در مقابل دارد. شما ممکن است نباشید
این همه را بدست آورید ، این بدان معنی است که شما ممکن است همه آن را درک نکنید ، که واقعاً به این معنی است که ممکن است قادر نباشید
برای استفاده از همه ، و استفاده از آن فقط به هر حال آن را نادیده می گیرد. خیلی بهتر است که با آن بایستید ،
با آن بودن ورم
بنابراین من فراتر از آنچه قبلاً فهمیدم. من اینجا روی یک توپ ساحلی ایستاده ام ، آماده از دست دادن
تعادل من اما مکان خوبی برای بودن است. من شما را فهمیدم که به ما بگویید که حمل و نقل این است
در بیانیه ، این اعلامیه راهی برای دسترسی به این امر است؟ درز
اعلامیه عملی است که از آن امکان ایجاد می شود: گفتار که از آن استفاده می شود
امکان ایجاد می شود. این نام قانون گفتار است که از آن احتمال بوجود می آید. ورم
بنابراین این کاری است که یک شخص می تواند در انجام آن انجام دهد تا با این کار کار کند. درز
بله ، برای ایجاد یک امکان. دقیقاً ورم
اما این احتمال ، این امکان که ایجاد شده است ، خود مفید یا کاربردی نیست ، اما به نظر می رسد
"فرصت" به نوعی ایجاد می شود. درز
یک دهانه وجود دارد یک آزادی آزادی برای آنچه شما اعلام کرده اید وجود دارد. من
به این معنی نیست که شما این کار را خواهید کرد - این بدان معنی است که آزادی برای آنچه که شما اعلام کرده اید وجود دارد ،
که ممکن است اقدامات شما در این امکان بوجود بیاید و اقدامات شما در آن بوجود بیاید
امکان ما هنوز تمام نشده ایم ما یک قدم آخر را برای برداشتن داریم. "جوهر تمام تاریخ مشخص شده است" ("QCT" در BW 329). در اینجا
Dreyfus از سابقه تاریخی بازگو می کند:
در عصر مسیحیان ، همه چیز به عنوان ظاهر شد
آفرینش خدا ، و از نظر آن ظاهر شد
نزدیکی یا فاصله از طبیعت خود خدا. در عصر مدرن ، همه چیز به عنوان ظاهر شد
یا موضوعی با ذات عمیق ، یا
با خواص ثابت. در فن آوری
در عوض ، سن ، همه چیز در نور نشان داده می شود
از آنچه به ما امکان می دهد آن را به "بزرگترین
استفاده احتمالی در کمترین هزینه. " (com-
Panion to Heidegger 13)
"
هایدگر به این تکامل تاریخی سرنوشت به عنوان
بازی بودن بودن خود را به روشی خاص در هر یک نگه می دارد
دوره ، و این در حال پیشرفت دوره ها است که بازی بودن
آشکار می شود ترتیب آن نمایشنامه از درک انسان مخالف است
و کنترل: "دنباله دوره ها در سرنوشت وجود نیست
تصادفی ، و همچنین نمی توان آن را در صورت لزوم محاسبه کرد. »(OTB 9)
جوهر فناوری مدرن ، در حالی که از دیگری به سادگی است
پاکسازی خاص برای عدم وجود بازی که بازی وجود دارد
در این لحظه در تاریخ ارسال شده است. در این مرحله ، خواننده ممکن است متوجه برخی از فکر برخی شود
نسخه "پس چه؟" بله ، ما می توانیم اثرات فناوری را ببینیم
در دنیای ما ما از وسایل خود استفاده می کنیم و هنگام رانندگی پیامک می کنیم
خطرناک و تماس چشمی بین فردی ما بسیار زیاد است. اما در عین حال ارتباطات جهانی و راحتی
زندگی روزمره به صورت تصاعدی بهبود یافته و به حاشیه رانده شده است
گروه های سراسر جهان از طریق رسانه های اجتماعی صدا پیدا کرده اند
که پایه های محلی ، ملی و جهان را نیز متزلزل کرده است
سیاست هر پیشرفتی چالش های خود را به وجود می آورد. ما می توانیم با آن مقابله کنیم. شاید. مطمئناً مزایای آن غیرقابل انکار است. اما
تهدید تعبیه شده در ذات فناوری ممکن است این مسئله را ایجاد کند
بیش از حد دور با هر پیشرفت در بازی هستی ، ما
دورتر و دورتر از احتمال یک اصل در حال حرکت هستند

روز چهارم انجمن: جلسه سه 513
ورم
خوب من فقط سعی می کنم مراحلی را که انجام داده ام انجام دهم. درز
شما کار درستی را انجام می دهید. برو جلو ورم
در روزهای قبل در اینجا ، من توانسته ام از خودم خارج شوم. بی معنی بودن ، و
بی معنی بودن آن ، فشار بیشتری از خودم بود. و این یک مکان هیجان انگیز است
برای عمل من این نگرانی را دارم که این امر فقط بالقوه باقی خواهد ماند. و من می خواهم به محض استفاده از آن
ممکن است به گونه ای که پتانسیل باقی نماند ، یا فقط یک حافظه باشد. درز
اقدامات شما مطابق با باقی ماندن یک پتانسیل است و با اجتناب شما سازگار است
که ورم
بنابراین من از این امر جلوگیری نمی کنم. درز
من نمی دانم من فقط گفتم اقدامات شما مطابق با اتفاقاتی است که شما ایجاد کرده اید. ورم
خوب بنابراین من می گویم ... erhard
آرامش ببینید ، آرام باشید. تمام کاری که شما باید انجام دهید این است که اینجا باشید. واقعی ساده تمام کاری که شما باید انجام دهید این است که اینجا باشید. این چیزها
کار می کند. در واقع کار می کند. ورم
اما این خیلی عالی است که اجازه دهید بنشینید. درز
نه ، خیلی عالی است که باید اجازه دهید بنشینید. تنها کاری که باید انجام دهید این است که برای هر کاری که می خواهید موضع بگیرید
برای خارج شدن از انجمن. ورم
بله ، اما من ... از انجمن خارج شوید ، در مقایسه با آنچه در هیئت مدیره قرار داده اید ، خسته کننده است. درز
من نگفتم "شما" ، مثل محدود کردن آن برای شما ، مانند شما ، به صورت جداگانه. "کسی می تواند بدهد ..." آیا این بهتر است؟ توالی به طوری که ارسال اصلی حضور به عنوان حضور بیشتر است
و به روشهای متفاوتی مبهم تر است. »(OTB 9). بنابراین هایدگر پرونده خود را در قوی ترین مطرح می کند
اصطلاحات احتمالی: این فقط این نیست که شیوه فن آوری ما وجود دارد
فاصله و غیر شخصی. این است که یک بار خودمان را در
سیستم ، ما ممکن است نتوانیم راه خود را پیدا کنیم. به عنوان دکارتی
موضوع ، پروردگار خودکشی زمین ، ما با ما روبرو شدیم
حقیقت ذهنی در هر موجود عینی. اما به عنوان
منابع برای فناوری ، "دقیقاً امروز هیچ جا انسان نیست
دیگر با خود روبرو می شود ، یعنی ذات او "(" QCT "در BW 332)
شکایت مداوم در رسیدن به یک تب:
Enframing به سادگی انسان را به خطر نمی اندازد
رابطه او با خودش و با همه چیز
یعنی به عنوان یک مقدر ، انسان را به درون
نوع آشکار کردن که یک سفارش است. جایی که این
سفارش نگه داشتن ، هر چیز دیگری را بیرون می کشد
امکان آشکار کردن. [ بشر .]
قاعده انسداد انسان را با آن تهدید می کند
این احتمال وجود دارد که می توان آن را انکار کرد
به یک آشکار تر و از این رو
فراخوان یک حقیقت اولیه تر را تجربه کنید. بدین ترتیب
جایی که Enframing سلطنت می کند ، خطر در آن وجود دارد
بالاترین حس ("QCT" در BW 332-333)
"
اوج: آنچه گم شده است فراموش می شود. Enframing مبدل حتی این ، مبدل آن ، فقط
همانطور که فراموش کردن چیزی خودش را فراموش می کند و
در پی فراموشی فراموشی از بین می رود. بازگشت به فراموشی نه تنها اجازه سقوط می دهد
از یادآوری به پنهانکاری ؛ اما این
سقوط خود به طور همزمان از یادگار می رود-
برانت به پنهانکاری ، که خود نیز سقوط می کند
دور در آن سقوط. ("TT" در QCT 46)

ورم
این برای من است. درز
شما باید خود را آزاد کنید ، نه خود را محدود کنید. شما می خواهید خود را محدود کنید: این همان چیزی است که شما می خواهید
انجام دهید - می خواهید خود را محدود کنید تا مطمئن باشید. شما نمی خواهید خطر خود را به خود اختصاص دهید
در امکاناتی که ایجاد می کنید رایگان است. شما می خواهید اقدامات خود را محدود کنید تا مطمئن شوید که متوجه شده اید
هدف شما این دوره نیست. این یک دوره "موفقیت" است. ورم
بنابراین اگر من می خواهم در اینجا با آن بمانم ، در هیئت مدیره بمانم ، واقعاً ... erhard
به خودتان آزادی بدهید. این امکان را ایجاد کنید و سپس از این امکان کار کنید. روی چه چیزی کار کنید؟ هر چه جهنمی در مقابل شما باشد ، هر کاری که می کنید انجام دهید. پیچیده را متوقف کنید
آن شما اکنون در اولین روز بازگشتید. شما می پرسید که چگونه ادامه دهید. شما درخواست می کنید
نسخه شما به سمت چپ می روید و سپس به سمت راست می روید ، اینگونه است که به آنجا می روید. اما راه واقعی برای
به آنجا بروید هر کجا که می روید. هر کاری که می کنید انجام دهید. آنچه را که نیستید انجام ندهید
انجام پیروی از این دستورالعمل بسیار آسان است. ورم
و این کافی است؟ درز
این کافی است چه کسی به پسری مثل شما می گوید که کاری که باید انجام دهید این است که خود را وارد کنید؟ در
درجه ای که شما باید در آن جعبه شوید ، درجه ای است که شما نیاز به تنگ شدن دارید. شما
رفتن به این کار بدون هیچ گونه کمک از کسی. نمی فهمید ، والت ، من نمی خواهم
به شما بگویید: "والت ، آنچه باید اتفاق بیفتد این است که فردا صبح باید خورشید بیاید!" این می رود
به هر حال اتفاق بیفتد شما نیازی به وقت من ندارید ، و من لازم نیست که وقت خود را برای داشتن آن اختصاص دهم
بحث لازم نیست وقت خود را برای بحث و گفتگو مورد نظر خود بگذرانید ، می خواهید
به هر حال این کار را انجام دهید شما به اندازه کافی از آن مخلوط شده در خورش خواهید شد. شما از آن مراقبت خواهید کرد. شما پرتاب شده اید
به آن ورم
بله من هستم درز
بله ، شما به آن پرتاب شده اید. ما در مورد آنچه شما به آن انداخته اید صحبت نمی کنیم. این طور نیست که ما این کار را نمی کنیم
به آنچه به آن پرتاب شده اید نیاز دارید. ما انجام می دهیم ، اما چرا در مورد آن صحبت می کنیم؟ ما به هر حال می خواهیم این کار را بدست آوریم. ورم
من سعی می کردم به چیز دیگری بپردازم. من در تلاش بودم تا آنچه را که در آنجا قرار داده اید بپردازم. در این مرحله ، برای هایدگر ، ما اجازه می دهیم که خودمان را ضروری کنیم
نقش به عنوان موجودات با معنا ، موجوداتی که برای آنها وجود دارد
مسئله ، پاکسازی در جهان برای موجودات موجوداتی است
هستند "حضور در حضور نیاز به حضور دارد
از انسان ، برای اینکه به عنوان موجودی ایمن بمانیم. بشر . " ("TT" در QCT 38).
ماشینهای سیستم سایبرنتیک ، ما نه تنها حقیقت را می گذاریم
در فراموشی بودن قرار می گیریم ، اما ما اجازه می دهیم که دانش را فراموش کنیم
که ما این کار را کرده ایم ، تا اینکه سرانجام ، فراموشی فراموش می شود ،
و فراموش می کنیم که هر چیزی از بین رفته است. "عمیق ترین
Heidegger می گوید: "Oblivion ،" در حال بررسی نیست "(قسمت 63)
تفاوت هایی را که به ناچار در هر بحثی با آن روبرو می شود ، استناد کنید
به عنوان مثال بودن ، حس مکرر در خواندن این کتاب
"ما در مورد چه جهنمی صحبت می کنیم؟" در زمان ما بودن ، بنابراین می رود
شکایت مداوم هایدگر ، چه رسد به یادآوری
گفتار ■
روز چهارم انجمن: جلسه سه 515
درز
شما سعی می کنید با استفاده از رویکرد خود به آنچه در آنجا قرار داده ام بپردازید. و شما به کمی نیاز دارید
رویکرد شما اما ما نیازی به بحث در مورد آن نداریم ؛ شما با نبوغ خود به آن خواهید رسید
در آن چهارم نیازی نیست که با من در مورد آن بحث کنید. کاری که شما باید انجام دهید این است که ایجاد کنید
امکان و اجازه دادن به خودتان در این امکان آزاد است. بقیه آن را که به آن پرتاب شده اید. ورم
خوب ، بنابراین این امکان را ایجاد کنید. درز
بله ، این همان چیزی است که من گفتم. شما می توانید هر چیزی را در خارج از انجمن داشته باشید که می توانید از آن استفاده کنید
بدست آمده "ایستادن برای بدست آوردن" و "ایجاد امکان" مترادف هستند. ورم
و این اعلامیه است درز
بله این است: مکالمه ای برای. ورم
بنابراین اگر من با آن پیچ نمی کنم ، درست خواهد بود. درز
بله ، فقط این کار را انجام دهید ... نه ، من نمی دانم که آیا این درست خواهد بود. تنها چیزی که می دانم این است
شما در مواجهه با خطر زندگی ، قدرت خواهید داشت. این تنها چیزی است که من به شما قول داده ام. من این کار را نکردم
به شما قول می دهد همه چیز درست خواهد بود. من به شما قول قدرت و توانایی را کردم. من نمی دانم
خوب ورم
با تشکر ، ورنر. درز
بله ، شما خوش آمدید. (تشویق)
صورتحساب؟ بایستید بیل ایستاد ، شرکت کننده از تظاهرات شکلات/وانیل ، که همچنین با Erhard روبرو شد
روز اول انجمن در مورد فشار برای حضور در این دوره. (ادامه)
این زمان برابر است ، بیل. این "فقط عادلانه" نامیده می شود.
