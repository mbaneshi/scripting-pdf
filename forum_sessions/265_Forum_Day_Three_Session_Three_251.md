Forum Day Three: Session Three 251
PATSY
Yes.
ERHARD
Serving lunch late to your husband is serving lunch late to your husband. That’s all it is. And
that woman hung herself. Can you see that you hung yourself? Isn’t it silly to hang yourself
because someone got a divorce? It’s a joke, and you guys don’t get the joke. Life is a joke. Are
you getting that?
PATSY (grimly)
Yes. Very clear.
ERHARD
Yes, you are getting that. And you’re having the appropriate response to it at the moment. And
you’re not all the way through it yet. Good.
(applause)
She sat. A participant named Beverly stood.
BEVERLY
I want to know, “now what?” I’m looking for a new possibility, a new language so I can relate
to people, to work for both of... And now I’m hearing that I’ve been transformed, and...
ERHARD
And you don’t like it. You don’t like “transformed.”
BEVERLY
No, because they have to be transformed again. Go to a new level.
ERHARD
There are no levels. This is all there is.
BEVERLY
As far as each individual is concerned there are levels.
ERHARD
Who told you that? Did you speak to the Pope personally? This is a product of your infi nite
wisdom?
BEVERLY
People diff er from person to person.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
So what? Each rock is diff erent from each other. So what? There’s some mythology going on
here with this levels stuff . Tell me about levels.
BEVERLY
I don’t know about levels. I’m just hearing that people are transformed.
ERHARD
Who?
BEVERLY
Friends and those that are here...
ERHARD
Do you know what it is to be transformed?
BEVERLY
No.
ERHARD
What it is to be transformed is to know that life is empty and meaningless—and I don’t mean
know like hear and understand, I mean know like “be.” When you are that life is empty and
meaningless, and you’re not making anything out of that, and you’re not doing anything with
it, and it’s not a justifi cation, and it’s not an explanation, and there’s no prescription, and
it doesn’t give you a prescription, then you’re transformed. When you are that life is empty
and meaningless, and when that doesn’t give you anything—in other words, when you are
that life is empty and meaningless and that doesn’t give you a prescription for living, and it
doesn’t explain everything, it’ll give you light. It’ll light up everything. In that moment I got
it, when I got that everything was in order to make it, the universe lit up. I didn’t need to
know anything. I didn’t need to know that there was a fl oor down there holding me up. It was
just there. So what it is to be transformed is to be that life is empty and meaningless, and to be
that it’s empty and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless: To be that life is not going
to work out. And you are not someday going to have a relationship into which you put your
heart and soul.
BEVERLY
I want life to be easy.
ERHARD
Life is not going to be easier. You’re not going to fi nd an answer. It’s going to be just like it is.
And you can bank on that. Life’s been around for a long time. It’s always only been like it is.
And tomorrow it’s going to be like it is tomorrow. But you’re not living there. You live for it to be
easy, which means you haven’t lived yet.
When you are that life is empty and mean-
ingless, and you’re not making anything out
of that, and you’re not doing anything with
it, and it’s not a justification, and it’s not an
explanation, and there’s no prescription, and
it doesn’t give you a prescription, then you’re
transformed.
