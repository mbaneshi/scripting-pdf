Forum Day Four: Session Three 523
my experience in church. But let me tell you something: I’ve never had the kind of experience
with church like I’ve had at the service I’m inviting you to. It’s extraordinary. Whatever your
experience has been, I promise this is worth doing, and I’m not hustling you to go to church, or
I am, whatever you like. The last thing for me: Be at one of the seven evening sessions and get
all that shit out of your head about my reasons for asking you. The other thing is that there is
a lot of talk about me, and most of it is bullshit. I’m not worth all that talk, but there are some
things I am worth.
Here Erhard told a story about an “award” he had received from a professor of English at the
University of New Delhi—a Professor Manmohan—who had traveled with him in India. Normally,
Manmohan was very quiet. But when he’d talk with Erhard about Erhard’s work, he’d always ask
when Erhard was going to bring it to India.
ERHARD
Eventually we did do the work in India, and Manmohan had participated in the fi rst program
we did. One of the things he got, he got the possibility of an extraordinary relationship with
his father. Manmohan had a good relationship with his father, but particularly in the Indian
culture, it doesn’t matter how old you are, you are always your father’s son. Manmohan took the
train back to his father’s village and they sat and talked for hours, and they cried together, and
everything was wonderful, and opened up, and all that stuff . And Manmohan said, “Werner, my
father asked me ‘Son, what happened to you?’ And he told him about the work, and his father
said, ‘Oh, I understand, son: you found a guru.’” By the way, “you found a guru” is not an insult
in Indian culture. In this country it’s an insult. You’re in good shape if you found your guru in
India. Manmohan said to me, “You know Werner, I had to think about it, because I had just
fi nished being really straight with my father, and I really wanted to be straight with him and
answer his question. I told my father ‘No, father, I didn’t fi nd a guru. I found a friend.’” That’s
the most important award I’ve ever gotten. It’s the only one I want. And what I can promise you
is that I am your friend and I will always be here for you. I’ll always be for the possibility you
are, and if I never see you again, I’ll still be your friend for the rest of our time. So, if somebody
asks you: “You went to The Forum with Werner, who’s he?” You say “He’s a friend of mine” and
you’ll be telling them the truth. Thank you very much, and good night.
Erhard left the room through the opening in the curtains at the back of the platform, to a standing
ovation.
KIPP (walking up onto the platform)
Okay. On we go, into the wee hours of the morning! Does anybody want to go home?
(cheers of “no”)
Okay. Let’s welcome the visitors here in the room.

SPEAKING BEING
Kipp then introduced himself to the visitors (those who have completed The Forum sometime in the
past and who had shared that experience with those taking the current Forum), as well as Wes, and
a long, standing ovation ensued.
KIPP
Thank you! I’d like to give some of you in The Forum an opportunity to say something to the
people who came in to complete The Forum with us tonight.
Kipp proceeded to select a participant to stand and share, and selected new participants who had
raised their hands as soon as one fi nished speaking.
SALLY (moved)
Thank you Roger, very very much, for sticking with me and being quite a person, a big person.
And your contributions to me, I value them, they are very important. This experience has
allowed me to get off  it. Quite a bit. And you know I’m on it. That’s a lot. That’s a lot. Now I
won’t have to spend so much time defending myself. I know there’s nothing to be afraid of.
Thanks!
KIPP (to applause)
Well done. Thank you!
CIARLA
Ken introduced me to The Forum about fi ve years ago, and at that time I didn’t take the
opportunity like I’m doing now. Thank you very much for having me participate in this work,
and I want you to know that I love you. I’m looking very much forward—we just got engaged
a couple months ago—and I’m very much looking forward to the rest of our lives together.
Thanks!
KIPP (to applause)
Thank you!
PAUL
There are three woman in my life who are here, and I am madly in love with each of them:
my mother, my future mother-in-law, and my fi ancée. These three women stand for me, no
matter what. They have a commitment to me being great, and I love them for it. I can say out
of this work, and I’ve been participating for a while, I know my relationship with Becky will
last forever out of just us saying so. Not out of how I feel, because I don’t feel like it a lot. It’s
really just out of our commitment, and our stand together, the possibility of this work and the
diff erence we can make, just like giving it away. And I just really want to say to you three that I
love you, and thanks!
KIPP (to applause)
Very nice!
