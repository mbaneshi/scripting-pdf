SPEAKING BEING
BILL
Simply, it’s nonexistent.
KIPP
Or: The fl oor is down there because...
BILL
There’s no “because” to the fl oor being down there.
KIPP
The fl oor is down there because...
BILL
There’s no reason for it to be down there.
KIPP
And the fl oor is down there because...
BILL (laughing)
It doesn’t have a because. Because somebody built it and stuck it there.
KIPP
The fl oor is down there because...
BILL
I shouldn’t have volunteered to continue with this. I seem to be losing it.
KIPP
That’s fi ne. That’s the diff erence between a distinction and a defi nition. You can’t get a distinc-
tion by defi ning it, or exampling it; you can only get it by creating it... So the fl oor is down there
because... Okay, forget about the fl oor, but the ceiling’s up there because...
BILL (looking up)
Because it’s there.
KIPP
Where? Up there, right? The ceiling’s up there because it’s up there.
BILL
...because the ceiling’s up there. Is that correct?
