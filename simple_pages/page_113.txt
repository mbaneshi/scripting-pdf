Forum Day Two: Session One

ERHARD
So, whatever it is you’re resisting, it’s exactly the same in its end result as what it is you’re
indulging. If I’m addicted to anger, I’m no more or less attached to anger than if I was resisting 
anger. Clear about that part?
MIKE
I am clear about that part.
ERHARD
Good. Let’s go to the next part. By virtue of not being angry... You see, what being eff ective at re-
lating is about for Marsha, it’s about not being angry. So what’s the result of relating eff ectively?
MIKE
I’m lost.
ERHARD
You’re not lost. You’re intelligent. You’re clear that you don’t understand what I’m saying. Say-
ing you understand when you don’t is “lost.” Clear?
t
MIKE
I want to say yes, but... go ahead.
ERHARD
Is it clear that you aren’t lost?
MIKE
It’s clear that I don’t know what you are talking about right now.
ERHARD
Yeah. That’s pretty clear isn’t it? So you’re not lost. You’re clear.
MIKE
I got that.
ERHARD
Good. Now we’re going back to this business about “if I relate well in order to avoid anger,”
what is the result of my relating well?
MIKE
I’m avoiding the anger.
ERHARD
Perfect. Is there any satisfaction in that? Is that going to leave you whole?
