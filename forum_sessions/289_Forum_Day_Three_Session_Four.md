Forum Day Three: Session Four
275
FRED
When I made out my list of items for doing The Forum, I put down twenty-six individual,
separate, items on the form I fi lled out for The Forum. And as I shared my detailed list with the
lady I spoke to when I registered, she was aghast. What is driving me in the direction of twenty-
six items that need to get handled otherwise my life isn’t... Where is the value in me standing up
here?
KIPP
Not in those twenty-six items.
FRED
Yeah, I got that far.
ERHARD
Who said there was any value? Who said there was supposed to be any value? Who said that life
was about value?
FRED
Um, that if I accomplish those things, then I would be of value.
ERHARD
No you wouldn’t. You’d be a guy walking around saying I accomplished those twenty-six things
and now I have value. Nothing wrong with that.
FRED
Yeah.
ERHARD
Who said that those things were of value, was you.
FRED
Yeah, I did.
ERHARD
He made that up. It’s okay with me that he made that up. But he’s not the Pope, and the Pope
doesn’t say that. He said that. The only problem with it is if he believes in it, if he believes
that it’s true. If he believes that he said that and that’s the game he’s playing, that’s wonderful.
You don’t have any value. You’re nothing. Nothing and bullshit. No value. And you’ve got a
mouth. And you can say, “I’ve got these twenty-six projects, twenty-six commitments, and
accomplishing them gives me value, because I said so.” Let me ask you a question. Is a ball
in a hole at one end of a fi eld more valuable than a ball on the top of a little stick at the other
end of the fi eld? Which is the more valuable condition? A ball in a hole? Or a ball on a stick?
A lot of people think that God said that balls in holes are better than balls on sticks. They’re
called golfers. They think that it is that way, and not that someone made it up... If you forget

SPEAKING BEING
that you say so, you do get nutty about it instead of having fun. So yeah, your twenty-six things:
wonderful as long as they belong to you.
FRED
I just had the thought standing up here, that if I have so many things going on then I can avoid
domination. Because I could always say “I’m too busy. I’ve got this meeting to go to so I can’t go
to this other meeting.”
ERHARD
Lots of people too busy to do anything. Who in here is too busy to do anything? “I don’t get to
accomplish anything because I’m too busy.”
FRED
I gave up the twenty-six items and I saw that there’s no satisfaction in them. I’m driven to them,
and there’s no sense of empowerment. So I’m actually looking at the wonder of complacency.
That it might be just wonderful to go home and watch TV, have a beer and forget about my
twenty-six items. There might be more authenticity in relaxing, watching TV with a beer than
scrambling after my twenty-six items.
ERHARD
Yeah, and neither one of them is going to get you anyplace.
(pausing)
And you’re actually going to do what you’re going to do anyhow, not what you contemplate
doing. You haven’t got much choice about it. In fact, none. You can only do what you do; you
can’t do what you don’t do. As soon as I fi nd someone who has done what they didn’t do, we’re
going to stop doing The Forum because it’ll be bullshit. So far, looking through half a million
people, we haven’t found anybody who did what they didn’t do. Everyone’s only done what
they did.
(to another participant sitting)
Get that? You ever do anything you didn’t do? You only do what you do, right?
PARTICIPANT
I do what I want to do.
ERHARD
You do what you want to do?
PARTICIPANT
Always.
ERHARD
Always?
ERHARD (continuing)
