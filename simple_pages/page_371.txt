(laughter)
Don’t go around telling people life is empty and meaningless. Live your life from it. Don’t tell 
people that. So what there is to get is that life is empty and meaningless and that that doesn’t 
have any meaning. That is to say: the fact that life is empty and meaningless is empty and 
meaningless. It’s just empty and meaningless.
JOYCE
I get that.
ERHARD
Okay, that’s all there is to get for the moment. I didn’t say you have to feel good. 
Erhard continued working one by one with the people who had stood because they did not get that 
life is empty and meaningless. 
ERHARD  (to another participant)
What is your problem?
SALLY
I’m having a hard time with life being empty and meaningless that life is empty and 
meaningless.
ERHARD
Let me make it easy for you. Life is empty and meaningless: Did you get that part?
SALLY
Yes.
ERHARD
What does that mean? What is the signifi cance of that statement?
SALLY
That it’s empty and meaningless, but I’m sitting here thinking, “Fuck it! Who cares?”
ERHARD
No, you just made it mean something. You didn’t get it because you made it mean something. 
You said, “well if it’s empty and meaningless then...” See, once you said “then,” you didn’t get 
it; you ruined it. Is that clear what I just said?
SALLY
Yeah, then it becomes something. Then it means something.
