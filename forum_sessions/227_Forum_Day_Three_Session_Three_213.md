Forum Day Three: Session Three 213
ERHARD
Wait. Wait. See you just ruined it.
TONY
I’m just kidding.
ERHARD
You’re like a block and a half ahead of everybody. We’ve got to get everybody caught up to
you. That’s why we got to discuss this now. There when you were a block and a half ahead of
everybody, you made it mean something. “Then why am I here?” Well, where else would you
be if you weren’t here? You’d be some other stupid place. You’re here because you’re here. You
want to start getting what he’s saying. It’s not really a soap opera. It’s really a joke. You know
what a joke is? A joke is when you think the soap opera’s real. That’s a joke. The joke is when
you think you’re going to get someplace. That’s a joke. That’s a joke.
TONY
That’s a fi x.
ERHARD
Exactly. And that thing about “that’s why the world doesn’t work”; no, the world works fi ne.
It works just like this. And the idea that you’re going to make the world work, whatever that
means to you, is another joke. Look around you. That’s the way it is. Just like this.
TONY
But we’ve gotten what the rest of the world hasn’t gotten.
ERHARD
So what? The fucking walls are still the walls. The ceiling is still the ceiling. Life is still the way
it is.
TONY
But by being diff erent...
ERHARD
What do you mean by diff erent?
TONY
By going through what we’ve just been through.
ERHARD
You’re no diff erent.
TONY
Okay.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Listen to me. You are exactly the way you are. You’re not the way you were, you are the way you are.
(interrupting Tony)
Have you ever not been the way you are?
TONY
I think I’ve always been the way I am.
ERHARD
And you want to know what? It’s going to be that way.
TONY
I’m just thinking that we’re more powerful now.
ERHARD
You’re more powerful than you were, so what? You’re as powerful as you are. And you’ve
always been as powerful as you are. That’s part of that illusion, part of the fi x. More powerful.
I’m going to tell you how all this work started for me. I spent my whole life learning how to
make it, or making it. I’m smart, and I worked real hard at it. I studied everything and did
everything. And then one day I was sitting in the car, and I realized I was never going to make
it. I looked back at my life, and it was a joke. I spent thirty-four years of my life climbing a
ladder, got to the top, and found that the ladder didn’t go to the top of the wall. I looked at all
the other ladders and saw that they don’t go over the wall either.
TONY
Why do they have to go up?
ERHARD
That’s the way being human is: climbing ladders that don’t go over the wall. That’s the joke.
That’s what there is to get in here. You are not going to make it. You know what your life is
about? You’re not going to make it. Whatever it’s about. I was real sad when I found that out,
that I wasn’t going to make it. I’d spent thirty-four years trying, thirty-four years of anguish,
thirty-four years of trying to look good. Terrible not to make it. I realized I was never going to be
intelligent enough or good enough, honest enough or contribute enough, anything enough.
TONY
Is it bullshit to think you can make a diff erence?
ERHARD
You make a diff erence if you do, you don’t if you don’t. And if you set up “making a diff erence”
as over the wall, you’ll never get over the wall. You’re making “making a diff erence” the Holy
Grail. No matter what you pick out, if you come through The Forum again three years later
you’ll see it’s a joke. If you make it the Holy Grail, it’ll turn into a fucking joke.
