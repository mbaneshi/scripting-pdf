Forum Day One: Session Two

Philosophy as Rhetorical Evocation
We propose that The Forum is an instance of ontological
rhetoric. We emphasize at the outset that this is not the everyday
understanding of rhetoric as “mere rhetoric,” that is, language that
is superficial and disconnected from serious purposes. Rhetoric as
we use the term is any use of language that is intended to produce
a real-world result. Ontological rhetoric communicates in the
unspoken realm of language to provide its listeners with access to
the realm of Being.
Recognition of the value and function of ontological
rhetoric is found in the later writing of Henry W. Johnstone,
Jr., founder of the journal, Philosophy and Rhetoric. Early in his
career, Johnstone believed that the role of the philosophical
rhetor was “to treat his audience as an object,” and that his goal
should quit or leave.” That’s not the way it works. It’s a rainstorm. Leaving, getting out of things,
quitting—owns your life. It’s true you have the conversation with yourself personally. But that’s
like getting wet in a rainstorm.
(with emphasis)
I’m not thinking that. That is thinking me.
(pausing)
I’m starting to talk like people don’t talk, because I want access to what concerns me that
people don’t have. So you and I are starting to invent a language that gives us access to the
things that are interesting, or important, that concern us in life. It’s not your thought. I want
you to start to think that it thinks you. You have the thoughts like you get wet in the rain-
storm. I’m just asking you to begin to think in a way you haven’t thought before. The kind of
person you are is given by that thinking, which isn’t your thoughts or your thinking.
JOHN
What I noticed was that each of us have diff erent stories about how we got together.
ERHARD
You can’t ask questions like “True?” about people’s stories. There’s no such thing as “true
”
stories.” “True” and “story” don’t go together. A story’s a story. People get into trouble in life
because they start believing their stories. Even worse, you start believing someone else’s story—
makes you a spear-carrier in somebody else’s opera. This is not a good way to live.
JOHN
We did what we did and got married.
ERHARD
Who is not clear about choosing to be married? The conversation about why you’re in The
Forum could apply as well to you in your job, or your marriage. Almost nobody thinks they
are anyplace because they put themselves there. But everybody puts themselves there. Then
you get the story about why you’re there. There’s no power in the story... You live in a story
about being married. I accuse you that you live in a story about being married, and the
quality of being married reflects that it in part is generated by a story. I didn’t say you don’t
have a good marriage. But it’s limited to a certain box, a certain space or quality, when it’s a
story. What happened? You got married. Then there’s this whole story. And they’re distinct
from one another. The same thing is true about everything in life. See, you and I have the
kind of lives that people would have if they lived out of a story. And mostly the story is
constituted mostly by your reasons. But you got that job. That’s what happened.
JOHN
Normally I know that, but I wasn’t clear about that last night. It’s so easy to forget.

SPEAKING BEING
was “to manipulate his audience so as to secure agreement”
(“Persuasion” 19). But a “turn” in Johnstone’s thinking led him
to acknowledge by 1978 that “the distinction between finding
the truth in philosophy and finding the proper rhetorical devices
for propagating it cannot be maintained” (“Truth” 74). In other
words, “truth” is always and already rhetorical, never severed
from its communication, and thus finding the “truth” requires
holding up a pretense that rhetoric is merely a convenient
accessory that can be dispensed with.
Johnstone’s new perspective of the philosophy–rhetoric
relationship was based in the concept of evocation: “My present
view is that a successful argument in philosophy is one that is
intended to evoke, and does evoke, a response of a certain kind
in the man to whom it is addressed” (“Truth” 75). Johnstone cited
Heidegger as evidence for this view, and his description here of
Heidegger’s language use is consistent with our understanding of
both Heidegger’s and Erhard’s thinking:
ERHARD
That’s why we don’t give you anything to remember. You just have to be.
HANNAH
There’s a new babysitter watching the baby while I’m here and I got a note at the break to call
and I immediately felt terror because six months ago there was an accident that threatened his
life.
ERHARD
You understand that the terror is of no value to her? You sympathize with the terror. When you
leave here you’ll be a little more ruthless than you are now. You’ll be concerned for what em-
powers people, not for sympathizing with their weaknesses. No empowerment in terror.
HANNAH
I had lost closeness with him. It was more about clinging, and I saw that it was more about
terror.
ERHARD
Major issues like parenting or confronting death generate the most persistent stories. The things
that are real close to us are hard not to be stupid about. It’s hard to be with that people do die.
And you are going to die. And that’s hard to be with. The more dramatic the soap opera is the
easier it is to get drawn into it and not be able to distinguish the story from what happened.
MAX
I’m here because I want my life to stop being an emergency, in my personal and professional
life. I am an upset waiting to happen.
ERHARD
Some of you are an argument waiting to happen. You’re waiting for the occasion to act out the
argument.
MAX
Turning away from my story to what happened is like becoming an arbitrator. It helps me get
away from my guilt.
ERHARD
If guilt were useful, I would say have a lot of it. Listen up here! This is another one of those
things you want to get. Feeling guilty makes it all right that you did something. If you didn’t feel
guilty you’d be a bad person. That’s not terrible to be a bad person. No, it’s all right to do some-
thing as long as you feel guilty about it. Guilt is the salve we put on something that we did so
that we don’t have to be responsible for it. But you don’t know what I’m talking about because
you don’t know the diff erence between guilt and responsibility at this point. Max?
If I am correct in arguing that Heidegger
conceives philosophy as basically rhetorical,
some revision in our conception of rhetoric
is called for. . . its purpose is not to incite its
hearer to action—even the action of adopting
some specific belief. Instead, rhetoric totally
reorients the hearer; if he listens to it he is in
a position to abandon an inauthentic life in
favor of an authentic one. (“Rhetoric” 68)
“
On this view, the truth of philosophy is intimately infused with
its communicability: “discovery, communication, and rhetoric all
collapse into a unitary philosophical act” (“Truth” 76). Further,
communicability is manifested as evocation: “The only way to tell
whether what I have is a truth or a falsehood,” said Johnstone, “is
to contemplate its evocative power.” And rhetoric, he added, is “the
art of evocation” (“Truth” 76).
Finally, Johnstone’s discussion of Heidegger raises a third issue
which will be particularly relevant in our analysis of The Forum: that
is the question of the appropriate rhetorical style for addressing an
