Forum Day One: Session Four

PARTICIPANT
That’s just life.
ERHARD
It’s life in the fast lane. “The more things change the more they remain the same.” That’s true.
And we’ll look at why that’s so.
PARTICIPANT
There’s fun in engaging with this even though I don’t know what I’m doing.
ERHARD
I don’t know what I’m doing. Would you want to dance knowing what you’re doing? But in
our culture, you’re not allowed not to know. It’s shameful not to know. It’s the way we already
always are. There’s an opportunity to develop a certain relationship with not knowing in here
that will give you a more powerful access to what is worth knowing. With me? Thanks.
(pausing)
I’m not going to call on anybody for a while. We’re going to introduce a new what-you-call
subject. We’re going to introduce a new what-I-call distinction. When this is all over, you’ll call
it that too. The distinction is concern. The usual meaning of concern is “worried about.” When I
use the word concern I use it in a broader sense. You and I are constituted by a body of con-
cerns, kind of like what we attend to.
Erhard drew an X on the chalkboard.
ERHARD  (continuing)
X is a symbol that represents one of your concerns. X could be “being related.”
(responding to a participant asking for clarifi cation)
It could be said that human beings are constituted by a body of concerns. The word constitutive
means something more than “is a part of.” It means something like “gives the thing itself.” It’s
like your concerns give you your self.
PARTICIPANT
It gives the essence of my self...
ERHARD
You’ve got to watch because I’m going to say “no” to damn near everything you’re going to say,
and everything you say is good, but it’s not quite it. We’re not going to get this nailed down and
I’ll show you why in just a second. You’re in the right ballpark. You’re fine.
(pausing)
So X represents one of your concerns. Let’s just say this represents the concern for being related.
Everybody’s got this concern. A hermit expresses this concern by saying “I’m not related.”
CONCERN
In introducing the distinction concern, Erhard is articulating
another hint at the realm of Being the Forum is designed to evoke.
As with his earlier conversation about moods, he is relocating the
source of participants’ problems from their own agency to the
contextualizing background.
In Being and Time, Heidegger makes a similar move when
he says that “Being-in-the-world has always dispersed itself or
even split itself up into definite ways of Being-in.” To develop
this point, he provides a list of examples, such as having to do
with something, producing something, attending to something,
undertaking, and considering. “All these ways of Being-in,” he says
“have concern as their kind of Being” (BT 83).
Heidegger also distinguishes a category that he calls deficient
modes of concern, in which “the possibilities of concern are kept
to a ‘bare minimum’” (BT 83). Deficient modes include leaving
undone, neglecting, renouncing, and taking a rest.
In everyday use, the word “concern” can have several
meanings. The most common in our current usage is
apprehension, as in “I am concerned for the success of our
project.” But Heidegger and Erhard have used the term in another
way, as a term for an existential characteristic of human beings, “a
possible way of Being-in-the-world.”
Just as human beings are never not in-the-world, they are
likewise never not concerned, since they are concern essentially.
Consider: you cannot locate yourself outside of your concerns,
since the very attempt to do so is itself a manifestation of concern.
Like lightning, which exists only in flashing, a human being exists
always and only as a body of concerns.
With this distinction, both Heidegger and Erhard are
undermining our everyday understanding of the meanings in
our world. In so doing, they are preparing the way for the final
transformational leap, the evocation of the Nothing. ■

SPEAKING BEING
You’ve got a concern for being related otherwise why would you be concerned about not being
related? Clear?
(pausing)
What is our access to what concerns us? Our access to what concerns us is to get at what con-
cerns us in its aftermath. After the thing happens, in hindsight, we can understand. You can’t
even see it before it happens, can you? The already always access that human beings have to
their concerns, the access you inherited, is something like this...
To the right of the X Erhard listed description, defi nition, and explanation.
ERHARD (continuing)
...All of which, will lead to understanding.
(adding “understanding” to the list)
And out of understanding you derive prescriptions, which gives you guidance for how to deal
with what concerns you: ten steps to... Now, you haven’t articulated all your prescriptions, have
you? Because a lot of your prescriptions are contained in the way you are. They’re set in you.
You want to get this! This is one of those things you have to get. This conversation’s got to be
there for the whole Forum.
(pausing)
So you’ve got, for example, golden rules about relations, such as “keep them happy,” “do some-
thing so they’re attached to you,” et cetera. You and I have got great prescriptions. And what
you can predict out of that is that you and I will get better and better at that. A rat can learn
how to negotiate a maze by finding a piece of cheese, but will choose a new tunnel if the cheese
is moved. The difference between a human being and a rat is as follows: a human being will go
down the tunnel with no cheese forever. You know, you’ve been doing the same shit year after
year after year, hoping for a different outcome. What you care about is being in the right tunnel,
regardless of whether there’s cheese or not. Doing the same thing over and over again expecting
different results. That’s the definition of insanity.
(turning to the chalkboard and indicating the empty space to the left of the X)
Nobody looks over here, before it happens.
(writing the word “source”)
That’s where it’s generated, that’s where it’s created. You want to listen up to this next part. Wake
up! Wake up! When you get to the source of something you are no longer limited by it. That, by
the way, is a part of how this works: by getting to the source of things.
(to Wes and Kipp)
I promise that tomorrow I will give them one answer—the answer to what those guys on moun-
taintops in Tibet are looking for.
(pausing)
We’re going to get at concerns from the source side. You don’t get description, definition,
explanation, and prescription—you just get power. You don’t get a PhD out of here. Plato and
Socrates killed that kind of research anyway. They tried it and found out it didn’t work. You read
