Forum Day Four: Session Two
437
don’t comprehend versus being willing to think. In order to create that distinction, Bill, and
if you were sitting in your chair doing the demonstration, you had to think. It wasn’t given by
thoughts; you had to really think. So I’m asking you to start thinking that thinking and distin-
guishing are synonymous—not perfectly, not neatly. But you have to think to get a distinction,
to bring forth distinction.
(to Bill)
And that’s what you were willing to do. And you were big about it. And we appreciate it.
Bill returned to his seat as the group applauded. Another participant, Joan, raised her hand and
stood.
JOAN
I feel really stupid. I didn’t get it.
KIPP
Okay. What didn’t you get?
JOAN (in tears)
I don’t understand how to make a choice without a reason.
KIPP
The reasons are still there, aren’t they? They don’t go away.
JOAN
No they don’t. I have a zillion of them.
KIPP
What’s a current choice you need to make?
JOAN
Figuring out what I want to do with my life. It sounds really stupid. What I want to do for a job.
KIPP
Okay. “What I want to do for a job.” You have a couple diff erent ideas?
JOAN
Yes.
KIPP
Okay good. What are the ideas?

SPEAKING BEING
JOAN
Start my own business.
KIPP
Okay.
JOAN
Or work for a small company.
KIPP
Let’s take those two for an example, Okay? Start your own business, work for a small company:
choose!
JOAN (laughing)
Start my own company.
KIPP
Perfect! Now why are you going to start your own company? “I’m going to start my own compa-
ny because...”
JOAN
Because my father did.
KIPP
Perfect reason! That’s an example of a decision. What has you now starting your own company
is your father did that: That’s not you making a choice, is it? It’s your father, so if it doesn’t work
out, you can kick the shit out of your father.
(laughter)r
Decisions get you off  the hook, don’t they? Because the reason “because my father did” has you
starting your own company, not you. When you make a choice, you’re the chooser. You can
still have all the thoughts; you can still carefully consider it all. I’m not saying to throw out the
analysis. But if what you do is based on your analysis, I promise you a future determined by
the past. Because analysis is always looking where? What’s already happened! And so far, that’s
where you look in your life. You go:
(contorting his body to look behind him)
“Let’s see what’s possible in my life.”
JOAN (laughing)
Yes I do that.
