Forum Day Four: Session Three 485
not clumsy. There’s no quality called clumsy. Put your hands down for a second. The only
hands I want to see are those who can say “I didn’t get that.” Not an “I have a question”
hand, but an “I didn’t get that” hand.
Seven people stood. Erhard moved to work with Art, and requested of the others that if they got it
when Art got it, they should sit down.
ART
I’m trying to come up with answers. The occurring for life... That’s just how they see it.
ERHARD
It’s not quite right, and what’s not quite right about it is that it’s not a physiological
phenomenon; it’s an ontological phenomenon. The ball exists as slow or fast. It’s not seeing. It’s
not perceiving. The ball exists as slow or fast. It’s not “I see the ball.” The ball is, like existence,
slow or fast.
ART
I’m trying to put that into my life. I used to ride motorcycles and I could ride really fast and I
can see little things in the road at ninety miles an hour.
ERHARD
Because the bike is occurring as slow for you.
ART
Well I’m with the bike, I know how to do that.
ERHARD
No. That’s your explanation. You do not know shit about how to do it. As a matter of fact, go out
on your bike and try to ride it out of what you know. Try it. You race your bike?
ART
Yes.
ERHARD
Try racing your bike out of what you know.
ART
I’d pop the clutch and it would shut off .
ERHARD
Yeah, exactly. You don’t race out of what you know. You race out of the occurring. So let me ask you...
(getting the dictionary and then tossing it at Art)
what does your behaving have to do with what you know?
While Martin Heidegger’s thinking was consistent in its focus
on the question of Being, his philosophical inquiry led him along a
number of paths within this domain. None is of greater relevance to
our current cultural situation than his perspective on technology,
a subject central in his thinking during the last forty years of his
career (Zimmerman, “Beyond ‘Humanism’” 219). In this light then,
it is significant for our inquiry that Werner Erhard has chosen the
name “technology of transformation” for his own project (“The
Heart of the Matter” 1985). In these series of sidebars concerning
technology, we will show how Erhard’s choice of this term
indicates, paradoxically, both a crucial intersection of his work with
Heidegger’s thought, and at the same time, Erhard’s contrast with
what we might call Heidegger’s “racket”—a persistent complaint
with a fixed way of being—concerning modern technology.
Regarding technology, Heidegger is emphatic on two
points. First, we have misunderstood its nature; and second, as a
consequence of this misunderstanding, we have underestimated
its role and influence in the current human condition. Our
problems with technology—which might include overuse,
inadequate mastery, overreliance, and addiction—do not arise
because of some incorrect understanding of technology, for
instance, as a human contrivance, as an instrument for our use,
or as a means to serve our ends. Rather, our problems with
technology have arisen in an epoch in which we can no longer
grasp that “the merely correct is not yet the true” (“QCT” in
BW 313). Our instrumental understanding, wherein anything
worthy of understanding must be able to be put to use, fails to
reach deeply enough to capture technology’s essential impulse.
Here Heidegger develops that particular point:
Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to
technology, whether we passionately aff irm
or deny it. But we are delivered over to it in
the worst possible way when we regard it as
something neutral; for this conception of it, to
which today we particularly like to pay hom-
age, makes us utterly blind to the essence of
technology. (“QCT” in BW 311–312)

SPEAKING BEING
ART (having caught the dictionary)
I just reacted.
ERHARD
That’s your explanation. There wasn’t any reaction. There was a dictionary and hands. You
made up “reaction.” That’s your story about what happened. All that happened was a dictionary
fl ying and your hands moving.
ART
Yes.
ERHARD
You didn’t say to yourself, “Oh, put the microphone under my arm, reach out my hands...” None
of that happened. None of your athletic experience there either. Not one bit of it was there, was
it?
ART
No.
ERHARD
No. Nothing. What was there was fl ying dictionary and moving hands; because your hands—
the motion of your hands—are a correlate of the dictionary as an occurring. Suppose the
dictionary... give me my dictionary back.
(laughter as Erhard receives the dictionary back from Art)
If I throw the dictionary at you so you can’t catch it, what are you going to do? You’re going to
go like this, aren’t you?
(fl inching)
Not like you did the last time. Why? Because you’re not athletic? No, because the dictionary
occurs as uncatchable, and your actions are perfectly correlated with an uncatchable dictionary.
Got it?
ART
Yes, but it just seems foggy. Like I’m always trying to come up with an answer for everything.
I don’t want to use the wrong words here. I can understand but I want to come up with an
answer for it.
ERHARD
No, you want to put it to use. You mean, “Shit, I can’t fi gure out a way to use this yet.”
ART
Well, I don’t see how to apply it to my life.
And in What Is Called Thinking he posits that
. . .the essence of technology is not anything
human. The essence of technology is above
all not anything technological. The essence of
technology lies in what from the beginning and
before all else gives food for thought. It might
then be advisable, at least for the time being,
to talk and write less about technology, and
give more thought to where its essence lies, so
that we might first find a way to it. The essence
of technology pervades our existence in a way
which we have barely noticed so far. (WCT 22)
“
Heidegger concludes this thought with a reversal: “Our age is not
a technological age because it is the age of the machine, it is an
age of the machine because it is the technological age” (WCT 24).
We are reminded of one of the central rhetorical figures Erhard
employs throughout The Forum, in many instances, wherein the
commonplace understanding we have of ourselves as conscious
agents of our lives is thrown into question: “You don’t think it; it
thinks you.” As our thinking enters into this antithetical “figure of
thought”—which rhetoricians term chiasmus—again and again
during the course of The Forum, this way of thinking, as a technology
of transformation, opens us toward new possibilities to be.
But if we hold this figure of thought at a distance, refusing
to follow its course, it loses any of its transformational power. As
scholar Hubert Dreyfus observes, Heidegger’s position with regard
to technology is easily misunderstood as a position, when it is
more appropriate to follow it as a movement. Dreyfus writes that
Heidegger’s “view is so radical that one is tempted to translate
it into conventional platitudes about the evils of technology, so
Heidegger’s ontological concerns are mistakenly assimilated to
ontic humanistic threats about the devastation of nature, the
atomic threat, the media, consumerism, et cetera” (“Gaining a
