Forum Day Four: Session Two 
431
KIPP
Perfect! Why did you choose chocolate?
BILL
I chose chocolate... because I enjoy choosing chocolate. 
KIPP (pulling out another tissue to a elongated “peep!”
(
)”
“I enjoy” is like a feeling, a thought, a consideration, a reason, isn’t it? It’s based on your enjoy-
ment. That reason came along and selected it again.
BILL
I do not know how to make a choice without... with using the word because. I must have missed 
something.
KIPP
You didn’t miss anything. They are real glad it’s you up here, not them. 
(applause)
When you come from life is empty and meaningless and you’re able to be with your racket,
choice opens up for you, but you don’t know anything about choice. Why we are working this 
way is to distinguish something called choice, and a choice is based on nothing: It’s a pure 
choice, simply because you choose. Chocolate/Vanilla: choose!
BILL (fi nally

I choose chocolate simply because I choose... chocolate.
The participants erupted in applause.
KIPP
The important thing is all his reasons, thoughts, feelings considerations, are still there, weren’t 
they? See, you think you have to get rid of these...
(holding up all the tissues he had pulled out of the box)
In order to make a choice. No. They are all still there, except his choice isn’t based on these.
He has his reasons, his thoughts, his feelings, his considerations, but he’s not being those. He’s 
being his choice. You think you have to get rid of all these, then you can make a choice. Yes? 
BILL
I thought that way. I think that way.
