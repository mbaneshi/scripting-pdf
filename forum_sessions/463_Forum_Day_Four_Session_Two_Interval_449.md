Forum Day Four: Session Two Interval 449
It is the authors’ policy, consistent with the thinking we are exploring, to allow
questions to remain open, and if possible to open them further. We therefore pro-
pose this response that opens up a new line of inquiry: it is the nature of Being to
withdraw.
[T]his concealing of its essence and of its essential origin is
characteristic of Being’ s primordial self-illumination. . . .
The being itself does not step into this light of Being. The
unconcealment of beings, the brightness granted them,
obscures the light of Being. As it reveals itself in beings,
Being withdraws. [. . .] Man’s inability to see himself corre-
sponds to the self-concealing of the lighting of Being. (EGT
26, emphasis added)
Being is always the context of meaninglessness from which the meanings have
emerged, the everything/nothing of the sway from which the Greeks struggled to
bring forth beings. Not-Being is Being’s flipside, and must remain its persistent ori-
entation, as Heidegger finds in this passage from the pre-Socratic thinker Heraclitus
(Fragment 123):
Physis kryptesthai philei: Being [emerging appearance] in-
trinsically inclines toward self-concealment. Being means:
to appear in emerging, to step forth out of concealment—
and for this very reason, concealment and the provenance
from concealment essentially belong to Being. Such prove-
nance lies in the essence of Being, of what appears as such.
Being remains inclined toward concealment, whether in
great veiling and silence, or in the most superficial distort-
ing and obscuring. (IM 126, emphases added)
It is essential to recognize, then, that the emergence of physis into the world, and
the unconcealment of Being’s truth that is manifested in such emergence, is never a
once-and-for-all event.
It is the power of logos to hold together what tends apart, maintaining the
oppositional tendencies of that which it gathers in “the highest acuteness of its ten-
sion” (IM 149). But this is not achieved without human participation in the struggle:
“Where struggle ceases, beings indeed do not disappear, but world turns away”
(IM 68, emphases added).
The mystery of Being, for the fortunate among us, may cease for a moment to
be a mystery. That moment may be a minute, a month, or even a year. But inevita-
“
“
bly the mystery becomes again a mystery, a puzzlement. Finding one’s way back
into the heart of the mystery is the adventure of emergence returning to conceal-
ment and emerging and returning to concealment. It is the ongoing challenge of
transformation.

SPEAKING BEING
When The Forum resumed at 6:35 pm, following the dinner break, Wes and Kipp were on the
platform. Kipp began the session requesting that participants share what they had seen about
“choice.” The fi rst to respond was Mac, the man in a wheelchair who had previously complained on
the morning of Day Two about the late ending time of the fi rst day.
MAC
You’ll have to indulge me because I have a need to thank your organization for going out of
their way for me. It was generous. It was done with love and caring. Good stuff .
KIPP
You’re worth it.
MAC
Thanks.
KIPP
Thank you very much.
(applause)
MAC
I also have a need to share with you a progression. I came here and some of you remember that
I was kind of angry. The fi rst thing I said was “Goddamn it, what the hell are you keeping us up
for, to one o’clock, we need our sleep.” Someone I was carpooling with asked what I thought, and
I said, “Werner Erhard: He’s an asshole.” That’s how I started this. A lot of anger. The next day
they asked me, and I said, “You know, he’s not bad.” Today I am convinced he is a genius. And
all you guys really know your stuff , and really care about people, how to get the most for people.
I want to thank you because it has made a big diff erence in my life. I thought I knew a lot of
stuff , and I really don’t. I’ve discovered it doesn’t matter that I don’t know very much. What the
hell’s the diff erence? What is, is. That’s what I’ve discovered here today. I was having dinner and
someone asked what are we going to tell people what we got out of this and what it is all about?
We’ll tell them “Why don’t you go and experience it. It’s a hell of an experience. Period.” Because
I don’t know how to describe in words what has happened to me.
KIPP
You are in the sharing of yourself. Your sharing is the opening for action for people.
MAC
I get it.
KIPP
See, when you share like you just shared, Mac, people want to participate. Whatever opened up
for you in your life, the way you said it, is consistent with who people are. You just share your self.
