SPEAKING BEING
ANGEL
And so I turned it around in my second marriage, where I was happy, but then I created the
divorce so I could be a victim of the divorce.
ERHARD
Watch that word “created”; that gets bandied around by people who have done this work, and
they don’t know what they’re talking about. What happened was: you got divorced. And that
left you deeply unhappy.
ANGEL
The same place I was when I was married before.
ERHARD
Yeah. So you’ve got to get to the point where a fart and having been divorced are on equal levels. 
(laughter)r
ANGEL
There’s something very wrong about that. I don’t know what it is...
(laughter)r
Is that really possible?
ERHARD
Yeah it is really possible. They’re both just a “what happened.”
(laughter)r
People who get married sometimes get divorced, true or false?
ANGEL
True.
ERHARD
You got married and you got divorced, true or false?
ANGEL
True.
ERHARD
And that’s what happened. Like a fart.
