Forum Day Three: Session Four 
275
FRED
When I made out my list of items for doing The Forum, I put down twenty-six individual, 
separate, items on the form I fi lled out for The Forum. And as I shared my detailed list with the 
lady I spoke to when I registered, she was aghast. What is driving me in the direction of twenty-
six items that need to get handled otherwise my life isn’t... Where is the value in me standing up 
here?
KIPP
Not in those twenty-six items.
FRED
Yeah, I got that far.
ERHARD
Who said there was any value? Who said there was supposed to be any value? Who said that life 
was about value? 
FRED
Um, that if I accomplish those things, then I would be of value.
ERHARD
No you wouldn’t. You’d be a guy walking around saying I accomplished those twenty-six things 
and now I have value. Nothing wrong with that.
FRED
Yeah.
ERHARD
Who said that those things were of value, was you.
FRED
Yeah, I did.
ERHARD
He made that up. It’s okay with me that he made that up. But he’s not the Pope, and the Pope 
doesn’t say that. He said that. The only problem with it is if he believes in it, if he believes 
that it’s true. If he believes that he said that and that’s the game he’s playing, that’s wonderful. 
You don’t have any value. You’re nothing. Nothing and bullshit. No value. And you’ve got a 
mouth. And you can say, “I’ve got these twenty-six projects, twenty-six commitments, and 
accomplishing them gives me value, because I said so.” Let me ask you a question. Is a ball 
in a hole at one end of a fi eld more valuable than a ball on the top of a little stick at the other 
end of the fi eld? Which is the more valuable condition? A ball in a hole? Or a ball on a stick? 
A lot of people think that God said that balls in holes are better than balls on sticks. They’re 
called golfers. They think that it is that way, and not that someone made it up... If you forget
