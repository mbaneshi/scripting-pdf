WES
You see that?
ILLIANA (nodding and smiling)
Yes.
WES
Yeah. This is a woman who just got the lie in her life. Why you’re driven to the “but” is your
racket. You’ll fi nd yourself taking things and putting “but” between them. Opposing them from
your racket. You’ll have to train yourself in telling the truth.
ILLIANA
The “but” makes it fi ghting. “And” is making peace.
WES
Yes! Very good!
ILLIANA
Thank you.
(applause)
Paul stood up again, the participant who can speak several languages and who struggled to get the
distinction “being inauthentic” during Session Two of Day One.
PAUL
I see something now about having my foot nailed to the floor. When you were going around
there: I saw myself one day going around in my living room in a circle, and it just cracked
me up that I did that. What’s come out of it, I sat there wanting to go into real estate, and
wanting to have a career in real estate, but I don’t know if I should because I... “I’m not re-
ally good at this, I don’t understand it. I really should go to school. But school takes a lot of
money and I don’t have a lot of money and I hate my job. And I hate my job because I can’t
make a lot of money.” It just kept going and going and going. What’s funny is that it led to
me coming here, because I got that everything, this all is going to collapse and I’ll be dead.
If I don’t do something about it, or do something, it’ll be the end of me. Not only that, I can
see how I’ve done this with other things I love in my life, like music, that I’ve completely
talked myself right out of it. It’s something I wanted to do but I started too late. I’m not
a great technician and I don’t have all these things. And I eventually lost sight of the fact
that I just like making music. Instead of just being in that making music I’ve gotten tangled
up in all the little piddly details and it became a racket after a while. And it kept me from
dealing with the fact that I have to practice if I want to make it, and I didn’t want to. Now it
is so easy to see it. Now I’d like to get home and play.
You can confirm facts 1 and 2 for yourself by checking them
out in your own experience.  Regarding fact 1:  Is your way of being
at this moment—that is, some combination of your attitude, and
your feelings, plus your body sensations, and your thoughts and
memories regarding what you are dealing with—consistent with
t
your way of acting in this moment?  Or more pointedly, is your way
of being and way of acting consistent with each other, virtually
arising as one thing?
And then, fact 2:  Is your way of being and acting (arising as
though one thing) correlated with (closely connected with) the
way what you are dealing with occurs or shows up for you?  And,
has that been essentially true in situations you have dealt with in
the past?  (For those of you who are tempted to do so, don’t stop
at understanding the text of what we said; rather, take the time to
actually check it out in your own as-lived experience.)
d
In summary:  Our way of being and acting is correlated with
d
(naturally, necessarily, closely connected with; in-a-dance-with)
the way in which what we are dealing with occurs for us.
During the course everything in this section will be gone over
and made clear for you so that you can confirm its validity in your
own lived experience.  In addition, the critical importance for being
a leader and the eff ective exercise of leadership of what has been
covered in this section will be dealt with in depth during the in-
class sessions of the course.
A Fact about the Way in which what we are
Dealing With Occurs for us
When we go through life such that who we are is whatever we are
referring to when we say “I” or “me” (which is the way we usually
do go through life), there is a background for the way in which life,
d
living, and self occur for us.  That is, when who we are for ourselves
r
is what we are referring to when we say “I” or “me,” this back-
ground (or we could say “environment”) for the way in which life,

SPEAKING BEING
WES
Right. It opens up participation. Your problems are stops to participation.
PAUL
It’s not this big tragedy anymore, like “I’ve got to commit myself to this!” Just do it.
WES
Great. Thanks.
DOREL
I’ve been sitting here thinking about my problems, and there’s a lot of them.
KIPP
All the problems you have in your languaging.
DOREL
In my languaging.
KIPP
You see the diff erence between those? There are no problems in your life, are there?
DOREL
I think I see what you’re saying, it’s just that I created...
KIPP
Be careful about this creation business. They live in the conversation you are. There are no
problems out there. Your dog never has any problems. And when you say you have a lot of
problems in your life, you’re saying there’s this “life” someplace that contains these problems;
the problems are in your conversations. Languaging.
DOREL
One of the things I got was that I get easily upset and angry.
KIPP
You’re kidding. How did you get in here? He gets easily upset? Angry?
(laughter)r
DOREL
I think a big source of that is I want to make others wrong.
living, and self occur for us,
r
colors and shapes that occurring.  We
term this background or environment for the way life, living, and
self occur:  “mood.”  The occurring is in the foreground and the
d
mood is in the
d
background coloring and shaping the
d
occurring in
the foreground.  During the in-class sessions of the course we will
clarify and fully deal with what is introduced in this paragraph.  At
this point, the only thing there is to get about what is said in this
paragraph is that there is this something called “mood,” and mood
is distinct from and diff erent than what is meant by “clearing,” a
term you will encounter in the next section.
The “Fundamental and Essential Nature and
Function of Being for Human Beings” in Contrast
to One’s “Way of Being”
There is a difference between the fundamental and essential
nature of “being” for human beings, and any person’s individual
moment-to-moment particular “way of being.”
t
We are sometimes aware of our particular moment-to-mo-
ment way of being, but we human beings so take for granted
that we exist (that we
t
are), that we give no thought to the actual
nature and function of being for us human beings (unless it is to
think about the time when we won’t be at all).  As a result, getting
clear about the fundamental and essential nature and function of
being for human beings (as contrasted with our individual mo-
ment-to-moment way of being) will be somewhat challenging.
Being for human beings (that is, the fundamental and essen-
tial nature of being for human beings) is “being the clearing” (the
possibility, or something like, the emptiness or nothingness) in
which life, living, and self occur or
r
show up for us.  What shows up
in the clearing that we are is all of it, the entire “state of the world.”
All of it, our entire “state of the world”—includes physical objects
and non-physical entities of every kind (and their properties and
in various relationships), other people (and their properties and in
