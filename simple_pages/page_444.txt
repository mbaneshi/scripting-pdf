“I’ve exhausted all my reasons” is a reason. It doesn’t sound like a reason, but it’s a reason. And 
so the selection of chocolate was once again based on a reason. It was based on something; a
choice is based on nothing, except you saying so. Chocolate, vanilla: choose!
BILL
Vanilla.
KIPP
Perfect! Why did you choose vanilla?
BILL
I chose vanilla because I decided to...
(Kipp pulls out another tissue, wafting it will a string of “peeps”)”
Because I chose to.
KIPP
Okay, okay. Let’s check it out again. Chocolate or vanilla: choose!
BILL
Chocolate.
KIPP
Perfect! Why did you choose chocolate?
BILL (hesitating)
I have to use because?
KIPP
Yes. 
BILL (to laughter)r
I don’t see any way to develop from this.
KIPP
Right. You’re distinctioning something. You’re distinguishing something, and you’re doing
great. Chocolate or vanilla: choose!
BILL
Chocolate.
