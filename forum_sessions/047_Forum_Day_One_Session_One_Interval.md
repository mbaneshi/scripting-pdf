Forum Day One: Session One Interval

language “the house of Being” gives a “hint of the nature of language,” the scholar
immediately recognizes the danger: “I fear that to call your ‘house of Being’ a hint
might tempt you and me to elaborate the notion of hinting into a guiding concept in
which we then bundle up everything” (“DL” in OWL).  Heidegger concurs, but adds
that this error can “never be prevented in the sense of being totally excluded,” since
“the mode of conceptual representation insinuates itself all too easily into every
kind of human experience” (“DL” in OWL 25).
A relevant observation by the senior author: during my years of participation in
Erhard’s work, the distinguishing of distinctions has remained a source of fascina-
tion, challenge, and even mystery for me. I have observed conversations between
Forum leaders—people for whom the development of distinctions is central to their
professional practice—in which the speaking occurred to me as a kind of short-
hand. Elements of everyday interaction—details,  transitions, connections—seemed
to be missing. On one occasion, a statement by one Forum leader elicited this re-
sponse from another: “You’re explaining it. Distinguish it.” I found myself struggling
to recognize the difference being referred to.
An extensive hint at the nature of distinctions is found in Heidegger’s later work,
where he turned his attention increasingly to the ontological possibilities of art, and
specifically of poetry. Poetry, he said, is projective saying—that is, a kind of saying
which projects a clearing for Being by speaking the unspoken. “Projective saying
is saying which, in preparing the sayable, simultaneously brings the unsayable as
such into a world” (“OWA” in PLT 71). But such saying is not limited to the speaking
of the poet, because “Language itself is poetry in the essential sense” (“OWA” in PLT
72). Indeed, “everyday language is a forgotten and used-up poem, from which there
hardly resounds a call any longer” (“L” in PLT 205).
The thinker, says Heidegger elsewhere, confines his thinking to a single
thought (PLT 4). Heidegger’s single thought was the question of Being. A similar
single-mindedness characterizes the poet, and so Heidegger’s description of the
poet’s relation to the unsayable is useful:
Every great poet creates his poetry out of one single
poetic statement only. . . . The poet’s statement remains
unspoken. None of his individual poems, nor their totality,
says it all. Nonetheless, every poem speaks from the whole
of the one single statement, and in each instance says that
statement. (“LP” in OWL 160)
“
Therefore all of Heidegger’s writing and all of Werner Erhard’s work, as well as all the
poetry of Dickinson or Rilke or Wallace Stevens, may be seen as bodies of hints for
the Saying of what is essentially unsayable.

SPEAKING BEING
During the forty-minute break, statements had been written on two of the chalkboards. On one:
“Promise of The Forum: You can have anything out of The Forum that you are willing to stand for
having gotten.” On the second: “The commitment of the work is Transformation: bringing forth a
breakthrough in the possibility of being for human beings.”
As The Forum resumed, Erhard began with a question.
ERHARD
What happened when you were considering the diff erence between your story and what hap-
pened?
PARTICIPANT
I found that I didn’t want to confront my stories.
ERHARD
It’s possible to live in a kind of unconsciousness that we don’t ordinarily call unconsciousness
because we’re not knocked out. It’s an unconsciousness which appears as not being there. What
you can’t be with prevents you from being. If you mash up the what happens and the story, it
kind of keeps you a little unconscious, because you don’t have to be with it. But when you start
to distinguish the story from what happened, you begin to see the story as a story, and it’s not
very attractive that way, is it? And it’s something one would mostly avoid being with. There
will be a lot that will come up in here that you don’t want to be with. It’s useful to be with what
you don’t want to be with. What you’ve already learned to be with and survive with--that’s not
going to be very useful in here, it’s the part you’ve avoided being with here. Anything else?
Thanks very much.
As participants responded to this question, Erhard contextualized their contributions by expanding
the distinctions he had introduced earlier in the day.
JOHN
I’ve never really liked my wife’s version of the story of how we got married.
ERHARD
When you can recognize a person’s story as their story, you begin to have access to their version
of the story, so that you’re not stuck with, you don’t have to resign yourself to, their version of
the story. You have access to diff erent possibilities within the story, but not when it’s mashed up
with what happened.
JOHN
I got so upset, I left the room, and while I heard the story from another part of the house, my
upset turned toward wanting to get out of my marriage.
ERHARD  (interrupting)
You didn’t invent thinking about getting out of your marriage. That’s already always in the cul-
ture of being for human beings. You think, “oh well, this happened and that made me think I
