Forum Day Two: Session Three

MIKE
Yeah.
ERHARD
I want to acknowledge you for not pulling one bit of shit during the two conversations you’ve
had with me. You are an extraordinarily straight guy, who just had one racket: stupid, which
you now know is a racket. My business is that when you run the racket you’ll know it’s a racket.
Anything else to complete for you?
MIKE
No.
ERHARD
Thanks.
(applause as Mike sits)
(to the group)
All you’ve got to do is get it straight: my racket is, the cost is, the payoff  is. That’s all you got to
get. Just that.
(looking around)
Where is Angel? Stand up and tell me what you’ve made of this so far.
Angel, who had earlier interacted with Erhard about her divorce, rose.
ERHARD
What’s your racket? My racket is...
ANGEL
I’ve had a long time to think about this so I’m supposed to know, right?
ERHARD
You’re not supposed to know anything. What do you know? My racket is...
ANGEL
That I’m a victim.
ERHARD
Very good. Yeah. You’ve got this big stupid soap opera, this stuff . The truth is you’re a racke-
teer. The truth is you’ve got this racket about being a victim. That’s the truth. Not all this soap
opera... That’s a smoke screen for being a racketeer. Your racket is that you’re a victim. Yes?
146
SPEAKING BEING
ANGEL
Yes.
ERHARD
And what is the payoff  for being a victim? Take your time and look up there and say what the
payoff  is.
(pausing as Angel stares at the chalkboard
(
)
Puzzling, isn’t it?
ANGEL
I don’t know what I get to be right about. I get to be right about what?
ERHARD
About being sincere.
ANGEL
And deeply emotional and caring. You forgot about that.
ERHARD
Yeah, you’re not deeply emotional and caring or sincere. You’re a fucking racketeer. And the
racket is being a victim and the payoff  is that it makes you right. You’ve got this bullshit golden
calf called being deeply emotional and caring and being sincere. Being emotional and caring
and sincere is bullshit. This is not holy or sacred. I didn’t say it wasn’t nice. So, you’ve got this
racket called being a victim and it makes you right because if you weren’t a victim and you
weren’t suff ering, then you would be wrong, you would be invalidated, would you not?
ANGEL
Yes.
ERHARD
You would be invalidated as a caring, deeply emotional, sincere person.
ANGEL
That’s why your telling me that I don’t hurt over my divorce invalidates and hurts.
ERHARD
I understand. I understand. All I’m doing is getting you, what I call “up on the pike,” so we can
work together on something. Did you want to say something?
ANGEL
I say that what I want to get out of The Forum is a marriage that would, like, last forever, but
obviously what I’ve been about is making sure that I never can have that.
Forum Day Two: Session Three 147
ERHARD
But you don’t care about having a marriage that would last forever. All you care about is what
validates you as a caring, sincere, deeply feeling person.
ANGEL
That would do it.
ERHARD
Yeah exactly, but you see, you don’t care about being married. You really don’t care about being
married. You don’t. If God came into the room and said, if you dyed your hair purple, that
would make it clear to everyone that you are a deeply caring, sincere, feeling person, hell, you’d
be out there dyeing your hair purple. To hell with getting married. That’s your act. Your act is
that you’re sincere, deeply feeling, and a caring person. That’s an act with you. That’s not what
you are. Mike is not stupid. Mike has an act called “being stupid.”
ANGEL
So his father gave him his act.
ERHARD
No, no. He gave himself his act to deal with his father. Never mind that. Here’s what I want you
to get: Mike is not stupid. Mike’s got an act called being stupid. You don’t care. You’ve got an act
called “I care” and you’re not deeply feeling. That’s an act. And you’re not sincere. That’s also an
act.
ANGEL
I believe he’s not stupid.
ERHARD
And you don’t care. Now that’s not quite accurate. So listen up. It’s worse than that. I don’t
mean that you don’t care like “I don’t care.” I mean you are not caring. That’s an act. What you
call caring is a fucking act. Why are you afraid of not caring?
ANGEL
It would make me a bad person.
ERHARD
Who didn’t care?
ANGEL
It’s the opposite.
ERHARD
Who?
148
SPEAKING BEING
ANGEL
Who cares more than anyone I know?
ERHARD
Who’s that?
ANGEL
My mother.
ERHARD
Okay. What happened there? We haven’t made the connection yet. Did you decide you had to be
like your mother to survive? Oh, you didn’t care, right?
ANGEL
Right. My mom told me I didn’t care.
ERHARD
I got it. And?
ANGEL
And that’s what happened. My mom told me I didn’t care.
ERHARD
How old were you?
ANGEL
I was fi ve.
ERHARD
Good. So what does a fi ve year old... Take your time. Let yourself be with that. So you were a
fi ve-year-old little girl, and your mother told you that you didn’t care. Yeah?
ANGEL
Yeah. My mother took in foster children. And I felt unloved because she was giving them her
love and attention. She told me I was not being caring because I should care and understand
that they need it more than I do, and that I was being selfi sh.
ERHARD
Isn’t that a stupid fucking thing to tell a fi ve-year-old? Listen...
ANGEL
But she was helping somebody who really needed it, who didn’t have a mother or father, who...
Forum Day Two: Session Three
149
ERHARD
Horseshit! What do you mean really needed it? That’s all horseshit. They’re probably 10 times as
tough as you are. Probably needed a lot less than you did. But...irrelevant. You think a fi ve-year-
old is sophisticated enough to deal with that kind of logic?
ANGEL
I tried.
ERHARD
Is a fi ve-year-old sophisticated enough to deal with that kind of logic? You know what a fi ve-
year-old girl looks like?
ANGEL
Yeah, I do, I saw home movies over Christmas. I know exactly what I looked like.
ERHARD
A fi ve-year-old girl is pretty...not very worldly, huh? And also very caring, aren’t they?
ANGEL
Yes. But she told me I didn’t care.
ERHARD
Wait. We’re not back at fi ve now. We’re having a discussion up here for a moment and then we’ll
go back to fi ve. But I want you to look at a fi ve-year-old little girl and see that a fi ve-year-old girl
cares very deeply, and is not up to the logic “you don’t care” because if you’d care you would
know that these other children need more love and attention than you do. So you dealt with it
like a fi ve-year-old. What does a fi ve-year-old decide?
ANGEL
She was right.
ERHARD (raising voice)e
No! She decides she’s going to be the most caring person in the whole world!
ANGEL
Yes! Yes! Yes!
ERHARD
Like those magical bullshit fucking things that fi ve-year-old girls do, which is wonderful when
you’re a fi ve-year-old girl. You know, you decide, “I’m going to be the most caring person in the
whole world! No one’s going to care more than me.”
150
SPEAKING BEING
ANGEL
Right.
ERHARD
You became that like Mike became stupid. It wasn’t something you decided, it wasn’t something
you thought. You became that.
ANGEL
You want to hear something stupid? Being stupid isn’t good but being sensitive and caring is
good.
ERHARD
But listen up. You didn’t quite get what I said. You actually became, gave yourself an identity,
called caring. Whatever caring you had got buried under that identity. You became a caring ma-
chine. You became a caring robot. And whatever authentic caring you had, whatever authentic
feeling you had; that got obscured by the robot. You get what I’m saying? You know what it’s
like to be married to a robot? Not good. This is not a good thing. Being related to a fucking
robot. Particularly when the robot looks like they might be good for something else, like a real
relationship. Did you hear what I just said?
ANGEL
Yes.
ERHARD
That caring act will get you plenty of relatedness, but it will never fulfi ll itself.
ANGEL
Right. That’s why I could get married a million times, but I can’t stay.
ERHARD
Caring is very attractive. The only problem is it’s no fun to do it with a robot. And you’re a fuck-
ing robot. You know, like a doll. Like a caring doll. You push on the button that says “I care.” It’s
a lot of fun for a little while. But after a while it’s got to have some substance. You took a very
good thing and turned it into a mechanism.
(referring to Mike)
You see, he at least took something bad and turned it into a mechanism.
(laughter)r
He had a little better luck than you did. You took something really good and turned it into a
mechanism. So you know, his straightness, his authenticity leaks out around his act. But you
took caring and being, like really being there, and turned it into an act, and it obscures your
authentic caring and authentic feeling.
Forum Day Two: Session Three
151
ANGEL
So I’m inauthentic about caring.
ERHARD
Precisely. Now you have a great fucking act. It’s attractive, like bait.
Erhard sat on the edge of the platform, facing Angel. His tone was more forceful in this interaction
than it had been with Mike. Kipp again sat nearby.
ERHARD (continuing)
You attract people because you’re good at your act called caring. And you’re good at your act
called deeply feeling. So you get the fi sh up.
ANGEL
I was so good I believed it.
ERHARD
Exactly. See, underneath there is some kind of caring. I don’t know what the hell it is. Maybe
you care, I don’t know. That doesn’t interest me. I’ll tell you one thing. You’ll never be happy
being something you’re not, being your act. Ever. You’re never going to care enough, feel deeply
enough, to be happy, because none of that is who you are. And I don’t know what you are. You
may be caring. I don’t know. Neither do you. You only know what your act is. What there is to
get is that it’s an act. You’ve done a very good job of that standing there. And I know it isn’t easy.
You noticed how a lot of the stupidity for Mike started to go away near the end of that conver-
sation, interesting, right? Yeah. You want to relax for a little while; about this caring shit and
about being deeply feeling. You might want to enjoy yourself for a little while, having some fun
being shallow.
(laughter)r
See it doesn’t make any diff erence. This is a really important conversation because most of the
acts are going to look a little nasty. But a positive act is as detrimental as a negative one, in fact
it’s worse. She would have died like that. Shit. All the pain is pure bullshit, pure bullshit, noth-
ing authentic about the pain, not an iota of it. It’s all there to make you right. The pain’s not so
attractive anymore is it?
ANGEL
No.
ERHARD
What happened? You got divorced twice. Okay. That’s what happened, right? You got married.
Then you got divorced. You got married. Then you got
divorced. That’s all that happened. Not, “and I didn’t keep my vows, and nah nah nah nah.”
None of that ever happened.
152
SPEAKING BEING
ANGEL
Right.
ERHARD
When my dog walks up to you, and all he can tell is you smell good. That’s the whole story
about you for my dog. You’re starting to get how brutally stupid it’s been to waste your life feel-
ing badly about those stupid divorces. You know, you made a mistake. You know, I had seven
children. I never punished my children. I never decided on their punishment. In fact we never
talked about punishment. In life you do whatever you want, I’ve got certain rules. The rules are
not for you; they are for me. Don’t walk out in the street and get run over, I don’t want to see
you bloody. When you grow up you can do anything you want. When you’re around me don’t
get run over, I don’t want to see you bloody. You get run over there’s a consequence. When my
kids did something I would say, “You did it, good, now what’s the consequence?” “I shouldn’t
be allowed to eat for a week.”
(laughter)r
“Okay,” I would say, “I understand what you said, but we’re going to be a bit more lenient than
that.” Kids are nuts about punishing themselves. And you had a fi ve-year-old running her mar-
riage. You had to be the most caring person in the whole world. So when the marriage didn’t
work, like when I asked my kids what should happen to you because you did this, I should not
eat for a week. You had to make this enormous punishment for yourself.
ANGEL
Like I should not be happy for the rest of my life.
ERHARD
Precisely. Very good. I don’t want to see you cry any more about that. I want you to see how
stupid that is, how patently, brutally stupid. How old are you?
ANGEL
Thirty-two.
ERHARD
How old were you when you fi rst got married?
ANGEL
Twenty-one.
ERHARD
How old were you when you got divorced fi rst?
ANGEL
Twenty-fi ve.
Forum Day Two: Session Three
153
ERHARD
Okay. How long have you been suff ering and unhappy?
ANGEL
From what?
ERHARD
From the divorce. Did it take the second divorce?
ANGEL
Yeah. The suff ering and unhappiness was in the marriage.
ERHARD
But you put up with it.
ANGEL
I put up with a lot.
ERHARD
And that was good because somebody who cares more than anybody else in the world will put
up with a lot of shit. So it made you right to suff er in your marriage. Made you a good person.
You know what doormats attract?
ANGEL
People who step on them.
ERHARD
Exactly. You got it. And you know what? A doormat keeps a person who wants to wipe his
feet stuck to the doormat. You dominated him just as sure as I’m sitting on this platform. You
dominated him by being the victim. Now, he had his racket as well—two racketeers rubbing up
against each other.
ANGEL
We had a great game.
ERHARD
It’s disgusting.
ANGEL
I couldn’t play without him.
ERHARD
Right.
