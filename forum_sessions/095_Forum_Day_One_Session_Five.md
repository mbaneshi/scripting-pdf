Forum Day One: Session Five

PARTICIPANT
I noticed I was really exhausted.
KIPP
So what you just did was unconceal a fundamental condition that human
beings are. I asked you to sit in your chair and think about what’s happening
right now, and what did you do? By the time you get around to describing
what’s happening right now, it’s gone. Yet everybody stood up authentically,
honestly, and described what happened then but said it was what is now.
There’s no description available for now. So you’ve got to have the representa-
tion. But what’s present is clearly distinct from the representation. And what it
is to be a human being is not to have that distinction. This is what happened at
the party before you got here. The domains of presence and representation got
collapsed. The moment you say what was happening is what is happening, the
representation starts to shape the presence.
ERHARD
What’s the diff erence between now and your representation of now? You
can never describe presence because there’s no description in the realm of
presence. If this isn’t making sense, don’t worry. The valuable stuff  in here
will not make sense. But it’s valid. “Make sense” means “fi ts with what you
already know.” To get what doesn’t make sense requires thinking. What Kipp
is trying to get you to get is that you don’t make any distinction between love
as a presence and love as a story. Is there anybody in the room who can’t see
that existence as a presence is diff erent from existence as a concept or repre-
sentation?
(pausing)
Life exists in the world of concepts and life exists in the world of presence.
But that’s misleading, because the two get collapsed. Something happens,
like a “what happened.” And that devolves into a concept. What happened
back then is never present like a presence. But that’s not clear to you. You
think you’re dealing with what happened when what you’re really dealing
with is your story about what happened. One is not better than the other.
The problem is when they get mixed together. This creates a vicious circle:
the concept of your previous experience now becomes a fi lter for your next
experience, which is now a little less free because it is conceptually shaped.
The conceptually shaped experience reinforces the concept; the reinforced
concept more fully shapes the experience. I’m trying to drive out this seven-
ties bullshit that there’s something wrong with your head. I’m an anti-human
potentialist. I’m not saying that you’re stuck in the concept. I’m saying that
you’re stuck in the vicious circle. I don’t want questions. I want to know:
“Did you get that?”
(pausing)
Good. Everybody got that. So now we’re going to demonstrate what happens
when you’ve got that distinction. Once you get a distinction, it uses you. Three
distinctions to get: one is the realm of existence called presence. The second is
the realm of existence called concept or representation. The third is the vicious
circle. The vicious circle is constructed by a collapse of the fi rst two domains.
(pausing)
We’re going to play a new game. We’re going to do a survey. How many of you
are tired?
(a majority of participants raised their hands)
How many of you have a headache?
(calling on a young woman named Diane)
Would you be willing to participate in a demonstration? Then please come up
here onto the platform.
Diane sat in the second director’s chair that an assistant placed alongside the fi rst.
ERHARD
Would you be willing to have your headache disappear?
DIANE
Yes.
ERHARD
And would you be willing to not know why it disappeared?
DIANE
Okay.
ERHARD
Please close your eyes. How long have you had your headache?
DIANE
Since before the dinner break.
ERHARD
How big is it?
(hesitating, she holds hands outstretched)
Where is it located?
(pointing to her left temple)
What color is it?
82
SPEAKING BEING
DIANE (hesitating)
Brown.
ERHARD
If it had a geometric shape, what would it be?
DIANE
Triangular.
ERHARD
How much water would it hold?
DIANE
About a pint.
ERHARD
On a scale of one to ten, where is it?
DIANE
Six and a half.
ERHARD
Why do you have it?
DIANE
Because it’s been a long day.
ERHARD
Headache and long day live in diff erent realms. You have collapsed them. So,
why do you have a headache?
DIANE
Because I’ve been sitting still.
ERHARD
So you’ve got two domains collapsed. Every time I ask you that stupid question
“Why?” it collapses the two domains.
(repeating this series of questions several times)
How’s your headache now?
DIANE
It’s a four.
ERHARD
How much water would it hold?
DIANE
Still a pint.
ERHARD
It’s critically important that you get it. The headache now and the headache
a moment ago are collapsed together. When she says the headache is “still” a
pint, I know she has collapsed the headache now with the representation of
the headache then.
(continuing to question her regarding the headache’s shape, color and location
right now)
Do you have a headache?
DIANE
No, I don’t.
ERHARD (to the group)
What happened was, I asked her questions which in order to answer she had
to be in the presence of her headache like a presence.
DIANE
I focused on it.
ERHARD
No! What happened was you got the domains uncollapsed. All that happened
was that the headache, instead of showing up in the vicious circle, showed up
distinct in the domain of presence. You looked at your headache. You were
present to the headache. There are no reasons when the headache is like a
presence.
A second demonstration followed with Patricia, a participant who said she was
tired. She sat in one of the director’s chairs; Erhard sat on the arm of his, facing
her.
ERHARD
How tired are you on a scale from one to ten?
