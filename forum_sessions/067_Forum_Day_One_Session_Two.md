Forum Day One: Session Two

ERHARD
Did you get that he doesn’t agree with that?
JAKE
We’re not exactly aligned.
ERHARD
I understand that. Jake, you’re not exactly aligned from exactly the same place.
(addressing the two men)
You’re both nutty about your word. He’s coming from the same thing. If you thought it was gold
t
and you stamped gold on it, then it’s really gold. You hear how stupid that sounds?
JAKE
Yeah.
ERHARD
That’s what you said.
JAKE
I didn’t say that.
ERHARD (indicating Paul)
That’s what he said. Pretty stupid what he said, isn’t it? If you thought it was gold and you
t
stamped gold on it, then it’s really gold. That’s what really counts, what you intended. Right?
JAKE
It doesn’t make it authentic, but it doesn’t make me dishonest. It doesn’t make me a liar either.
ERHARD  (to the group)
I’m taking all this time with this bullshit because I want to accomplish something. No mat-
ter what I bring up, somebody will have a thing about it. Somebody will be nutty about it. No
matter what they’re saying, it’s obvious these two guys are intelligent. But they’ve got their foot
nailed to the fl oor, so it’s like talking to stupid people. Being stuck makes you stupid. There’s no
power available where you’ve got your foot nailed to the fl oor. All this conversation regarding
intention, in response to my simple statement about authenticity, indicates that there’s some
nuttiness there. The point is, at some point, you will be that person.
(to Jake)
And to settle this conversation: I ask you to stand in—that a person who presents himself one
way, and in fact acts another way, for any reason, is inauthentic. That’s not true. It’s a “take the
case that” I’m asking you to stand in. Is that clear?

SPEAKING BEING
Jake nodded and then sat down.
ERHARD (to Paul)
Did you get what I said to him?
PAUL
Yeah, so, what you’re saying is that specifi c instance you didn’t do what you said, you’re inau-
thentic, and I would agree with you there, but...
ERHARD
I don’t want your agreement. I want you to create this square.
(drawing an imaginary square on the fl oor in front of Paul)
Inside that square is a diff erent world. Inside that world, when you act one way and present
yourself another way, that’s inauthentic.
PAUL
Specifi cally, or generally?
ERHARD
Generally. Just in that world. It’s not true in the rest of the world. Can you handle that?
PAUL
Yeah. I’m not sure what it applies to, but...
ERHARD
It doesn’t apply to anything. Can you handle that?
PAUL
Yeah.
ERHARD
Stand in that square and listen to what I say next. Because only standing there will what I’m
about to say make any sense. All right? You ready to stand in that square?
(to Paul)
You ready? So in that little square, I know it’s not true, and it’s not that way in the rest of the
world, and for those for whom one and one is two, when you pretend to be one way and act
another, that’s called inauthentic. When you own up to this, that’s being authentic about your
inauthenticity. Anybody not get that? That’s the beginning of authenticity. Authenticity does not
AUTHENTICITY
Here Erhard provides a counterintuitive, but very Heideggerian
premise: authenticity is possible only with the development
of an authentic relationship with our own inauthenticity. Here
authenticity is an act of ownership, of owning the calculative
clearing which we are, of accepting the particular gift  of Being
whose sending characterizes our epoch. Heidegger introduced
this idea in Being and Time, where he employed the term
“resoluteness” to characterize Dasein’s state of having-
appropriated; he described this resoluteness as an empowering
authenticity toward one’s own inauthenticity:
Resoluteness appropriates untruth authen-
tically. Dasein is already in irresoluteness,
and soon, perhaps, will be in it again. . . . The
irresoluteness of the “they” remains domi-
nant, notwithstanding, but it cannot impugn
resolute existence. (BT 345)
“
This idea lies at the heart of the appropriative event: in
the context of having appropriated one’s inauthenticity, that
inauthenticity, which persists, is nevertheless transformed.
It is an idea which defies our usual thinking: ontically, such a
“transformation” can only be seen as blatant self-justification, a
philosophically sophisticated rationalization for accepting one’s
worst nature. Ontologically, however, appropriation justifies
nothing. Appropriation appropriates; it gives Being. Resoluteness,
then, is “the opening up of human being, out of its captivity in
that which is, to the openness of Being” (“OWA” in PLT 67). Much
of The Forum is devoted to developing the possibility of a non-
justificatory event of appropriation. ■
