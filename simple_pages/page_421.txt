Forum Day Four: Session Two 
407
TIM
Some.
WES
No, all of them! When they’re solutions. Take a look. It’s a very nasty trap. What’s a very big 
problem for somebody in high school? 
TIM
Zits.
(laughter)r
WES
Yeah but only because zits mean something: That’s the real problem. 
TIM
Yes.
WES
If all the models had zits, zits would be good. What does that mean?
TIM
Looking good.
WES
Getting a boyfriend, getting a girlfriend, and getting laid. Have you forgotten?
(laughter)r
Grades too, but we’ll talk about getting laid because it’s more fun.
(laughter)r
So that’s the big problem. Look back at your life and look at teenagers and see what it’s all
about. It was about getting a girlfriend, getting a boyfriend, and getting laid, and also getting
laid with the right one. So, many people immediately solved that problem right out of high
school. What did they do?
TIM
They get married. And then they’ve got a new problem.
WES
That becomes the next problem. Aren’t marriages that solve problems the next problem? I didn’t 
say marriages are a problem. Listen carefully. Marriage is not a problem. Marriage is marriage.
