Forum Day One: Session Two
43
ERHARD
I apologize.
PARTICIPANT
Yeah, sure.
ERHARD
Is that like “fuck you”? Do you mean “I don’t feel apologize”? I’m not my feelings. I’m my 
mouth. You’re not your mouth. You say “okay” when you mean “Fuck you.”
PARTICIPANT
Not always.
ERHARD
You did that time.
PARTICIPANT 
That’s true.
Throughout this interaction Erhard’s style was relaxed but direct.
ERHARD (to the group)
The truth is that whether you keep your word depends on how you feel. Create this possibility: 
that you present yourself as someone who keeps your word, but in fact does or does not depend-
ing on whether you feel like it. Try on that possibility. “Honor your promise” means something 
like keep them in spite of the circumstances. Try on this possibility: that you present yourself as
f
someone who keeps your word, but in fact are someone who does or does not keep your word 
depending on whether you feel like it. Try that on. I say that if you do that you will have the 
freedom to honor your word. I know more about lying than most people in this room. I’ve lied 
more than most people in this room, and I know the kind of life it gives. And it’s my observation
that you’re never going to be able to honor your word until you can be with yourself in the way 
in which I just accused you of being. I say that until you can be with that, you can’t honor your 
word. By the way, I want to introduce a phrase here: that would be called being authentic about 
being inauthentic. Who doesn’t get this?
MARY 
I know that sometimes I won’t keep my word.
ERHARD
But you don’t present yourself as that.
