Forum Day Four: Session Two
401
WES
But there’s no problem yet. See “I’m sixty pounds more that I want to be” is not a problem.
That’s “sixty pounds more than I want to be.”
DONALD
That’s right. I spoke that. I languaged that. So if I wanted to weigh 235 pounds, and I weighed
235 pounds, I’d be happy, because that’s how much I wanted to weigh.
WES
No. I don’t know that you’d be happy.
DONALD
Because I said so.
WES
No. That’s just how much you would weigh.
DONALD
There wouldn’t be a problem there.
WES
Not yet. If you weighed what you weighed, there’s no problem.
DONALD
It’s a problem...
WES
If you weigh what you weigh and you shouldn’t weigh that, then there’s a problem. Or you’re
on a diet and it’s not working fast enough and that shouldn’t be. Or you try and it doesn’t work
and it should have worked.
DONALD
But if I wanted to weigh 235 pounds and I weigh 235 pounds...
WES
The fi rst step is to say to your problem called “your weight” that “in life there are problems,” not
“the problem about my weight shouldn’t be. I shouldn’t have a problem with my weight.”
DONALD
That’s what I’m saying: “I shouldn’t have a problem about my weight.”

SPEAKING BEING
WES
No it’s more like “I shouldn’t have the problem ‘weight.’”
DONALD
I shouldn’t have the problem “weight,” I should be more like Ron.
(indicating person sitting next to him who looks more fi t than Donald)
WES
No.
(laughter)r
That you have problems, is wrong. You’d be better off  without your problems, right Donald?
DONALD
Yeah.
WES
That’s what we’re dealing with.
DONALD
Oh, I’ve got it.
WES
You wouldn’t be better off  without your problems, because if have life, you’ll have problems.
DONALD
I got it.
WES
The whole group “problems” has opened up. We haven’t dealt with the specifi c problem called
weight.
DONALD
I got it.
WES
You can stand with your problems like “acceptance,” or even more than acceptance.
DONALD
Recognition.
