Forum Day Three: Session One

SPEAKING
BEING
DAY THREE
Day three of The Forum began at 9:00 am, with The Forum leader, Kipp, on the platform asking
participants to share about the assignment from the previous evening: to share their experience of
The Forum with someone in their lives.
KIPP
When you talk about what happened, people are left, and you’re left, with whatever description
gives you. We’re going to call that domain of speaking “up in the stands.” Does talking to the
person next to us about what’s down on the court impact the game? Now I’m asking you to get
on the court and share from being on the court. Here’s how it starts: “Who were you with?”
“You said what?” “What did they say?”
Wearing a dark gray sweater-vest with black slacks, Erhard appeared in the back of the room,
watching the interaction.
BETTY
I phoned my brother last night, and I told him, in the beginning of him harassing me to make a
decision of being here, that I wasn’t sure of... that I blamed him...
KIPP
You said you blamed him?
BETTY
I said I blamed him. This is the conversation that we had. “I blamed you Bob for me being here
because I didn’t want to be here. It’s your fault and I hate you for it.”
KIPP (to the group)
You’re right there with her because she’s not talking about sharing, she’s sharing. You’re right
there on the phone with her. Then what did you tell him?
BETTY
I told him that I was sorry for how I felt, that I had no right to feel that way, that I was the one
who was wrong and selfi sh.
KIPP
And he said?
BETTY
He said that he loved me, and that the reason that he wanted me here was because it would be
good for me. And I told him that I didn’t want to see it from his point of view; to see it from my
point of view, and it took me to get through yesterday to realize that. I got through that point.
I realized it. I’m here. It’s great for me. And I told him that I appreciated him for making that
decision for harassing me.
FORUM DAY THREE

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
Whether it’s convincing you or harassing you, neither ever happened. In the sense of what
happened, your brother spoke to you.
BETTY
In a sense it didn’t and in another sense it did.
KIPP
It’s called describing it. He spoke to you.
(to the group)
What she just shared with you just about never happens after two days of anything in your life.
This isn’t a new situation; this is, however, many years between her and her brother and two
days. It’s hard to be present to that; it’s hard to see because it seems like two years.
BETTY
I hated being here the fi rst two days.
KIPP
No you didn’t... You had those thoughts. Did you have anything to do with any of those
thoughts?
BETTY
No.
KIPP
No. It was like the rain.
BETTY
It was like the rain.
KIPP
Stop identifying with the rain.
ERHARD (entering the conversation)
He’s making a slightly diff erent point, and it would be useful for everybody to get it. That’s not
you thinking. The stuff  going on in your head is not yours. It doesn’t belong to you. You didn’t
invent it, or generate it. It’s thoughts you’re having. I want you to be able to think that what’s
going on when you’re thinking is not you thinking. You’re having thoughts. It thinks. I’m having
the thoughts it thinks. In the book, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat—there was such
a man—he actually thought his wife was a hat. And you mistake it thinking for you thinking.
Not you personally. People mistake it thinking for them thinking just like the guy who mistook
his wife for a hat. You have to do some thinking to get that. It thinks, and you have the thoughts
that it thinks. You want to stop being so entangled in your thinking. You want to be able to
IN-ORDER-TO
Here Erhard is characterizing the current clearing for Being as
calculative—as technological—wherein everything is placed in
reserve, standing by, ready to be used—everything including our
selves (please see the series of sidebars on technology during the
third and final session of Day Four). Since we have not recognized
the technological clearing as a paradigm, a particular way of being
which we have been sent, we see it as simply the way things—
including our selves—are. The in-order-to of standing-reserve, not
Forum Day Three: Session One

stand back a bit and watch it think. You think you’re limited to what it thinks. But that’s it
thinking. It has thought you into a lot of pain and suff ering, unhappiness, and dissatisfaction.
And it has a purpose, like a machine. It is designed in-order-to. It is not designed in order
to leave you with love, fulfi llment, and full self-expression. Have you got any idea what it’s
designed in-order-to? It’s designed in order to make you look good. That’s its design function.
(in the aisle among the group)
And it uses thinking and feeling, interpretations, what you believe to be true, in order to make
you look good. It utilizes and organizes those elements and generates those elements in a form
designed to make you look good. What does it mean to look good? Well, specifi cally, it means
to make you right and others wrong, to foster your dominating and to avoid the domination
of anything else. And it uses your thinking and your feelings, and your perceptions and your
interpretations, conclusions, etc., to justify yourself; except yourself and it have become one.
You have identifi ed with it. You are an it; you are an anybody. What makes you an anybody
is you identify with it. You identify with its thinking and its feeling, and that makes you an
anybody, and the costs are love, happiness, and self-expression. It thinks and you have its
thoughts, and it thinks in order to make you look good, and what it costs you to identify with it
is love, happiness, vitality, and self-expression.
BETTY
I think the thing that hit me the strongest was the racket. When I could identify my racket and
my reason for allowing things to take place in my life and receive the cost that I received from it,
was the identifi cation of breaking through the barrier of all of this. I felt like this ton of bricks
was lifted from my shoulders, being able to acknowledge that. And I realize what I was doing...
ERHARD
See—hold on. It doesn’t think like that. What she’s speaking doesn’t have anything to do with
looking good, does it? As a matter of fact if you were real concerned with looking good you
would never say what she just said. You can’t say what she just said without thinking, because it
might make you look bad. Go on.
BETTY
I realized the cost that I was paying for the racket I was having.
ERHARD
Running. You run a racket.
BETTY
The racket I was running. In allowing myself to be used for acceptance.
ERHARD
Kipp and I may have to go home and let her do this. That’s extraordinarily powerful to
recognize that your life doesn’t belong to you. That it’s using your life for its purposes. And its
confronted as the “it” which we have been sent, becomes “us.”
The “giant cybernetic system,” to use Hubert Dreyfus’ s phrase,
has thereby been set in motion: “We don’t produce the clearing.
The clearing produces us” (“Gaining a Free Relationship to
Technology,” Applied Heidegger Conference).
We have become both the “it” which acts in-order-to, and, as
the they-self/identity, one of those entities which is subject to the
in-order-to of the “it.” Erhard has summarized the result of this
system:
“
When you are that you are the identity “I”—when
you are that you are that—and you couple that
with what “it” is up to, you get a very powerful
look into how this what-it’s-up-to is translated
into our everyday way of Being-in-the-world,
into our everyday engagement with our everyday
concerns. What “it” is concerned with, once
you are that you are it. . . what “it” is up to is
making you right. . . and making anything else by
contrast wrong. (“The Heart of the Matter”)
In Being and Time, the in-order-to is also shown by Heidegger
to be a central element of the existential structure of Dasein. As we
have shown elsewhere, Dasein is always in the world in such a way
that it is concerned about things—getting them done, producing
d
them, giving them up, considering them, and so forth (BT 83–84,
T
96)—and our understanding of the world is mediated through
these concerns (see the sidebar “Concern” during Session Four
of Day One). Heidegger calls the things we encounter in this way
equipment, and in-order-to is a characteristic of equipment:
“
Equipment is essentially ‘something in-order-
to. . . .’ A totality of equipment is constituted
by various ways of the ‘in-order-to,’ such
as serviceability, conduciveness, usability,
manipulability. [. . .] Dealings with equipment
subordinate themselves to the manifold
assignments of the ‘in-order-to.’ (BT 97, 98)

SPEAKING BEING
purposes are looking good--all that stuff  up on the board specifi cally--that’s what looking good
looks like: being right, making other people and other things wrong, dominating, avoiding
domination, justifying yourself and invalidating others, and other things. When you come to see
that that’s what your life is being used for, you’ve gotten pretty close to the source of your self.
You’ve gotten pretty close to the source of your identity. Pretty close to the source of that with
which you’ve confused your self. Go on.
BETTY
He was right that I allow myself to be used for acceptance. That was the cost that I was paying.
I didn’t enjoy the cost I was receiving. I made them wrong to be right when I was the one who
was wrong.
KIPP
Even though she didn’t enjoy the cost she was receiving, it was familiar. And what you call
comfortable is what is familiar, what you are used to. She doesn’t know now how to relate to her
brother. She knows how to relate to him before: make him wrong. But now she has to be in the
presence of the risk...
ERHARD
She’s got to make up a relationship with her brother. That’s called “invent.” She’s got to invent a
relationship with her brother. Another word for that is “create”: create a relationship with her
brother. You want to think about that a little bit: The possibility of living life as a creative act,
where you don’t have an answer when you stand in front of the canvas. What you’ve got is an
empty canvas, possibility. You create something in the empty space of not knowing how to be
there already. Knowing how to be there already is nothing more than the past coming around to
meet you in the future. Sure she knows how to relate to her brother that way she’s always been.
That’s comfortable. It’s uncomfortable to stand in front of an empty canvas. It’s uncomfortable
because you’re at risk. You might make a fool of yourself. You might be conned. You might get
taken advantage of. You don’t like that, visit the surgeon and get a lobotomy.
BETTY
It doesn’t just stop at my brother.
ERHARD
Obviously it doesn’t stop at your brother. Somebody who says “I hate, I hate, I hate”—that is
“disgruntled and unhappy” waiting-to-happen. Suppose she doesn’t have this as a way to start
every morning? Suppose she doesn’t have that as a way to walk into work? She’ll have to create
a way to walk into work, and create a way to walk into her relationships with her family, and
create a way to walk into relationships with men in her life—instead of being sour to start with
before anything happens.
BETTY
I stay sour constantly.
referentiality, a frame of reference for our understanding—a
“towards-which” for all of our/its dealings in the world. And the
primary towards-which, says Heidegger, is always the “for-the-
sake-of-which” that Dasein itself is: “the ‘for-the-sake-of’ always
pertains to the Being of Dasein, for which, in its Being, that very
Being is essentially an issue” (BT 116–117). My concerns and my
T
actions always circle back to my own Being, always defined by
the in-order-to: “In so far as Dasein exists factically, it understands
itself in the way its ‘for-the-sake-of-itself’ is thus connected with
some current ‘in-order-to’” (BT 416).
T
One of The Forum’s central purposes is the unconcealment
of the in-order-to, which is the design function of the “it”—the
calculative thinking which characterizes the technological clear-
ing. Erhard has pointed out that recognizing his own thrownness
to in-order-to was central in the development of his thinking.
During his 1971 experience of ontological insight, from which the
est Training was generated, he says:
t
“
I realized that I actually didn’t know anything. Ev-
erything that I knew had a tag on it, and the name
of the tag was “in order to.” So I knew this in order
to, I knew that in order to, et cetera. Everything
t
was somehow a part of a story about how it was
going to advance me or how it could be used, or
how it could benefit people, or whatever it might
be. Nothing lived on its own. (Simon  37)
As we will show in the closing Interval for Day Four of The Forum,
the danger of the technological clearing, for Heidegger, is that we
are oblivious to its nature and are thus denied access to the truth
of aletheia: “Through [the technological destining of enframing]
the other possibility is blocked,” said Heidegger, that human
being “might rather be admitted sooner and ever more primally
to the essence of what is unconcealed and to its unconcealment
[aletheia]” (“QCT” in BW 331).

ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day Three: Session One
175
ERHARD
See, look. If she won the Nobel Prize that would be less important to her life than what she just
said. There’s nothing more important for her to say. Because once she can own that, there’s a
possibility beyond that. And until she can own that, there’s no possibility beyond that. All there
is, is shucking and jiving around that: one ploy after another ploy—trying not to be that way, to
fi nding out you are that way, giving in to being that way, making up your mind to be some other
way, trying not to be that way, fi xing being that way—it’s all a trap like having your foot nailed
to the fl oor and running around real fast.
BETTY
I’m going to fi x it.
KIPP
What do you mean by that? Because it’s going to be misheard.
BETTY
I’m going to fi x it by acknowledging my racket. When my racket goes to swing I’m going to
stop it. Because I’m not going to allow myself to pay the costs, just for me to be right and make
everyone wrong. Feel what I’m feeling. I’m going to take full control of it.
ERHARD
Most of that’s pretty good. A little “fi x it” in there; a little “stop it” in there. Most of it is
responsibility for it. And to the degree that she can be responsible for it, to the degree she can
be with it—be with it and be responsible for it—these words are synonymous, by the way—to the
degree that she can be responsible for it, to that degree she’s not limited to it. It’s not going to
go away. That’s who she is. That’s the identity she’s built for herself. It’s gonna be there forever.
And to the degree she can be with that, there’s a possibility beyond that. We’re too far into today
now, so I’m going to stop talking like that.
KIPP
What you’re present to is the distinction sharing. There’s no manipulation, no in-order-to.
That’s what sharing sounds like. This is what The Forum is about. So if you’re sitting in your
chair, if you’re with whatever’s happening in her life with yours, if there’s a harmony, if it
strikes a chord, then you should know that’s what this work is about. If you fi nd yourself in her
speaking—if you fi nd yourself in your life in her life—that’s what we’re doing here. Out of her
generosity—the truth is, out of her getting off  it—that’s what it sounds like when someone’s
getting off  it. She had no life. What she had was hate and resentment and bitterness, and
hate and resentment and bitterness were winning. We’re going to continue to distinguish this
distinction “sharing.”
SUSAN
I didn’t think you’d call on me.
Similarly, for Erhard, it is the in-order-to of the technological
clearing which diminishes our experience of truth:
“
. . .if you take something which is true and add
to it an “in order to” or even a “because” or
a “therefore,” you’ve changed it. And you’ve
changed it so dramatically that it’s no longer the
truth. It’s the truth used for something—to prove
d
something, to coerce others, to be right or make
someone else wrong. The truth used like that isn’t
the truth any more. It’s closer to a lie—something
pretending to be the truth. (Simon, ibid. 38, em-
phasis added)
Here we find ourselves in another instance of the reflexive thinking
that characterizes the work of both Erhard and Heidegger: even
attempts to escape in-order-to are undertaken in order to escape
in-order-to. Consequently, much of The Forum is devoted to the
distinction of a possibility beyond in-order-to. As Forum leader
Roger Armstrong told the Openings participants during this 1989
Forum, “To do one thing that’s not in-order-to” could be worth the
entire four days of The Forum. The paradox—embedded deeply in
Heidegger’s central distinction, appropriation—is that one can get
beyond in-order-to only by allowing and owning the inevitability of
in-order-to. ■

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
That’s what you get for thinking.
SUSAN
Well I called my husband last night, and he’s the one I thought had forced me to do it.
KIPP
Let’s get a little more rigorous. You had the thought...
SUSAN
Right. We were recently married in October. He participated in The Forum a couple of months
ago. When he came back from it he was so excited and he was great. He was excited about
our relationship—which was wonderful. But what really bothered me was that he said it was
because of The Forum. And that bugged me. My husband told me the reason he married me
was because of The Forum. That is a bunch of garbage; “You married me because you love me,
and there’s nobody who is making you marry me.” I went to Forum Introductory meetings and
didn’t like it because they wanted to work on me.
KIPP
No, you didn’t like it because you’re a creep.
SUSAN
Right. Yesterday I was sitting in here, and all these people have these major problems. I don’t
see a major problem in my life. And then I said, “my gosh, that’s one right there.”
KIPP (to the group)
That’s big. Some of you haven’t gotten here yet. Slow group.
SUSAN
As I developed it in my mind, I realized I got to share this, and so I put my hand up. “Now what
if he calls on me? I have to make sure I got this all planned out to say it right.” Then I realized:
I’m terrifi ed.
KIPP
That’s the point. The rest was fi ll. Keep going, please.
SUSAN
The thing that I came into The Forum to accomplish was to have the ability to fi nd the right
position. I just moved up here, and I don’t have a job yet. I wanted to wait until after the
holidays...
KIPP
Wait. What’s true is you don’t have a job yet.
Forum Day Three: Session One
177
SUSAN
That’s right. I’m afraid I’m not going to fi nd the right position. I told him about my racket, that
“I’m right only when it matters to you that you’re right. It doesn’t matter if either way is okay.
But if you’re adamant about being right, then I want to be right.”
KIPP
It’s called new love. It’s a new marriage.
SUSAN
Anyway. Very diffi  cult for me.
KIPP
But that’s the important part. How diffi  cult it is. Everything that you call yourself is going to
fi ght against it. Every justifi cation in the world is going to be there to shut up.
SUSAN
I was afraid that I would lose footing.
KIPP
That’s right. Marriage isn’t about loving, about being at risk: it’s about dominating and winning.
SUSAN
I thought I didn’t want to dominate. I just didn’t want to be dominated.
ERHARD (entering the conversation)
Thanks for this Susan. Very useful conversation. Dominating and avoiding domination are two
sides of the same mirror. It doesn’t mean be a patsy either. There’s an alternative to dominating and
avoiding domination. There’s a possibility beyond that. And it’s not possible to see that until you
see what it costs you to dominate or avoid domination. Most marriages are about dominating and
avoiding domination. They’re about being right and avoiding being wrong. That’s what marriages
are really about. They’re not about the stuff  they put in the fairy tales. And they’re always going to
be about that because you and I didn’t make that up, we inherited that when we became human
beings. And it’s only to the degree that you can own that, for there to be a possibility beyond that.
What you’re doing now, looking at that and owning that, taking it on and seeing that that’s what
owns your marriage: that starts to create the possibility of some power in the marriage.
(pausing)
The other thing is, you want to be able to get to the point where you can be with what people
say. Otherwise you’re going to be manipulated by what people say. See, whatever your husband
said about The Forum: stupid. But you couldn’t be with it; it took your being away from you.
SUSAN
He used a lot of the terminology that you used, and that drove me nuts because he acted kind of
smug. You know he had found “it.” I hadn’t, so I had to go get “it.”
“
There’s an alternative to dominating and
avoiding domination. There’s a possibility
beyond that. And it’s not possible to see
that until you see what it costs you to
dominate or avoid domination.
178
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Yes. That’s the smell of enlightenment. You want to keep your enlightenment to yourself and
not let the smell out. What you want to share with people is empowerment, not enlightenment.
You want to watch doing enlightenment with people, and it’s possible to empower people.
If someone says something stupid to you—I’m not telling you how to handle this, I’m just
illustrating that there’s a way to be with it—if somebody says something stupid to you, you can
say, “okay, I understand exactly what you’re saying.” That gives you much more of an opening
than “that’s stupid.” I don’t talk like this outside of here. I don’t use all this jargon outside of
here. I use it in here because there’s a reason to. Now, you’re going to be stupid. You’re going
to use all the terminology inappropriately. And there’s not much you can do about it. It’s hard
not to. If we could take it back before you left here, we would, so you would just be left with
yourself. All this stuff  in here is not signifi cant. The only thing signifi cant is you. And you can
work your way through those things with your husband now that you’re hip to what’s going
on. It’s a pretty exciting thing to think about the possibility of marriage beyond the games in
marriages.
KIPP
So in sharing with your husband last night, you said?
SUSAN
I said “I’m sorry I was such a twit about signing up.”
ERHARD
A twit?
SUSAN
It’s softer language for me.
ERHARD
You cleaned it up for television.
KIPP
And he said?
SUSAN
He said “That’s all right, I love you.”
KIPP
And what was left? What were you then standing in?
SUSAN
Standing in my own decision.
“
If we could take it back before you left
here, we would, so you would just be left
with yourself. All this stuff  in here is not
significant. The only thing significant
is you.
Forum Day Three: Session One
179
ERHARD
And standing in the love that was there. Not a bad place to stand—talking about power. What
you call love is not love: it’s love in-order-to; love to keep somebody around; or love to get
something out of them; love because you need. That’s not love. When you take everything
else away, what is left is love. When you take away “I was a twit,” and take away him being
arrogant, what you’re left with is love for each other. And it doesn’t mean anything, but it’s
extraordinarily powerful. And you can stand there and really make something happen in life—
like really create something worth creating. Fabulous.
SUSAN
During dinner last night I was expressing things that had bothered me before, and he said, “I
think it should be a requirement for spouses, that when one takes it the other should take
The Forum.”
ERHARD
We like it to get bad fi rst, though. Makes it clearer about what you’re up to if it gets bad fi rst.
SUSAN
I know because listening to everybody else yesterday, things they wanted to fi x, and I didn’t
think I had anything--I just haven’t lived long enough.
ERHARD
You know, we do this with children. They’re as fucked up as you are. They’ve got all the same
stuff  as you going on and they’re in the process of building their identity. And I’m probably one
of the few people in the world who’s an expert on teenagers. And I know almost nothing about
teenagers. The truth about teenagers is that they’re human. People are insulted when I say that.
But when you live with a teenager, you’re not sure.
(laughter)
The truth is that teenagers are adults. That’s hard to get, because they’re a weird kind of adult.
They’re adults who don’t have their act together well enough to get it bought all the time. And
it’s very painful to get called on your act. Very painful. Adults are teenagers with their act so
well put together that they almost never get called on it. Very simple and very powerful.
SUSAN
I see that as I was looking for a job I was afraid of telling my husband for fear he might make
me continue if it didn’t work out.
KIPP
Yeah, don’t establish a network of support for yourself.
SUSAN
He might force me: “Just in case it doesn’t feel good you can jump right out.”
180
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Susan brought up something important about living in fear all the time. The truth you’re going
to fi nd out today is that you live in fear all the time. It’s so pervasive that for you it’s become
ordinary. So it’s only when you’re overwhelmed by fear that you notice that you’re frightened.
But the fear is there all the time: “afraid I might get stuck with this”; “afraid I might get boxed
in.” It’s there all the time. This is an experiment to see what it looks like to live in fear and don’t
call it that. Call it “everyday living.” The more forceful you are, the more frightened you are.
You’re just overcompensating for the fear, so to speak. Why do you suppose it takes courage?
The more frightened you are the more courage you need. The more forceful you are the more
frightened you are.
SUSAN
I’m not really sure. I keep being confused. My natural tendency is to want to fi x it.
ERHARD
No, it’s not your natural tendency; it’s its natural tendency.
SUSAN
Its natural tendency. I keep looking for something.
ERHARD
Right, to try to fi x it. And whatever you try to fi x gets permanent-ized.
SUSAN
I can’t wait to be able to share equally with my husband.
ERHARD
Well done. Just one point about not sharing in-order-to. Sharing attracts. Looking good ensnares,
and sharing attracts. You don’t build relationships talking about what you think. You build
relationships by speaking yourself, and listening self; listening for the self there, not listening
for the story there. If you listen for self, people will speak their selves. If you listen for crap, people
will tell you their crap. If you listen for self, people will tell you their crap fi rst, but they’ll get
around to speaking themselves.
A young man named Andy, wearing a sweatshirt with the logo “Youth at Risk” (a project of Werner
Erhard and Associates), rose.
ANDY
I am a lowdown mother-fucking sleeze.
ERHARD
What do you have to do with Youth at Risk?
ANDY
I work there.
“
is that you live in fear all the time. It’s
so pervasive that for you it’s become
ordinary.
Forum Day Three: Session One
181
ERHARD (to the group)
You’ve got to have advanced training to know that about yourself.
ANDY
My life’s been about being a sleaze. The question was “what do you care most about in life?”
and I said “I care about making a diff erence with people.” And I see that isn’t it. I care about
making a diff erence with young people and I could give a fuck about adults. And my actions
show that. So who I am with an adult is a snake in the grass.
ERHARD
That’s pretty popular. I’m for this and the hell with everything else. That doesn’t give you any
power with what you’re for.
ANDY (replaying a conversation he had)
So she said, “what do you get out of that?” I said, “well, I get to look good. Mr. morality. Mr.
right. Look like I’m honest—all the good stuff  that goes along with it. It was all fun and games
at fi rst.” “What’s the cost?” “I don’t see no cost. Maybe self-expression. Tell people what I’m
really thinking because I’m being manipulative.” “Well what about love?” “I could give a fuck
about love: I’ve got my family. I got all the love I need.” And then she said, “how could you do
what you do? You fucking hurt people, you use people, you lie. How would you feel if someone
was doing that to you all the time? And that’s all you’re doing.” And it does hurt. It hurts deep
inside. I was denying it.
KIPP (moving closer to Andy)
You were doing what you’ve done your entire life.
ANDY
I’m not denying it anymore. I am a sleaze.
KIPP
