“
[B]ecause the meaning of a word is determined by its web of 
relations to other words as embedded in a set of linguistic 
practices, and because humans are, as the Greeks saw, the 
“language animal” (zoon logon echon),
n there is no way to
suppose that humans first existed and then later invented 
first one word, then another, and so on. To see how language 
emerged, then, we need to make use of something like Witt-
genstein’s metaphor, “Light dawns gradually over the whole.” 
This image of a dawning light seems to be what is implied by 
Heidegger’s descriptions of the originary struggle that is prior 
to the appearance of humans and their explicit acts of naming.

Heidegger might put it this way: just as the modern era is the technological age, 
in which human being is enframed in the service of technological devices, the age 
of the Pre-Socratics was the age of the dawning light, when for a brief historical 
moment a full experience of Being was made available to human Being-in-the-
world.
The struggle for the Greeks, then, was to seize this moment, individuating
beings into their meaningful places in the world while at the same time retaining
their essential relation to the sway, and thus their fundamental orientation to Being.
For Heidegger, the greatness of the Pre-Socratics consisted in their recognition of 
this challenge, and its articulation in their thinking. At the same time, the promise of 
this achievement for Western thinking has been lost. As we proceed in this series of 
intervals on the forgetting of Being, we will consider further the nature of this loss.
