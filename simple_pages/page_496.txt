SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
They dwell in “is” too. Nobody coaches occurring. They coach is. They tell you how to hold the 
racket.
JERRY
How about the guy who wrote the book Inner Tennis. He coaches occurring, right?
ERHARD (walking toward Jerry and then standing right in front of him) 
He doesn’t talk about it that way, but he does “occurring.” What makes Tim Gallwey’s coaching 
eff ective—Tim coaches a shift in the occurring; he’s not trying to change the behavior. No 
matter how much I know how to behave, I’m going to behave as a correlate of the occurring. 
I’m not going to behave like I know how to behave. That’s true about you because you didn’t 
always behave the way your mother told you to behave. By the time I was fi ve years old, my 
mother told me everything I needed to know about how to be a decent human being. I had all 
the knowledge I needed. Didn’t make a damn bit of diff erence. I was a rat. You too. You tell 
yourself what to do, but you don’t do it, do you? 
JERRY
Sometimes.
ERHARD
Yeah. Sometimes. But you always, your actions are always correlated with the occurring of 
the world. That dictionary fl ies through the air, your hands will move in a dance with that 
dictionary, because your hands are correlated with the occurring of the world. 
JERRY
Yeah, I believe that, but it sounds like I missed something. 
ERHARD
Don’t believe. I want you to get it. 
JERRY
Well it feels like I’m missing something, because you’re saying it like it’s a big deal. 
ERHARD
Yeah, it is a big deal. I’ll tell you what the big deal about it is: Stop trying to change 
yourself. Stop trying to put properties inside of yourself. Stop trying to get yourself to do 
the right thing. Alter the way the world occurs for you, and your actions will naturally 
alter. You get that?
JERRY
Yeah, I believe I get it.
