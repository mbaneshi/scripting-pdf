Forum Day Three: Session Three 217
ERHARD
You think I’m saying “so what” like a put-down, but I’m not. I’m just saying “so what.”
Now you’ll do that when you do and you won’t when you don’t. Just like you did before you
discovered that. And then you’ll go on to some other asshole thing. Really. You were in a very
good place when you stood up at fi rst. Stay there for a while. Really. Don’t you understand?
Thirty-four years of trying to make it, I found out I never was going to make it. I got really
clear I was never going to make it. Never going to be anything enough. I found out I was a liar
once. There was a time when my whole life was a lie. But there was a moment when I found
out that everything that came out of my mouth was phony. I decided to stop lying. I almost
didn’t talk for a year, because I couldn’t get anything to come out of my mouth that wasn’t a
lie. “Where’s the toothbrush?” was about as close as I could get. Whatever I said, it was in-
order-to, I was up to something, it was a con someplace at some level. What happened on that
day this work began for me was I realized I was never going to be honest enough to make it. I
was always going to be exactly as honest as I was. I was never going to be less honest or more
honest than that. And if in three days I was going to be more honest, I was more honest, and
if in three days I was going to be less honest, I was less honest. And however honest I was on
that day, that’s how honest I was.
TONY
What you’re talking about is living in the present.
ERHARD
No, not quite. I don’t like that hippie shit. That’s horseshit for me.
TONY
I just got something.
ERHARD
What?
TONY
That my whole life I needed a mission in order to feel great about my life.
ERHARD
See, you’ve never done anything. I realized I knew nothing, because everything I knew, I knew in
order to: I knew nothing as itself. Everything I knew was distorted, had a certain twist to it, a cast
of color. It was never its own color. Everything I knew in-order-to—in order to make the world a
better place, in order to get ahead, in order to look good, in order to get ahead—is all horseshit in your
mouth, because it all has to do with looking good. So there’s nothing ruthless about it Tony. None of
it is itself. The tree is a tree: just a tree. It’s a tree. It’s not “in order to enjoy it.” It’s not “in order to”
anything. It’s a tree, like, a fucking tree. So I was real sad for a long time—about fi ve minutes—
then I started to laugh because I saw the joke of it all: the total joke. Because the realization was,
A chief quality that marks Being and Time as Heidegger’s masterwork
is that while it was written at an early point in his long career, and
although in later years his thinking took some significant turns,
Being and Time has nonetheless retained its stature. We see this as
evidence for the presence of the Same in Heidegger’s thinking over
time—the single thought that lies at the heart of every thinker’s
thinking, and remains always unthought in that thinking (we will
take up “The Same” in the sidebar of that title following “The
Violence of Meaning,” which follows this one).
As a narrative, Being and Time tells the story of Dasein,
which arcs from inauthentic lostness in the “they” to authentic
resoluteness. If, as Hubert Dreyfus suggests, we take Dasein to
stand for human being, then as the being who understands, who
interprets its self, Dasein must have a self that undergoes this
adventure. But the self of Dasein, as Heidegger distinguishes it, is
not the familiar ontic/psychological self—not the accumulation
of experiences and preferences that is generally represented
when one says “I.” Rather: “Dasein’s selfhood has been defined
formally as a way of existing, and therefore not as an entity
present-at-hand” (BT 312). The self of Dasein is not a being, but a
way of Being. If there is no “I” to choose, how is choice, and the
freedom it posits, even possible?
In its current manifestation, the specific way the self of Dasein
occurs for itself is determined by the interests of the “they” (please
see the last sidebar of Day Two Session One). The rules, the tasks,
and the standards have been determined before Dasein was thrown
into the game, to assure the survival of the “they,” and that’s the
way the world is.
But the real issue in this situation is not that Dasein’s choices
are limited; the problem is that they are not yet Dasein’s choices.

SPEAKING BEING
“I can’t not in-order-to.” I didn’t invent in-order-to; “Making it” invented me. They had that party
and I got there late. And they said what it is to be a human being, the kind of being a human being
is, is attempting to make it, to look good. That’s what it is to be a human being. And everything
you’re going to do is going to be that. See, you started out this conversation in a great place and there
have been a few changes since then. And when we’re done with this conversation we’re going to be
in a great place and then go through even more changes. ‘Cause you’ll have a new kind of making it.
For some people in this room, “making it” is not making it. They make it by not making it. It’s a trap.
It’s a fucking trap. That’s what it is to be human. The other side of it is, all those balls and chains I
was carrying around for years, they all dropped. You know, I was sad for a while, but then I got the
joke. It’s all a joke. You’re not going to make it. You know what? It isn’t going to work out. It is not
going to work out. You will never meditate enough, or work hard enough, or have your fortune told
enough, or get enough information, or be smart enough, or be holy enough, or practice enough, or
say your prayers enough, or be sexy enough, old enough, young enough, or think enough, or tough
enough to make it. See, some people are trying to survive. That’s also a joke. You’re going to die and
they’re going to stick you in a hole in the ground and throw dirt in your face. It is not going to work
out. That’s how survival is going to work out. You’re going to keep climbing the ladder and keep
climbing the ladder and at the top of the ladder, there’s going to be a hole there, and they’re going to
stick you in there and throw dirt in your face. And that’s how survival is going to work out. It is not
going to work out. It is not going to work out. You are never going to make enough of a diff erence to
make a diff erence. You are always not going to have made a diff erence enough. It isn’t going to turn
out. This is the whole Forum, you might as well get it. The rest is just polish.
Erhard spoke very slowly and deliberately to the group at this point.
ERHARD (continuing)
It is not going to turn out. And you know why it’s not going to turn out? Because it already
turned out. This is how it turned out. Nobody notices that. You made it. This is it. It’s not
gonna turn out. It did turn out. This is the way it turned out. And you fucked it up. You’re still
struggling. What would it mean if you did make a diff erence? So what? You make a diff erence.
Okay fi ne, so what?
TONY
It’s “so what?” because...
ERHARD
No “because.” Don’t fuck it up with “because.” It’s “so what?” because this is what’s so. That’s
why it’s “so what?” It’s just like this. This is how it turned out. You don’t like that, do you? You
didn’t want it to turn out this way. It wasn’t supposed to turn out like this, it was supposed to
turn out some other way. Too bad. This is the way it turned out. It doesn’t care that you don’t
like it.
TONY
There’s still something up for me.
The inauthenticity arises not from the situation, but from Dasein’s
way of being with this situation.
Choosing: Appropriating
And here we encounter one of Heidegger’s most important reversals
of everyday thinking, a move that has been central in Werner Erhard’s
rhetorical technology since its inception.
In our tradition, if one finds oneself stuck in a process generated
by choices one did not make, the action indicated by the situation
is clearly the making of new choices. But consider Heidegger’s
alternative and somewhat tricky perspective:
This process can be reversed only if Dasein
specifically brings itself back to itself from its
lostness in the “they.” But this bringing-back
must have that kind of Being by the neglect of
which Dasein has lost itself in inauthenticity.
(BT 312–313)
“
What has Dasein neglected? It has neglected to choose; therefore, it
must make up for not choosing. But “‘making up’ for not choosing
signifies choosing to make this choice”—that is, choosing to make
the choice not to choose. “In choosing to make this choice, Dasein
makes possible, first and foremost, its authentic potentiality-for-
Being” (BT 313).
ERHARD (continuing)
The “they” has always kept Dasein from taking
hold of these possibilities of Being. The “they”
even hides the manner in which it has tacitly
relieved Dasein of the burden of explicitly
choosing these possibilities. It remains indef-
inite who has “really” done the choosing. So
Dasein makes no choices, gets carried along by
the nobody, and thus ensnares itself in inau-
thenticity. (BT 312)
