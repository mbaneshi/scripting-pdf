Forum Day Three: Session Three 239
JACOB
I want to change it. I know this sounds sappy...
KIPP
Not sappy. Just disempowering. You’re the kind of guy that’s going to make no diff erence
because you’re going to try to change Ethiopia. Where is the world imperfect?
JACOB
There’s two kinds of perfect. There’s what you strive for, which we are neglecting here, and
then there is what already is.
WES (standing on the platform)
Let’s deal with your life fi rst. You haven’t seen what you look like.
JACOB
Yeah.
WES
You’re talking to Kipp like someone who hasn’t seen what a human being looks like who
follows what you’re talking about. You’re proposing a way of being and you haven’t seen how
absurd it is. When you see how absurd it is you’ll give it up in a minute: The absurdity of the
story that uses people’s lives.
JACOB
Yeah, I was going to say that there’s what happened, and then there’s the story. It makes life
interesting.
WES
What makes life interesting? Certainly not your story. You know what you’re story looks like?
JACOB
Yeah, violins playing in the background.
WES
Yeah, good.
JACOB
But it’s still interesting to me.
WES
No it isn’t. It stinks. There’s no possibility. This is what you look like. I’m going to demonstrate
you.
Our experience with the work of Werner Erhard has led us to the
recognition that a transformational leap must pass through the
domain of meaninglessness, and that an experience of Being
requires a confrontation with non-Being. We will therefore endure
(or enjoy) any silliness we encounter, and recognize that we are
mining one of the richest veins of Heidegger’s thought—perhaps
his most essentially reflexive distinction, sometimes his most
perplexing, but inevitably a ride we want to be along for.
A core rubric for this distinction is the Same; and since a distinction
can only be hinted at, Heidegger approaches this one throughout his
writing from various directions. In the 1941 lecture series published as
Basic Concepts, it emerges in a section concerning Being’s uniqueness,
and its diff erence in that respect from beings:
Beings can always be compared with beings
and placed into equivalence with one another.
However, [B]eing is never merely what is equiv-
alent in the manifold beings stone, plant, ani-
mal, man, God. For to be what is equivalent it
would have to be multiple. Being, by contrast is
everywhere the same, namely, itself. In order to
be equivalent, something other and additional
is required. To be the same, only uniqueness is
needed. (BC 44)
“
Heidegger’s languaging in such writing trips up our thinking. It
forces us to stop and double back, to be certain that what we
understood was what was said. It pulls the rug from under us.
Heidegger’s next sentence gives a final yank to a rug already
well-pulled:
As the same and unique, [B]eing is, of course,
forever diff erent in and from itself. (BC 44)

Thinking and Being
In the 1954 collection of essays entitled Early Greek Thinking,
Heidegger develops the distinction “the Same” in his exploration
of two fragments by Parmenides. A central question for

SPEAKING BEING
Wes held a pen about a foot in front of his mouth, trying to bite it while continuing to hold it out of
reach, and chasing it around the stage while complaining about his failure to reach it.
JACOB
Yeah, I could have told you that, though...
WES (continuing to try to bite the carrot)
I’ll get there. Shit. I’ll get a Ph.D. Shit. I’ll get married. Shit...
At this moment a participant seated in the “no-video” section of the room called out angrily that
the cameraman focused on Jacob was also including those seated in the “no-video” section. Kipp
promised that it would be handled and it was.
JACOB (returning to the conversation)
I get that. I’m like a stupid donkey tied to a cart chasing a carrot, trying to get it. But I see that
I’m just a little bit hungry and that’s leading me toward perfection.
WES
No, that’s bullshit.
JACOB
Okay, why?
WES
Because it is.
JACOB
Okay, can I do a demonstration of you?
WES
No.
JACOB
Why not?
WES
Because I said so.
JACOB
Dick.
Heidegger—an important subordinate question to his overarching
question of Being—concerns the relation between Being and
thinking. What is the nature of that relation? How intimately do the
two phenomena belong together?
One of these Parmenidean fragments has traditionally been
translated, “For thinking and Being are the Same.” Here Heidegger
interrogates that translation:
Does this word give us an answer to the ques-
tion of how thinking belongs to Being, in that it
says both are “the Same”? The word gives no
answer. In the first place, because the deter-
mination “the Same” precludes any question
about “belonging together,” which can only
exist between things that are diff erent. In the
second place, because the word “the Same”
says nothing at all about the point of view
from which, and for what reason, diff erence
passes over into sameness. Thus to auto, the
Same, remains the enigmatic key word for both
fragments—if not for the whole of Parmenides’
thought. (EGT 88)
“
Heidegger leaves us in the dark here, because he wants us to
place that enigmatic term in question. He wants us to recognize
our tendency to gloss challenging ideas with easy and familiar
interpretations:
Of course if we are of the opinion that the word
to auto, the Same, means “identical,” and if
we accept “identity” completely as the most
transparent presupposition for the thinkability
of whatever is thinkable, then by this opinion
we become progressively more deaf to the key
word, assuming that we have ever heard its
call. It is suff icient, however, to keep the word
in our hearing in its thought-provoking charac-
ter. In doing so we remain listeners. . . . (EGT 88)
