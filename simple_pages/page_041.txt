Forum Day One: Session One 
27
BILL
I appreciated her concern about my welfare.
ERHARD
Did you really, or were you bullshitting her?
BILL
No.
ERHARD
So you never told her “no,” right?
BILL
Never directly “no.”
ERHARD (turning to the group)
I’m revealing the nature of pressure. That’s what Bill and I are having this conversation
about. Nobody does The Forum because they were pressured into it.
(Erhard placed his hands on Bill’s head and pushed down)
That’s what pressure is. But what had the people from the Center done? They called you. They 
spoke to you. What else did they do? They stayed engaged in the conversation with you because
you never said no.
BILL
They called me every day. 
ERHARD
Every day?
BILL
Well, maybe every other day.
ERHARD (to the group) 
You all have a story, and your story is as full of shit as Bill’s. And I’m using language that’s 
clear enough for everybody to understand.
(to Bill)
Bill, because you’ve been carrying this load for everyone, you can leave now whatever your 
reason.
