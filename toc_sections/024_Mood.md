SPEAKING BEING
Nevertheless, despite its challenges, we assert that Being is
also the most important thing that one could talk about, since
talk that evokes Being has the ability to transform talk about
everything else.
A fundamental difference in this arena is the distinction
between ontological and
l
ontic inquiry. Ontological inquiry is
concerned primarily with Being. Therefore all of Heidegger’s
writing, and all of the dialogue of The Forum, is ontological in
nature. Ontic inquiry is concerned with beings, and with facts
about them. Therefore all of our everyday conversations—
everything from political discourse to casual social chat—may be
seen as ontic.
This is not to dismiss ontic inquiry as unimportant, or to
equate a discussion of religion or physics with coffeeshop banter.
We are not claiming that ontological inquiry is better, but that
it is essentially different. And in the experience of the authors,
it is profoundly interesting because of its transformational
possibilities. In this book, we will illuminate the nature of
ontological inquiry.
A prefatory note: people who write about Heidegger’s
work differ as to whether the term Being should be capitalized.
This is, of course, a choice for translators and not one that
confronted Heidegger, since in German all nouns are capitalized.
It is a problematic choice because capitalization tends to reify
or even deify, suggesting to some scholars that Being is “an
eternal metaphysical foundation or eternal principle,” while
for Heidegger it was “the event in which an entity reveals or
t
shows itself” (Michael E. Zimmerman, Heidegger’s Confrontation
with Modernity: Technology, Politics, Art xxii). Others feel that
t
capitalization is important so that what it means to exist (Being)
is not confused with the entities that exist (beings) (Richard Polt
Heidegger: An Introduction 3).
In print, Erhard himself did not capitalize the term: a 1985
Forum brochure states that the purpose of The Forum is to
provide participants with “direct access to the domain of being
itself.” In his more recent work, such as documents outlining
I want to make now is that whatever it is that you’re feeling, or whatever it is that you’re
thinking, or whatever your mental state is, or whatever your perception is, the way you are
viewing things—that’s exactly the way it ought to be. I’m going to probably have to say that
to you ten times, because you won’t remember that.
(to the group)
Another way you already always are is stupid about yourself. If that sounded a little bit like an
insult, you got it right. You may not be able to see that about yourself, but you’ll be able to see it
about others. As I said: not you, but other people.
(laughter)
There are ways of being with yourself that are disempowering and disenabling. You lose power
and you lose ability. Whatever way you fi nd yourself now, and whatever ways you fi nd yourself
variously throughout The Forum or in the evenings, or on the breaks: that’s the way you’re sup-
posed to be—whatever way that is. One way to disempower or disenable yourself is to question
whether you are being the right way... You’ll get a lot more out of The Forum a lot faster if you
let yourself be the way you are.
(pausing)
There’s a lot of this you’re not going to get. Some of it won’t make any sense. You’re not going
to get the whole Forum. The questions we’re asking in here are too powerful to get it all. The
Forum leaders are still getting it. So am I. But there are parts when you need to get it. In those
parts, put up your hand if you don’t. There will be a lot of repetition in here, too. For the fourth
time: you should be the way you are! However you feel, that’s the way it ought to be. The way
I know that is, that’s the way it is... The only right way to do The Forum is to be the way you’re
being. If you say you shouldn’t be pessimistic, you’re getting in your way.
A participant complained that she was distracted by and resentful about the physical set-up for this
Forum—the cameras, the observers, etc.
ERHARD
What you want to get out of that is that life is upsetting because it isn’t the way you expected it
to be. The Forum will be that way also. What you want to get out of that is that you’re already
upset. You’re already always upset at any change, at anything that violates your expectations.
You think you’re not upset until something violates your expectations. I said this strange thing:
you are already always upset. You live upset. I know you don’t believe that and I’m not asking
you to. You’re an upset waiting to happen. You’ll see that more clearly as we proceed.
LYNETTE
I’m often upset.
ERHARD
You’re always upset, and sometimes you notice it.
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day One: Session One

LYNETTE
Do you have any more advice about how to get the most out of this?
ERHARD
I do and we’ll go over that this morning.
TRENT
I hear there are Forum leaders here.
ERHARD
Forum leaders are here as part of their job.
TRENT
Four consecutive days instead of two weekends?
ERHARD
We’ve done this using odd schedules in diff erent settings, for instance, in  prisons.
BLAKE (who expressed reservations about speaking)
Continuing what you were saying as far as upset is concerned, and always being with you. My
barrier is the fear of revealing who I am. I should accept that.
ERHARD
Whatever you think is in the way, especially those things you think are part of the circum-
stances—for instance, you don’t get along with your boss and it’s quite clear to you that’s
because you work for a jerk—bring that in here. Blake is clear that it’s something he carries
around with him; it doesn’t come out of the circumstances. That’s easy. It’s the stuff  you think
is a product of the circumstances. So if there are circumstances in here, for instance, because
there are people observing—that sounds like it is a product of the circumstances.
CHRISSY
You talked about being in The Forum whatever way you are being. What about outside
The Forum?
ERHARD
Let yourself be like you are in those parts of The Forum that are outside The Forum, for
homework assignments during the breaks, etc. If that’s your mood at the moment, don’t try to
change it. You want it there because if it isn’t there it’s not going to get dealt with—particularly
those things you think are part of the circumstances: bring that in here. Most of what you do
outside The Forum in the next four days is going to be inside The Forum. If you do something
to avoid that, then you’ve successfully avoided that once more. See, there’s a lot of this you’re
his development of an ontological/phenomenological model of
leadership (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/ cf_dev/ AbsByAuth.
cfm?per_id=433651), he continues to employ the lowercase.
In this book, we will employ capitalization in those instances
where it clarifies the word’s meaning in a specific sentence.
We raise the point here to emphasize the unique nature of the
issues that arise in any discussion, oral or written, of this subject.
Being/being, as an ontological phenomenon, defies grammatical
categorization. ■
NOTE:  As of 2019, Landmark Worldwide’s Forum leader
faculty included more than 60 people, representing a diver-
sity in gender and race, and hailing from countries including
the United States of America, India, Japan, Australia,
New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Canada, Israel, the
Netherlands and Switzerland.

SPEAKING BEING
not going to like. You’re sitting there now with a whole bunch of assessments and conclusions.
We’ve done this a lot. I can even tell you what your assessments and conclusions are.
A participant asked whether, based on all of this, he should keep his specifi c issues and concerns
foremost in his mind.
ERHARD
You don’t need to have something you’re kind of holding in place. We will hook what’s there
in you that’s appropriate to be hooked and pull it up to the surface. So you can kind of relax
about that. A lot of stuff  you won’t even think about will get handled in here.
Another participant asked about the history of the organization.
ERHARD
We’ve been doing this work since 1971 and it was at the end of 1984 that we fi nished a four-
year process of developing The Forum, and we’ve been off ering The Forum since 1985 all over
this country, and in lots of other countries around the world.
At this point, a man named Jake rose to complain about the purpose of the evening session, to
which participants had been encouraged to invite guests.
JAKE
Isn’t that more for Werner Erhard and Associates to hustle more members?
ERHARD
You know that you are a hustle waiting to happen, right?
JAKE
I said I feel like I’m being hustled.
ERHARD
I said you are a guy who is being hustled waiting to happen.
JAKE
I don’t mind being hustled.
ERHARD
I said you are a guy who is being hustled waiting to happen.
JAKE
I don’t see it that way.
Erhard came down from the stage and sat on the edge of the platform near him.
Dasein
At the outset, it is important to introduce a term that is central
in Martin Heidegger’s work, and will therefore begin to come up
here almost immediately.
Dasein is Heidegger’s word for the Being of human beings,
and is one of the few terms in English editions of his writing
that consistently remain untranslated from the German. In
fact, the 2014 Dictionary of Untranslatables, published by
Princeton University Press, calls the word “a paradigm of the
untranslatable,” and devotes six double-columned pages to a
struggle to explain it (Adam Gopnik, “Word Magic,” New Yorker,.
May 26, 2014, 37).
A problem with translating this term, of course, is that term
is central in Heidegger’s most important work, Being and Time,
in which he presents his ontological model of human beings.
The specific elements of this model will be discussed in further
detail as we proceed. For now, it is sufficient to note that Dasein
will be spoken of as if the term indicates an individual; but since
it indicates the Being of that individual, it refers at the same time
more broadly to the collective Being of human beings.
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day One: Session One
13
ERHARD
You’re oriented around being hustled. You would see hustle where other people wouldn’t be
smart enough to see it.
JAKE
I could go along with that.
ERHARD
You are a guy who is being hustled waiting to happen. Remember I said people are upset wait-
ing to happen? You’re hustle waiting to happen.
JAKE
I’m still not getting it.
ERHARD
Okay good, then we’ll keep doing it until you do get it.
JAKE
In front of all these people?
ERHARD
Sure. You see hustle where others don’t. You are already always being hustled. You are waiting
for it to happen. You wake up that way in the morning, you just don’t have the circumstances to
express it yet.
JAKE
I think I see that... I am. I’m on the watch-out. I watch my bucks.
ERHARD
I’ve already got your bucks, don’t I? Before this is over I’m going to get some more of your
bucks.
JAKE
That’s a challenge.
ERHARD
With you, I’d almost bet on it.
He remained seated on the edge of the platform as this interaction modulated from confrontational
to friendly.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (continuing)
That by the way was meant as a compliment. I’m going to off er you an opportunity to do this
for the rest of your life, because I’m clear that you’re going to get a lot of value out of this and
I’m going to off er you the opportunity to get more value. You will always have the power to
decline. I want you to know that’s there in the relationship between me and you. I have no
reluctance to hustling you, because you always have the power to decline. Is that clear?
JAKE
Yeah, I got it.
The fi rst morning of The Forum continued as a dialogue with the group as Erhard responded to
participants’ questions. One woman expressed a concern that the content would go “over her head.”
ERHARD
Most of what I say is not designed for your head. Understanding is not the problem in life. If
you took a four-day course in how to be a tennis player and you left the course as a great tennis
player without understanding a word of it, the diff erence would be your being a great tennis
player. We don’t promise you any understanding. You’re welcome to understand. I like this
stuff , so I enjoy understanding it. That’s a quirk in me. We do this so that there’s a freedom
to be. If you walk out understanding, that’s the booby prize. You walk out of here with the
freedom to be that you didn’t have when you walked in here, then you got something for your
money. Speaking in here is designed to create the freedom to be... You don’t understand what
that means. What interests me is the freedom to be. You’ll be interested in that too before this
is over. I’ve done The Forum before so I know it works out.
A woman stated that she was already always nervous.
ERHARD (to the group)
How many people in here are already always nervous?
(most raising their hands)
You understand that the things that are going on with you are going on with everybody? You’re
like a rainstorm. You’ve got to get that there’s nothing personal about a rainstorm—that is,
that it waters the little fl owers. You think that the rainstorm is worried about life on earth. You
think that it rains so that... it rains in-order-to. It’s true that life is sustained by the rain, but it’s
not true that it rains in-order-to.
SAL (standing up, receiving a microphone)
You’re just arguing semantics.
ERHARD
No, it’s not semantics. Or the other answer to that is, yes it’s semantics, but so is everything else
in the universe.
Two Theses
The first thesis of this book, which will be addressed directly in
the text, is that the work of Werner Erhard is aligned in important
ways with the thinking of Martin Heidegger. Our purpose is to
show this alignment through a comparative analysis of their work,
an analysis that not only illuminates the thinking of both men, but
sheds light as well on the nature of their shared central concern.
The second thesis, equal in importance to the first, cannot
be addressed directly in the text. We have indicated it with the
term Being, since unless we indicate it we cannot talk about it—as
Heidegger puts it, “one cannot get by in public without rubrics”
(OWL 29). But the term serves merely as a place-holder, since
what it indicates cannot be thought, or even thought about, in our
Forum Day One: Session One
15
SAL
I believe that when it rains it rains in order to sustain life.
ERHARD
Okay, let’s stay there. Anybody else in that ballpark with Sal? Stand up if you are. Stand up if it
rains in-order-to.
(a number of people rose)
If you’re not standing and you are an in-order-to, you’re interfering with your participation in
The Forum. These people who are standing are not silly. They’ve got their foot nailed to the
fl oor someplace. This will happen to all of you a lot of times during The Forum.
(to Sal, indicating the director’s chair on the platform)
Are the legs there to hold up the chair? We know that the legs do hold up the chair. For the legs,
is there any in-order-to? Are the legs in-ordering-to?
(pausing)
It’s too hard that way... let me try something diff erent. Is the wall standing in order to hold the
ceiling up?
SAL
Yes, in my opinion.
ERHARD
Does the lightning lightning in order to start forest fi res?
SAL
No.
ERHARD
Where is this organ of intentionality in the rainstorm?
SAL
The spirituality of the universe.
ERHARD  (to the group)
He just told me where his foot’s nailed to the fl oor. He’s got something he believes so he can’t
think about it.
(to Sal)
You think there’s an intentionality in the rainstorm. You said it’s your belief that matter was
invaded by spirit in some way. Does it rain in order to produce fl oods?
usual way of conceptualizing. Think “freedom” and a conceptual
barrage is evoked; think “Being” and the mind’s resources are few.
Our second thesis, since it eludes capture in concepts,
can only be hinted at. It exists always as a background,
in a domain of language that remains always unspoken.
Unspoken, it is the unexamined context that shapes the way we
understand everything else; unspoken, it is made present as
the transformational background in the dialogue of The Forum;
unspoken, it is hinted at persistently in Heidegger’s writing and in
his lectures. Our second thesis, then, is this unspoken domain of
language, formally referred to as the ontological realm.
In this book, to show what Werner Erhard and Martin
Heidegger are doing in their work, the authors are called upon
to say—to hint at—the unspoken shared dynamic at the center
of that work. Inevitably, an element of mystery attends this
topic; but nothing here is devious or arcane. While ontological
communication makes rigorous demands on our everyday
understanding, Erhard’s work is a practical pedagogical
methodology, demonstrating that education beyond the merely
epistemological is a real-world possibility.
The authors intend that our second thesis will be
communicated in the background as we proceed through this
book, leaving the reader with a hint of its nature as it emerges in
The Forum.
One aspect of this background communication is that
unfamiliar terms or concepts may not be fully defined at the
point of their first appearance. Rather, they will be distinguished
gradually as they appear and reappear in the text. A definition
specifies conceptual limits; a distinction opens a space for
thinking and acting, and the space is expanded each time the
distinction is encountered. The goal of the inquiry, then, is
never an answer, but the opening of a question from which
to experience the world. We invite the reader to embrace the
freedom that this background of questionability gives: at play in
the question, you don’t need the right answer.  ■
16
SPEAKING BEING
SAL
No.
ERHARD
So the intentionality organ is not operating when it produces fl oods?
SAL
No, that just happens.
ERHARD
But it doesn’t just happen that when it rains life is sustained? Remember, Sal, there’s no ques-
tion between you and me that water does sustain life. The  question is: does it rain in-order-to?
Or does it just happen, and by the way, it sustains life?
At this point Sal seemed to see Erhard’s point, and sat down.
ERHARD (to Sal)
Okay. Now, just something personal between you and me. I’ve done this a lot. There’s some-
thing I appreciated about you in this conversation. You were open in the conversation.
(to the group)
Nobody’s ever going to win with me in here. Because this is my game, and only an asshole
would try to win in another guy’s game. You and I had a discussion where we got something
t
together. Rain is impersonal. We weren’t talking about a higher order of things. I don’t want
anybody to believe anything I say. And I’m not interested in sustaining anything you believe.
BLAKE (recalling what had happened up to this moment in the conversation)
I know that there was some sequence and I missed it. I mentioned that I was nervous, that I
didn’t like it, and then we were talking about the rain.
ERHARD (to the group)
He just demonstrated not knowing, being clear he didn’t know. That’s diff erent from being con-
fused. This is one of those things to get. There’s a diff erence between knowing that you don’t
understand, knowing that you didn’t follow something; knowing something didn’t make sense
and being confused are very diff erent. You didn’t invent being nervous. Even though the rain is
impersonal, you do personally get wet. The same thing goes for being nervous. Being nervous
is part of being human. Being human doesn’t belong to you; you belong to it. You didn’t invent
being human. You were late for the party. Being human is an already always way of being that
you walked into. It’s like a rainstorm, and it’s true you personally got wet. You are a human
Ontologic al Dialogue
A striking aspect of Erhard’s method, one which appears again
and again throughout The Forum, is his persistence in pressing
any interaction or any topic of discussion through to completion.
Complete, for Erhard, does not mean simply finished, but rather
whole, and lacking none of its essential parts. Repeatedly, after
he has been engaged on a particular point with an individual, he
requests that others in the room who are not clear on that point
stand, and works with each participant individually until all of
them have “gotten” it for themselves. Erhard often uses the term
“flatten” in the same sense, as in “Let’s get that one flat before
we move on.” To get something flat, in an ontological dialogue,
means that the item in question has been moved beyond a purely
conceptual level of understanding, and has been distinguished
as an ontological possibility, at least in a preliminary sense. The
distinction will continue to be teased out as The Forum proceeds,
ultimately becoming a clearing for Being; but the first step in that
process is to flatten the concept, so that its ontological possibility
can be heard.
Of course, “getting it” and “being complete” might be
read as “having surrendered to Erhard’s point of view.” Erhard
himself seemed to support this interpretation, telling one Forum
participant Blake, “Nobody’s ever going to win with me in here.
Because this is my game, and only an asshole would try to win in
another guy’s game.” During a debriefing session with The Forum
leaders regarding their role in the dialogue, Erhard again referred
to the process in agonistic terms: “You’ve got to have some
appreciation for the advantage you’ve got there,” he said. “And
yeah, you’re going to use the advantage, that’s part of the game.”

being, but you didn’t make up human being. You didn’t invent being nervous. You didn’t invent
having a barrier to expressing yourself. That doesn’t belong to you. That’s not yours. That’s in
the already always being of human being. It doesn’t belong to you; you belong to it.
(forcefully)
It owns you! You don’t own it. Being nervous owns your life. You don’t own being nervous. The
metaphor is that there’s nothing personal about a rainstorm. It just rains, and I, you, personally
get wet. But the rainstorm didn’t rain in order to get me wet. Being nervous is already always
there in the being of being human. And you and I walk out into that rainstorm and get wet...
In The Forum, you get back the power to say something about your own way of being. Now
you can only report on it. But you can’t say “I’m not nervous” and have it make any diff erence.
After The Forum you will be able to.
BLAKE
I’m not as nervous as when I first stood up. I am here to make a change, find a new occupa-
tion, to get up in front of people. What it requires is getting up.
ERHARD
Not necessarily.
BLAKE
Well, I don’t know.
ERHARD
That’s right. And I do know.
BLAKE
That’s why I’m asking you.
ERHARD
I want to get it settled because you’re going to keep saying those stupid kinds of things: what
you have to do and what you don’t have to do for this to work. And the answer is you don’t
know. So I’m gonna tell you: what you have to do is what you do. So you’ll always know what
you have to do because you’re doing what you’re doing. To do something you’re not doing:
that’s bad. If you do what you do it’ll all work out. One of the things that you are doing is think-
ing you have to stand up. That’s fi ne for you to think that. You wanna know why I think it’s
fi ne for him to think that? Because that’s what he’s thinking.
BLAKE
You’re right. At some point you broke through whatever was in the way and now you’re up
there doing what you are doing.
The game in The Forum is the evocation of the presence
of Being, and The Forum leader’s opponent is the way of being
that we in the technological age have been born into (the way
we wound up being). Clearly, there is a certain direction which
must be maintained in The Forum dialogue if its purpose is
to be achieved. The maintenance of this direction in the face
of participants’ resistance might appear, to the everyday
understanding, as motivated by a need on The Forum leader’s
part to win the game, so that The Forum’s perspective is shown
to be the true one. However, accepted in The Forum is that The
Forum leader’s responsibility is maintaining the ontological
character of the conversation. “My job,” said Erhard, “is to
manage the dialogue.” This management is not a matter of
winning, but of keeping the way in view. In a recent conversation
with the authors, Erhard put it this way: “I used this way of
speaking to deal with people who are resisting in order to resist,
rather than functioning in a dialogue.”
Any discussion of dialogue as pedagogy must always consider
the question of mutuality, and this is especially delicate when the
dialogue’s purpose is the presencing of Being. The Forum leaders’
rank in The Forum dialogue is given by their ability to listen to
the conversation from a certain perspective. As Erhard told The
Forum leaders, “You’ve got to know that an authentic dialogue is
going to generate clarity. You’ve also got to watch you don’t get
hooked. What hooks [you] is when someone says something that
you think puts you at a disadvantage.” Being hooked, for a Forum
leader, means being drawn into argument or commiseration with
participants’ stories about their lives, rather than maintaining
the transformed perspective given by The Forum’s ontological
distinctions. It is The Forum leader’s job not to get hooked.
This balance between mutuality and directedness in an
ontological dialogue is an important matter. Obviously, there is
a thrust to such a dialogue—a movement of the conversation in
the direction of its ontological intention. In his dialogue with the
Japanese scholar in On the Way to Language, Heidegger points
to the nature of true dialogue when he states that “we may
