Praise for Speaking Being
From the Aft erword:
I regard Speaking Being as an enormously important contribution to understanding
Heidegger and Erhard. The latter has received far too little serious academic
attention, and this book begins to make up for that lack. Moreover, the book‚Äôs
analysis of Heidegger‚Äôs thought is among the best that I have ever read. I commend
this book to all readers without reservation.
MICHAEL E. ZIMMERMAN, Professor Emeritus, University of Colorado, Boulder
This book is powerful, imaginative, frustrating, amusing, threatening, and
enlightening‚Äîall at the same time. It also has the power to transform your life.
JONATHAN D. MORENO, University of Pennsylvania Professor of Ethics,
author of Impromptu Man
The profound impact of Werner Erhard‚Äôs work on culture and society is a
manifestation of an incredible insight, the experience of being, presented in
this book through a comparative analysis of a transcript of a 1989 Forum led by
Erhard alongside Heidegger‚Äôs reflections on the meaning of ‚Äúbeing there.‚Äù The
authors have drawn amazing parallels between these two extraordinary thinkers
and have demonstrated the intersections of Heidegger‚Äôs language with Erhard‚Äôs
ontological rhetoric of transformation. Erhard has at times described aspects of his
method as ruthless compassion, and like all forms of compassion, evident here is a
fundamental motivating desire to alleviate the suff ering of others.

Medicine, and Senior Editor of  The Oxford Handbook of Compassion Science
Speaking Being is not a book. It is a multimodal tour de force of ontological rhetoric
that hails its reader into an event and in so doing performs as an event, rather
than what is commonly rendered as a book between two covers. Its status as an
event is performed on every page wherein the ‚Äúshowing‚Äù of Being is enacted via
its remarkable design. Kaleidoscopically, Bruce Hyde and Drew Kopp have drawn
their readers into a dazzling display, where the participants in dialogue with Werner
Erhard in a specific Forum in 1989 are put into dialogue with Martin Heidegger. The
result is arguably one of the most astounding academic interventions into both
Erhard‚Äôs methodology and Heideggerian thought. Citing David Farrell Krell, Hyde
and Kopp remind us that ‚Äúto be on a woodpath means to be in a cul-de-sac, a path
that leads nowhere and has no exit.‚Äù Speaking Being puts its readers in a dizzying
cul-de-sac within which they may never leave, but rather transform into one of the
glittering particles of this rhetorical kaleidoscope.
CYNTHIA HAYNES, Professor of English, Clemson University, author of  The Homesick
Phone Book: Addressing Rhetoric in the Age of Perpetual Conflict
Theory and Practice: Ways of seeing what one claims to be the truth of some
intended object of consciousness and ways of applying this truth to one‚Äôs
everyday existence in order to cultivate wisdom, goodness, self-realization, and
justice. The dialogical teachings of Werner Erhard speak to the importance of this
relationship and its ontological significance. Professors Hyde and Kopp, scholars
of rhetoric and communication who had observed and participated in programs
designed by Erhard, provide comprehensive and detailed conversations‚Äîwhat
they term ‚Äúontological rhetoric‚Äù‚Äîthat took place in Erhard‚Äôs 1989 Forum, and they
demonstrate how Erhard and Heidegger can be read together for the benefit of
both. This book is a major achievement in the scholarship of Erhard and Heidegger
studies. A much-needed moment of enlightenment.
MICHAEL J. HYDE, University Distinguished Professor of Communication Ethics, Wake
Forest University, author of Perfection: Coming to Terms with Being Human
In Speaking Being the reader discovers two original thinkers‚ÄîWerner Erhard
and Martin Heidegger‚Äîtwo intellects who independently reached linguistic,
ontological, and phenomenological philosophies that illuminate each other.
