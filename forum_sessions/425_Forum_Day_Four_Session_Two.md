Forum Day Four: Session Two

WES
No, there is languaging.
TIM
Languaging creates the rainstorm.
WES
Languaging creates everything.
TIM
Yeah. Including problems.
WES
Including problems. And you are given an already way of relating to problems. We’re giving you
a new way to relate to problems: to let them be.
TIM
Okay.
WES
For the moment. In order to deal with something powerfully, you have to be able to let it be.
I can change the fl oor if I could let it be. If I’m arguing about the fl oor all day I’ll never get
around to changing it. From complaining about the fl oor all day I’ll never get to deal with it.
TIM
Thank you.
WES
We’ve got “problems are in languaging,” and we’ve got a way where we can let them be. It’s
okay to have a problem. They occur in languaging. We want to look at a specifi c problem to
see what access we have to the problem when we let it be. Now I’m going to share my one real
problem—the problem of all The Forum leaders who live in California. My problem is “I want
to go to the beach but I don’t have time. I’m always in The Forum.” Whatever your problem is, it
fi ts in that form. Something... but something.
On the chalkboard Wes wrote “I want to go to the beach but I don’t have time” on the chalkboard.

You need to take one of your problems and put it in that form. Get the confl icting things.
The way you get something stuck is you get one force opposed by an equal and opposite
force. They have to be equal and opposite or you won’t get stuck. If one force is bigger than the
other, there will be movement. Anybody who can’t see that? That’s the nature of a problem.
in the foreground of a conversation; but the distinction maintains its
force only while those concepts are being generated. In this relevant
passage, Heidegger distinguishes two ways in which beings (includ-
ing ideas and concepts) can be brought to appear in the world:
Considered in terms of the essence of space,
the diff erence between the two types of
appearing is this: appearing in the first and
authentic sense, as the gathered bringing-it-
self-to-stand, takes space in; it first conquers
space; as standing-there, it creates space for
itself; it brings about everything that belongs
to it, while it itself is not imitated.
“
Appearing in the second sense merely steps
forth from an already prepared space, and it is
viewed by a looking-at within the already fixed
dimensions of this space. The aspect off ered by
the thing, and no longer the thing itself, now
becomes what is decisive. Appearing in the first
sense rips space open. Appearing in the second
sense simply gives space an outline and measures
the space that has been opened up. (IM 203–204,
emphasis and paragraphing added)
“
In the initial saying of a primordial metaphor, then, the space of a
distinction is ripped open. Subsequently, with each new and onto-
logically consonant languaging of that distinction—or with each re
iteration of the dialogic unfolding of the series of hints—the space
that has been created expands.
But this demands that the space be opened newly in each occur-
y
rence. Erhard is emphatic on this point: “I never repeat material,” he
told an audience in 1989, “and I mean that quite literally. Every time
I deal with something, I deal with it anew, like something to make
present between you and me” (“Beyond the Winning Formula”).
Two categories of distinctions are suggested by the two guid-
ing questions of The Forum. The first category includes our current
but concealed ways of being human—our “blind spots.” These are

SPEAKING BEING
Problems in life are presented as two equal but opposite forces in which you get stuck. Get a
problem up for yourself and see that they are constructed by equal but opposite forces. The
only problem with this is that there are some lies up here. What’s a lie up here?
GRACE
It’s the word “but” and it implies that there is no solution or no way out, or that you’re stuck.
WES
Okay. Here is what “but” means, and why it’s a problem: Problems are created by buts...
(laughter)r
Welcome to the fourth day of The Forum. Problems are created by buts, because “but” means
what follows it—this is the logic of linguistics here, okay—what follows “but” negates what pre-
cedes it, like an equal and opposite force to it. “I want to go to the beach” is stopped by the equal
and opposite force “I don’t have enough time,” because of “but.” You see that?
GRACE
Say “and”?
WES
Why would we want to say “and”?
GRACE
If you say “and” you have two things to look at and you can do something if you want to.
WES
That’s close. Here’s the question. “But” says this is an equal and opposite force to that. Is it really?
GRACE
No. They are two separate issues!
WES
What’s the equal and opposite force to “I don’t have time”?
GRACE
“I have time.”
WES
“I do have time,” right? “I do have time” is the equal and opposite force to “I don’t have time,”
so that’s what’s really equal and opposite. And “I don’t want to go to the beach” is the equal and
opposite force to “I want to go to the beach.”
the things about ourselves and our behavior that “we don’t know
that we don’t know,” which emerge within the question: “What is
the Being of human beings?” In the second category are the new
possibilities of Being, which can be distinguished only when the
blind spots have been discovered and chosen, and the background
of meaninglessness revealed as it is within the question: “What is
the possibility of Being for human beings?”
This categorization is certainly valid at the levels of aff ect and
value—the “bad” behaviors we want to change versus the im-
proved versions we want to create—but considered ontologically,
the diff erence is only apparent. The distinctions in both categories
assign meaning to the meaningless. But, it may be argued, were
not the behaviors being distinguished in the first category—such
as my racket—already there, albeit unrecognized?
Heidegger responds that they have always been available as
possibilities. “What is spoken out is already necessarily within phy-
sis (Being), otherwise it could not be spoken from out of it” (FCM
26). This is why its emergence into the world clicks for us even as
it blows us away, occurring as something that at some level we
already knew; and thus its showing up is accompanied by “the ring
of truth,” as shown in this brilliant passage from Being and Time:
Before Newton’s laws were discovered, they
were not ‘true’; it does not follow that they
were false, or even that they would
become false if ontically no discoveredness
were any longer possible. [. . .] To say that
before Newton his laws were neither true nor
false, cannot signify that before him there
were no such entities as have been uncov-
ered and pointed out by those laws. Through
Newton the laws became true and with them,
entities became accessible in themselves to
Dasein. Once entities have been uncovered,
they show themselves precisely as entities
which beforehand already were. Such uncover-
ing is the kind of Being which belongs to ‘truth.’
