No, I don’t.
ERHARD
Okay, thank you. You can sit down now if you want.
(applause as Jane sits)
ERHARD
You became that there’s something wrong. The question is: What did you do about it? The
answer is that from there on out, everything you did, everything you are, most particularly what
you’re really good at, was a response to, a way of dealing with, that there’s something wrong!
Your best moments, what you’re best at, what you’re most confi dent at, the best things in your
life... You got married—listen up!—you got married because there’s something wrong. It was
a way to deal with that there’s something wrong. No shit. I didn’t say your marriage wasn’t
wonderful. Your marriage may be the greatest thing that ever happened, but you got married
because there’s something wrong.  You had kids because there’s something wrong. You chose
your profession because there’s something wrong. You live your life because there’s something
wrong. And you developed the answers—that you got to what to do about the fact that there’s
something wrong—to a very high level. You’re really good at a lot of things, aren’t you? Really!
There are things you are really good at. The things you’re really good at—listen up. I know you
don’t get it yet—the things you’re really good at started out, had their genesis, are at the source a
way of dealing with that there’s something wrong. Here’s the evidence for my assertion: nothing
satisfi es you. Nothing satisfi es you. The things that you’re good at don’t satisfy, don’t nurture
you, don’t fulfi ll you, don’t leave you full of joy. They gratify you, because they make up for the
fact that something’s wrong. But they don’t fulfi ll you, don’t leave you full of joy, don’t leave you
fulfi lled. They don’t leave you complete. Did you ever notice, you’re never complete? Never. No
matter what you accomplish. No matter what you build, no matter what you create, no matter
what pleasure or accomplishment or satisfaction there is in your life, it’s never enough.
(Erhard moves around the room, speaking very loudly and forcefully)
And it’s never enough because you’re never going to be anything enough. You see, this is the
other side of the coin. We were talking about the bad stuff  before. I’m talking about the good
stuff . I’m talking about the good stuff  in your life: you know, your marriage, your romance,
your love aff air, the job that you’re very good at, that you’ve really developed your real skills in.
The stuff  in life that people can really count on you for. Your contributions to other people, the
diff erence you’ve made in life: that’s also only in the service of making up for the fact that you
are that there’s something wrong. The evidence for that assertion is that even the things that
you’re the best at, even the things that are the fi nest part of you, like your contributions to other
people, like the diff erence you’ve made for other people, like the sacrifi ces you’ve made for the
benefi t of other people—you know, you raised children all your life and you’ve done a great job
at it, and it’s still fucking not enough. You know you gave, gave, gave, and after a while you stop
giving, because it’s not enough to make up for “there’s something wrong here.” Yeah. Nothing.
Nothing. Nothing’s good enough for you, because nothing is for being good enough. Nothing is
Clearly, in a thinking that requires our familiar way of
thinking to be put under the possibility of deconstruction or
erasure, one is inherently at risk. This point was made repeatedly
by Heidegger, and is central to the rhetorical strategy of Werner
Erhard. The identity, the subject, the cogito, which is presently
dominating the clearing and thus confounding the appearing of
Being, does not want to be displaced. In clearing our “there,” in
unconcealing the clearing, we render our subjectivity homeless:
this is essential, since in our being “put out of the home in this
way, the home first discloses itself as such.” Thus the event of
unconcealment is also “the happening through which human
beings become homeless” (IM 186). Always on the way, we have
no home. No wonder we resist.
In Being and Time, in a passage which Erhard has quoted,
Heidegger states that any attempt to analyze Being “constantly
has the character of doing violence, whether to the claims of the
everyday interpretation, or to its complacency and its tranquilized
obviousness” (BT 359; quoted in “Heart of the Matter”). Heidegger
has further expressed this violent characteristic by describing the
opening for Being, not as a sylvan and tranquil clearing, but as the
turbulent battleground of a breach: “Historical humanity’s Being-
here means: Being-posited as the breach into which the excessive
violence of Being breaks in its appearing, so that this breach itself
shatters against Being” (IM 181). The sense of “historical” here
is not that of mere facts and trivia; rather, it has to do with the
making of history that occurs in moments when the way in which a
human being understands itself transforms, leaps from identifying
with what Erhard has termed the “story” to Being-in-the-world as
a new possibility for Being. Any transformation threatens what is
already there—held in place as it is by the “they” self who seeks to
reduce, or level down, Being to accommodate the averageness of
the everyday.
Thus, this fundamentally threatening nature of
unconcealment produces in Dasein what Heidegger calls the “will
to conquer that at the same time shrinks back” (IM 196). The task
at hand is forbidding: to be on the way, Dasein must engage in a
violent struggle to wrest Being from unconcealment, and in the
struggle must risk itself essentially. “Here,” writes Heidegger,

for being complete. Everything is for making up for that there’s something wrong here. What
gives you your life—more accurately, sorry, more accurately—what gives you your self, what
gives you your identity, the person you’ve built yourself into being, was built in response to
(speaking each syllable with equally intense emphasis)
that there is some-thing pro-found-ly wrong. Now if you need evidence, what you’ve got to use
for evidence is “what is it that’s left you full of joy?” What is it? Look, there are eight hundred
people in here in this room. There’s got to be some pretty remarkable accomplishments in this
room. People of remarkable accomplishment; there’s got to be people in here who have made
ridiculous contributions. There’s got to be people in here who have saved people’s lives, there’s
got to be people in here who have nurtured people’s lives, there’s got to be people in here who
have impacted whole communities, there may be people here who have made important,
signifi cant contributions to countries, and there’s not one person in here satisfi ed. Not one
person in here truly, completely, wholly fulfi lled. Not one person in here full of joy. That’s my
evidence.

PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 8)
I’ve done some looking at this and I have a question and we can use me as a case in point.
When I was in the third or fourth grade, a few things happened close together, where I got
really embarrassed, and I decided that no one was going to embarrass me that way again. No
one is ever going to laugh at me again. Out of that I became a master student, head of the class,
straight A’s all the way through college. Awards, degrees, all sorts of honors and no satisfaction.
My fi rst wife made a fool of me and so in my second marriage I married someone that would
never leave me. It’s all a solution to “no one is ever going to make a fool of me again.”
ERHARD
Right.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 8)
So all the things you’re saying I can really see in my life, where what could really be
accomplishments are I’m making a point and I’m making sure there’s no satisfaction.
ERHARD
Right because there’s no satisfaction in compensating for being “there’s something profoundly
wrong here.” All you do is what? Reinforce down there at the bottom that there’s something
wrong here.
(asking a participant to stand up; Erhard pushes against his shoulders)
It’s kind of like this: whatever you’re pushing up against, you’re attached to. I’m attached to
him, just as surely if he held me close to him. In fact I’m more attached to him than if he held
me close to him because he doesn’t have to do any of the work; I do all the work.

the uncanniest possibility of Dasein shows
itself: to break the excessive violence of
Being through Dasein’s ultimate act of vio-
lence against itself. Dasein does not have this
possibility as an empty way out, but it is this
s
possibility insofar as it is; for as Dasein, it must
indeed shatter against Being in every act of
violence. (IM 197)
M
As we show in our series of sidebars on Technology (during the
third and final session of Day Four), The Forum provides an
opportunity for Dasein’s calculative machinations to be seen for
what they are, and the game is up. Yet only through this struggle
can Dasein become itself, and serve its constitutive role as the
site for the disclosure of Being: the struggle is “an act of violence
against the overwhelming, but at the same time always and only
for it” (IM 196).
Heidegger has at times described this ongoing struggle in
oppressive terminology:
“
the renewed resurgence of the act of violence
against Being, in such a way that the almighty
sway of Being violates Dasein (in the literal
sense), makes Dasein into the site of its appear-
ing, envelops and pervades Dasein in its sway,
and thereby holds it within Being. (IM 198)
M
In his later work, it must be noted, Heidegger’s languaging of
unconcealment is less violent: it is articulated more gently as a
turning-toward Being, a releasement of and into Being. However,
we emphasize the element of resistance here (as has Heidegger)
because such resistance characterizes much of the dialogue
in The Forum (as well as many discussions of Erhard himself).
Erhard does not attempt to minimize this resistance; in fact, he
acts strategically to unconceal it. For instance, early on Day One of
The Forum, aft er confronting the participant Bill concerning being
pressured to be in The Forum, Erhard asked, “Why was I bad with

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (continuing)
(participant sits down)
So if your accomplishments are there as an answer to that there’s something wrong, to make
up for that there’s something wrong, to deal with that there’s something wrong, then the more
you accomplish the more powerfully the context—listen!—the more powerfully the context that
there’s something wrong is established. See look...
(moving to the chalk board.)
Remember the two circles, “tall” in two contexts? Suppose the context is “there is something
wrong.” The more content you build, the more achievement, the more accomplishment, the
more content builds, the more fulfi lled the context becomes. Anybody who can’t see that?
SUZANNE
I don’t understand.
ERHARD
Okay, thank you.
SUZANNE
I don’t understand the statement that the more achievement one has, that there’s something
wrong.
ERHARD
Good. Did you see that she asked the question very precisely? Real big opening to get the
answer. What I said was that “that there’s something wrong” becomes—you become that
there’s something wrong; you are that there is something wrong. In other words, “that there is
something wrong” is the clearing in which life happens now. It’s the opening for life to occur.
It’s the space in which everything arises. You clear about that statement so far? That’s not the
answer yet, but are you clear about that so far?
SUZANNE
Is it, “that there’s something wrong,” is it the cause and the achievement is the eff ect? Or...
ERHARD
Not quite, no. Sorry. The answer is no, and it’s like that, but it’s not that. It’s “that there’s
something wrong” is the context, and the achievement is the content in that context.
SUZANNE
So, the achievement is not an eff ect of “there’s something wrong.” It’s a context.
ERHARD
It is a content of the context “there is something wrong.” See hold on for a second. This business
about cause and eff ect you and I understand, and are very comfortable with. You don’t have
to think that, you have those thoughts. You think in a cause/eff ect world. But the world of
you just now? Because I want to get this story up. There’s a lot of
people with that story here and I want to get that story killed.”
This unconcealing clears the way for the appropriation of the
resistance: participants in the dialogue, by recognizing, allowing,
and owning their resistance, become who they are, in preparation
for the disclosure of their possibility.
Lest the view of Dasein as scene-of-violent-unconcealment be
taken as unduly negative, Heidegger adds an important point:
“
This [talk of violence] looks like pessimism. But
it would be preposterous to label Greek Dasein
with this term—not because the Greeks were
somehow optimists at bottom aft er all, but
because these assessments miss Greek Dasein
altogether. The Greeks were, to be sure, more
pessimistic than a pessimist can ever be. They
were also more optimistic than any optimist.
Their historical Dasein had not yet entered the
realm of pessimism and optimism. (IM 197–198)
M
This way of thinking, in which relatedness with Being allows
the transcendence of subjective value dualities, appears to come
into play within Heidegger’s and Erhard’s ethics. While the results
of The Forum, to whatever degree they manifest themselves in
participants’ lives, are certainly played out in the moral arena,
morals (and their contemporary variation, “values”) are an ontic
issue, and the essential content of The Forum is ontological.
Here we think Joseph J. Kockelmans, synthesizing Heidegger,
expresses Erhard’s view as well: “Every valuing, even if it values
in a positive manner, is and remains a subjectivizing; it does not
let beings be. To call God the highest value is to degrade the true
essence of God” (On the Truth of Being 258). Being is not moral.
Being “is” not anything except Being.
The rhetorical conversation of The Forum, rather than taking
morality as its content, approaches morality indirectly, by way
of Being. Here, we wish to underline Heidegger’s point: that the
violence of the act of unconcealing Being is the “flip side” of the
Forum Day Three: Session Four

being is not like that quite. There’s causality too, but there’s a more subtle relationship, one of
context and content. Contexts don’t cause contents. The relationship is not one of causality. It’s
a diff erent relationship. But it’s like cause and eff ect, but not the same.
SUZANNE
I’m equating achievement as power.
ERHARD
I don’t have any problem with that. However, achievement, even as power, in the context
“there’s something wrong,” each achievement reinforces the context: the more achievement,
the stronger, more forceful the context. As you build content, you validate the context. So for
example, if I say two, and three, they’re content in the context called numbers. You follow that?
SUZANNE
Yes I follow that.
ERHARD
Very good. If I go on to seventy-four, ninety-nine, one third, and three point one four, I’ve
expanded the amount of content, and by doing so I’ve validated the context called numbers. The
context called numbers has gotten stronger and stronger. Even if the content is empowering,
nevertheless the context is more and more validated. Clear?
SUZANNE
There is an aspect in that logic on what’s wrong: that area I’d like to explore.
ERHARD
Please.
SUZANNE
I don’t see... I still don’t understand that statement. I’d like to go deeper. But then, not that
I’m confused. I got an equation of the earlier, I never, I don’t want to share. But this particular
premise strikes me because of achievement, the word achievement I equate with power.
ERHARD
First off , you’ve got your foot nailed to the fl oor about achievement a little bit—like some of you
had your foot nailed to the fl oor about God and some of you had your foot nailed to the fl oor
about sincerity—it’s kind of like you have idolized accomplishment a bit. Accomplishment is
kind of like the Holy Grail for you. A little bit, and so it makes the conversation a little bit hard
for you to hear. A little bit it sounds like I’m denigrating accomplishment. I’m actually not
denigrating accomplishment, but never mind, it sounds like I am. Does it not?
SUZANNE
It did at the beginning.
attainment of the clearing of aletheia (please see the sidebar “The
Three Levels of Truth” in Session Two of Day Four). Both positive
and negative, emergence and concealment, violence and aletheia,
are constitutive of Being. This idea is worked out most fully in
Heidegger’s conception of the “Nothing.” ■
