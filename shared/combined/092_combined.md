Jargon
Erhard’s influence on the language of Western culture has been significant. His
terminology, like Heidegger’s, has always been unusual and highly purposive, and
many of these words and phrases made their way into the public sphere, some to
lasting effect. But that language, in its casual use, began to lose its power. Heidegger
detailed this process of devolution in Being and Time:
SESSION FOUR INTERVAL
I hardly use the word “transformation” at all any more. . . . because
while it once was a word that people had to think about, struggle
to grasp, work on, that’s just not true anymore. The word no longer
wakes people up. Now, when you say “transformation,” the word
puts them to sleep—like they know what it means—they stop
thinking, looking, inquiring.
Instead, he said, as his ontological inquiry has developed, “the notions keep getting
said differently” (Simon, “Quarterbacks and Coaches: Tossing It Around with Werner
Erhard,” Family Therapy Networker, March–April 1986, 30–39).
Heidegger addressed his own confrontation with this situation in his essay “A
Dialogue on Language,” a transcript of his conversation with a Japanese scholar. At
one point Heidegger (referred to in the transcript as the Inquirer) mentions two of
the ideas that were central in his early work, hermeneutics and phenomenology.

SPEAKING BEING
In the language which is spoken when one expresses oneself, there
lies an average intelligibility; and in accordance with this intelligi-
bility the discourse which is communicated can be understood to a
considerable extent, even if the hearer does not bring himself into
such a kind of Being towards what the discourse is about as to have
a primordial understanding of it. We do not so much understand
the entities which are talked about; we already are listening only to
what-is-said-in-the-talk as such. What is said in the talk gets under-
stood; but what the talk is about is understood only approximately
and superficially. . . . Idle talk is the possibility of understanding
everything without previously making the thing one’s own. . . . Thus,
by its very nature, idle talk is a closing-off , since to go back to the
ground of what is talked about is something which it leaves undone.
(BT 212–213)
“
Erhard’s comments in a 1986 interview, discussing the evolution of his own
language use, echo Heidegger’s account of the process by which terms lose their
originative power. Many of the words he had used in his work, Erhard said, “even-
tually drifted into popular use.” They “lost the creative intention behind them and
degenerated into a kind of jargon.” Outside their original context, as Heidegger put
it, the terms no longer reached out into the “totality of involvements” in which their
significance was grounded (BT 200).
This was the fate of the term “transformation,” a central term to which Erhard
had assigned “an extremely precise meaning.” Today, he said, “you hear it every-
where. You read about it in business journals. It’s ‘hot.’ So, to some degree, it’s lost
its potency.” He continued:
[Japanese]: I am all the more puzzled that you have meanwhile
dropped both words.
[Inquirer]: That was done, not—as is so oft en thought—in order to
deny the significance of phenomenology, but in order to abandon
my own path of thinking to namelessness.
[Japanese]: An eff ort with which you will hardly be successful. . . .
[Inquirer]: . . . since one cannot get by in public without rubrics.
(“DL” in OWL 29)
“
What is essential in both Heidegger’s work and Erhard’s is what is unspoken and
therefore essentially nameless. Much of Erhard’s work during the four decades of its
evolution may be seen as the development of new rubrics (distinctions) to replace
those that have devolved into jargon, such that what is said makes present what
cannot be said in words.

SPEAKING BEING
The Forum resumed at 10:30 pm. Erhard began by inviting questions from the
participants. One participant, reviewing The Forum, shared that his already always
listening had altered as a result of that experience.
ERHARD (addressing the group)
He’s got a possibility beyond his thrown listening. He got it by owning his
thrown listening. There’s something called getting off  it. This is a sacred thing.
To get off  it is sacred. Now, what does getting off  it mean? It means he’s not
constrained to entertain that listening. He can hear himself listening and get
off  that listening. When his already always listening comes up, he is able to
own it, to embrace it, to be responsible for it. In the normal course of events,
if I found out my already always listening was disempowering I would try to
stop it. He didn’t change it. That’s the big secret. Because when you change it,
nothing changes.
(shifting tone)
This is a “you-gotta-get-this.” So listen up.
At the chalkboard, Erhard placed the chalk on the surface and moved it, so that
the chalk ended in a diff erent place but a line remained indicating the path of its
movement.
ERHARD (continuing)
Change persists. When you’re diff erent, what persists? That which you’re dif-
ferent than. So when you’re diff erent you’re the same, because the thing from
which you’re diff erent is still there. The more diff erence, the more persistence.
If you’re really diff erent, the thing you’re diff erent than has a big persistence.
If I’m a nice guy as a solution to a problem, the problem for which being a nice
guy is a solution stays in place. About ninety-nine percent of what you are,
you became as a solution to a problem. Education is a solution to being stupid.
When you solve a problem, what persists is the problem.
(to the participant)
So your listening that altered hadn’t solved the problem of your already always
listening.
(to the group)
He had embraced it. He was able to be with the problem.
(drawing two tangent circles on the board)
Can you imagine putting two solid objects in the same place at the same time?
If you did that, what would happen? They would disappear. Push them into

the same space—the space between them—and they will disappear. Anything
you can let be will let you be. There are no accidents of being. You’ve got to be
there for it, open for it, available for it.
DAVID
I wanted to recognize that I haven’t really been listening.
ERHARD
Recognition is the beginning. When you recognize your own already always
listening, you’re on the fi eld. The game’s not over, but you’re on the fi eld.
DAVID
What do I do with my realization?
ERHARD
Nothing. It’ll do something with you. It’ll give you something you didn’t have
before. Most of you ought to be able to map what David said onto your own
listening.
Here Erhard called Kipp to the platform to conduct the next exercise; Erhard
remained nearby, interrupting occasionally to reinforce a point.
KIPP (to the group)
Your job is to sit in your chair, and when I say “now,” describe to yourself
whatever’s happening right now.
(pausing)
Now.
(a minute of silence)
Okay, plenty of data. Let’s have a few people report what they are experiencing
now.
PARTICIPANT
I’m bored and I don’t want to be here.
PARTICIPANT
I’m analyzing a lot.
ERHARD
It’s not you analyzing, it’s it analyzing, because you can’t stop it.
t
PARTICIPANT
What am I supposed to do now?
Forum Day One: Session Five
81
PARTICIPANT
I noticed I was really exhausted.
KIPP
So what you just did was unconceal a fundamental condition that human
beings are. I asked you to sit in your chair and think about what’s happening
right now, and what did you do? By the time you get around to describing
what’s happening right now, it’s gone. Yet everybody stood up authentically,
honestly, and described what happened then but said it was what is now.
There’s no description available for now. So you’ve got to have the representa-
tion. But what’s present is clearly distinct from the representation. And what it
is to be a human being is not to have that distinction. This is what happened at
the party before you got here. The domains of presence and representation got
collapsed. The moment you say what was happening is what is happening, the
representation starts to shape the presence.
ERHARD
What’s the diff erence between now and your representation of now? You
can never describe presence because there’s no description in the realm of
presence. If this isn’t making sense, don’t worry. The valuable stuff  in here
will not make sense. But it’s valid. “Make sense” means “fi ts with what you
already know.” To get what doesn’t make sense requires thinking. What Kipp
is trying to get you to get is that you don’t make any distinction between love
as a presence and love as a story. Is there anybody in the room who can’t see
that existence as a presence is diff erent from existence as a concept or repre-
sentation?
(pausing)
Life exists in the world of concepts and life exists in the world of presence.
But that’s misleading, because the two get collapsed. Something happens,
like a “what happened.” And that devolves into a concept. What happened
back then is never present like a presence. But that’s not clear to you. You
think you’re dealing with what happened when what you’re really dealing
with is your story about what happened. One is not better than the other.
The problem is when they get mixed together. This creates a vicious circle:
the concept of your previous experience now becomes a fi lter for your next
experience, which is now a little less free because it is conceptually shaped.
The conceptually shaped experience reinforces the concept; the reinforced
concept more fully shapes the experience. I’m trying to drive out this seven-
ties bullshit that there’s something wrong with your head. I’m an anti-human
potentialist. I’m not saying that you’re stuck in the concept. I’m saying that
you’re stuck in the vicious circle. I don’t want questions. I want to know:
“Did you get that?”
(pausing)
Good. Everybody got that. So now we’re going to demonstrate what happens
when you’ve got that distinction. Once you get a distinction, it uses you. Three
distinctions to get: one is the realm of existence called presence. The second is
the realm of existence called concept or representation. The third is the vicious
circle. The vicious circle is constructed by a collapse of the fi rst two domains.
(pausing)
We’re going to play a new game. We’re going to do a survey. How many of you
are tired?
(a majority of participants raised their hands)
How many of you have a headache?
(calling on a young woman named Diane)
Would you be willing to participate in a demonstration? Then please come up
here onto the platform.
Diane sat in the second director’s chair that an assistant placed alongside the fi rst.
ERHARD
Would you be willing to have your headache disappear?
DIANE
Yes.
ERHARD
And would you be willing to not know why it disappeared?
DIANE
Okay.
ERHARD
Please close your eyes. How long have you had your headache?
DIANE
Since before the dinner break.
ERHARD
How big is it?
(hesitating, she holds hands outstretched)
Where is it located?
(pointing to her left temple)
What color is it?
82
SPEAKING BEING
DIANE (hesitating)
Brown.
ERHARD
If it had a geometric shape, what would it be?
DIANE
Triangular.
ERHARD
How much water would it hold?
DIANE
About a pint.
ERHARD
On a scale of one to ten, where is it?
DIANE
Six and a half.
ERHARD
Why do you have it?
DIANE
Because it’s been a long day.
ERHARD
Headache and long day live in diff erent realms. You have collapsed them. So,
why do you have a headache?
DIANE
Because I’ve been sitting still.
ERHARD
So you’ve got two domains collapsed. Every time I ask you that stupid question
“Why?” it collapses the two domains.
(repeating this series of questions several times)
How’s your headache now?
DIANE
It’s a four.
ERHARD
How much water would it hold?
DIANE
Still a pint.
ERHARD
It’s critically important that you get it. The headache now and the headache
a moment ago are collapsed together. When she says the headache is “still” a
pint, I know she has collapsed the headache now with the representation of
the headache then.
(continuing to question her regarding the headache’s shape, color and location
right now)
Do you have a headache?
DIANE
No, I don’t.
ERHARD (to the group)
What happened was, I asked her questions which in order to answer she had
to be in the presence of her headache like a presence.
DIANE
I focused on it.
ERHARD
No! What happened was you got the domains uncollapsed. All that happened
was that the headache, instead of showing up in the vicious circle, showed up
distinct in the domain of presence. You looked at your headache. You were
present to the headache. There are no reasons when the headache is like a
presence.
A second demonstration followed with Patricia, a participant who said she was
tired. She sat in one of the director’s chairs; Erhard sat on the arm of his, facing
her.
ERHARD
How tired are you on a scale from one to ten?
Forum Day One: Session Five
83
PATRICIA
Three.
ERHARD
Good. We’re going to leave you at three.
(returning to her seat as the group applauded)
For how many people in the room is something starting to move?
(many hands raising)
For how many people in the room is nothing starting to move?
(more hands)
How many people are at maybe, can’t tell?
(still more hands)
You know where you should be? Where you are?
(pausing)
I’m going to give you an assignment which will determine how much you get
out of The Forum. I got your money. I can’t lose. You can lose. The point is:
you have a chance to enhance what you get out of here. Bring your life in here
tomorrow. Don’t bring the face you brought today—the “I’ve got it all togeth-
er” face. Bring in the face that’s authentic about your own inauthenticity.
What has it cost you in life to collapse those domains? What you’re bringing in
tomorrow is your inauthenticity.
(pausing)
We didn’t talk about looking good today, did we? We’re going to do it in
thirty seconds. You have a major concern for looking good. For some people
looking bad is looking good. So when you come in tomorrow, be able to
talk about where in your life are you used by looking good. Looking good
owns your life.
(pausing)
The four-day format of this Forum is both an asset and a liability. The
liability is that there aren’t five days between the weekends for you to be
back in your lives and talk about your experience. You have got to commu-
nicate what’s happening for you here. You have got to be articulate in this
conversation. Tonight you’ve got to talk about this to other people. You’ve
got to begin to be able to generate the conversation. You’ve got to be able to
speak this. You don’t have to explain it. You want to be in communication
about this like an experience, like a presence. I know a lot of people who
understand this and don’t live it.
PARTICIPANT
It is very late and I am tired.
PATRICIA
A four.
ERHARD
Do you know why you are tired? Notice I didn’t ask you “do you think you
k
know why?” I asked if you know why you’re tired.
PATRICIA
No.
ERHARD
What’s the relationship between the reasons you have for being tired and
being tired? There isn’t any. The reasons are valid. In other words, in the world
of reasons every reason you have is a valid reason. You don’t have any nutty
reasons.
(turning to the group and speaking in a loud voice)
There’s no such thing as tired! That’s a concept!
(back to Patricia)
Where in your body are you experiencing what you used to call being tired?
PATRICIA
My arms.
ERHARD
And where else in your body?
As Erhard repeated the question, she responded each time by identifying a tired
area of her body.
ERHARD
Nothing much conceptual about this, is there? It’s all presence.
PATRICIA
My arms are still tired.
ERHARD
For a while there you were really looking. But then you got to thinking
about it. Whenever you say “still” or “also”... See how easy it is to collapse
the domains?
(continuing to question her)
You were at a four when you started this. Where are you now?
84
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Do you think I give a shit that you’re tired? We’re talking about the rest of your
life and you’re sitting there complaining about being tired. That’s disgusting.
You are disgusting.
(pausing: to the group)
Now that I’ve got your attention. . .
(repeating the assignments)
Let me leave you with a reminder. I have already gotten everything I need out
of this Forum. You have not. You need to be twice as powerful tomorrow. The
way to be twice as powerful is to do these assignments. You gave your word
to be here on time tomorrow. Is that clear? You gave your word to be on time
tomorrow regardless of the circumstances, is that clear?
(to a participant who was standing at the back of the room preparing to leave)
What are you doing at the door with your hat and coat on? You need to be
back in The Forum so we can end The Forum.
The participant returned to her seat in palpable silence.
ERHARD
Thank you.
The fi rst day of The Forum ended.

SPEAKING BEING
the circumstances. There are also moments when we experience freedom from
self-awareness. The diff erence between these two states is relevant to our inquiry
here. Where does the self live when it is not alive in our awareness?
This leads to the second point made here by Heidegger, one which is generally less
apparent than the first: self-reflection is at the same time self-production: “The essential
thing is ‘I will myself’” (EP 64). The human self is not like the human elbow: it is not a
P
ready-made part of the package that accompanies an infant’s arrival in the world. What
is included in the package, although not immediately functional, is language, which pro-
vides the material with which we are eventually able to produce a self. But in a world of
beings with selves, questions about the nature and stability of the self arise persistently,
and recent advances in the study of the human brain, as well as child development, have
informed the inquiry but have not answered the questions. Therefore we note the point
here as a question to be kept open as The Forum proceeds.
Regarding the phenomenon of reflexion, Heidegger says further that it is “Man’s
settling down in one of his essential places,” and he notes with emphasis that it is
characterized by “certainty, certainty” (EP 60). That is, for the most part, human
P
beings are made both secure and comfortable by the condition that their self-knowl-
edge provides. While many of us spend considerable time tinkering with the details
of our identities in the interest of self-improvement, on the whole those identities
give us security. On the whole, we are at home in ourselves.
This, at least, is the way of things in the current paradigm. This interpretation
of the self, however, while self-evident to most of us, is an artifact of a particular way
t
of understanding human being. Indeed, it has been the dominant understanding for
several centuries; and while it is increasingly questioned among people who think
actively about these matters, such as philosophers and other scholars, it remains
the operative understanding for most people in the world—not as something they
bring to mind, or could articulate, but as a way of functioning in their everyday lives.
This particular way of understanding the world, and our place in it, is generally
known as the Cartesian paradigm. It is so called in recognition of the man in whose
thinking the model was crystallized, the seventeenth-century French philosopher
and mathematician Rene Descartes. As a philosopher, Descartes’ job was to engage
in thought experiments; and in one of those experiments—which turned out to be
significant for all of us—he decided that he would place everything in the world in
doubt. His purpose in doing this was to discover what, if anything, was indubitable:
what in the world, in the face of committed skepticism, could retain a quality of
absolute certainty?
END OF DAY ONE INTERVAL
Reflexion: The Cartesian Deficiency
At the outset of Being and Time, Martin Heidegger makes a point that might other-
wise be dismissed as obvious: any inquiry into the nature of Being—such as Werner
Erhard’s project, or Heidegger’s own—must always be conducted by human beings,
who as far as we can tell are the only beings who have a concern for the matter, as
well as the only ones who are capable of inquiring. Humans are therefore involved
at multiple points in the inquiry—as the beings who are questioning, as the beings of
whom the question is asked, and as the beings about whom the question is asked.
t
This point is important because of its implications for the inquiry: it will be char-
acterized throughout by reflexion. Reflexion, or self-referentiality, is an important
idea in the work of both Heidegger and Erhard. The term designates a state in which
we are turned toward our selves, as when confronting a reflection.
d
Reflexion requires, first of all, self-consciousness. To say that human beings are
the only beings for whom their being is an issue, is to say that human beings are the
only beings who are self-conscious—or, to say it more simply, we are the only beings
who have a self. While the consciousness of other animals is likely always to remain
a mystery at some level, it is generally agreed that dogs do not reflect upon their
existence. Here, Heidegger emphasizes the centrality of such reflection to human
awareness:
Consciousness is self-consciousness, and self-consciousness
is ego-consciousness or “we”-consciousness. The essential
thing in this is the re-flexive, and in it the “I,” “we,” “self,”
the presentation-to-self and self-production. (EP 64)
P
“
Two points in this passage should be noted. The first, like many points that
arise in an ontological inquiry, can seem at first both apparent and trivial: one’s
consciousness always includes consciousness of one’s self. That is, in being aware
of my world, I am always at some level aware of my self as the center of my aware-
ness. It is worth taking a moment to notice this, because the nature of the self, and
the quality of its presence in human awareness, will become a central topic as The
Forum proceeds. Clearly, there are moments in life when one’s self-consciousness
becomes intensified, resulting in either pleasure or discomfort, depending upon
Forum Day One: End of Day One Interval 87
The outcome of this experiment led him to the formulation that has come
down to us as his most famous statement, one familiar to almost every university
undergraduate although generally without a clear idea of its implications: I think,
therefore I am (or in Descartes’ original Latin, Cogito, ergo sum).
That is: if I doubt everything, the only thing of which I can be certain is that I
am the doubter. I can know nothing with certainty except myself, as the one who
is thinking. Further, since I am the only certainty, I am also the inevitable arbiter of
what counts as real. In the Cartesian model of human being that emerged from this
experiment—the model that today we inhabit unthinkingly—the cogito, the “I,” the
being who thinks, is the grounding certainty at the center of things. It is the subject
(Latin subjectum, what lies beneath), while out there, independent of the subject, is a
world of objects (objectum, over against). For humans, Being-in-the-world demands
that we determine the true meanings of those objects. Heidegger scholar Michael E.
Zimmerman describes the situation this way:
Although Copernicus had only recently shattered man’s
illusions about being the center of the physical universe,
Descartes established man as the ontological center:
l
henceforth, the reality of the real was what man asserted it
to be. . . . “To be” meant to be conceived by and through the
subject. . . . Everything got determined and evaluated from
the standpoint of man. (“Beyond ‘Humanism’: Heidegger’s
Understanding of Technology” 222)
It is this paradigm, of the fixed and self-certain human subject, that both Heide-
gger and Erhard are placing in question through their work. As Heidegger points out,
Descartes arrived at his conclusion by accepting as given the nature of the sum—
Being, the “I am.” But Heidegger proposes that the nature of “I am” has never been
fully worked out in the history of Western philosophy, so that behind Descartes’ con-
clusion “there lies hidden a failure to master the basic problem of Being” (BT 127).
T
The Cartesian model itself was the result of an experiment in reflexive thinking.
The heart of the subject–object distinction is “I think something” (EP 62) a premise
P
that turns thinking back upon itself, toward the “I,” and thus toward “the presenta-
tion-to-self and self-production” (EP 64). Presentation demands production, since
the “I” is not there to be reflected upon. In reflecting upon my self, I create my self.
“
But in the Cartesian model, the subject is self-certain—that is, certain of itself
as an entity that persists. The clearing for creation has been occupied. Therefore
Heidegger proposes that self-consciousness, which has in Descartes’ model bent
back far enough to see its “I,” must now bend back further and confront the context
in which the “I” stands essentially, a context that puts its self’s certainty in question.
As we will show, the culminating event of The Forum—the unconcealment of
Being—is accomplished through the evocation of a profound bending-back, reveal-
ing not only the context of the “I,” but in a masterful moment of existential rug-pull-
ing, the context of that context as well.

جبه
تأثیر Erhard بر زبان فرهنگ غربی قابل توجه بوده است. اوت
اصطلاحات ، مانند هایدگر ، همیشه غیرمعمول و بسیار هدفمند بوده و
بسیاری از این کلمات و عبارات راهی حوزه عمومی شدند ، برخی به
اثر ماندگار اما این زبان ، در استفاده گاه به گاه ، قدرت خود را از دست داد. هیدگر
این روند انحراف را در وجود و زمان به تفصیل شرح داده است:
جلسه چهار فاصله
من به سختی از کلمه "تحول" استفاده می کنم. بشر بشر بشر چون
در حالی که یک بار کلمه ای بود که مردم باید در مورد آن فکر می کردند ، مبارزه می کنند
برای درک ، کار کردن ، این فقط درست نیست. کلمه دیگر نیست
مردم را بیدار می کند. اکنون ، وقتی می گویید "تحول" ، کلمه
آنها را به خواب می اندازد - مثل اینکه آنها می دانند معنی آن چیست - آنها متوقف می شوند
فکر کردن ، نگاه کردن ، پرس و جو. در عوض ، او گفت ، همانطور که تحقیق هستی شناختی وی توسعه یافته است ، "مفاهیم ادامه می یابد
گفت متفاوت "(سیمون ،" رده چهارم و مربیان: آن را با ورنر دور می کند
Erhard ، "Family Therapy Networker ، مارس - آوریل 1986 ، 30-39)
گفتگو در مورد زبان ، "متن گفتگوی خود با یک محقق ژاپنی.
یک نقطه هایدگر (که در متن به عنوان Inquirer گفته می شود) از دو مورد استفاده می کند
ایده هایی که در کار اولیه او ، هرمنوتیک و پدیدارشناسی اصلی بود. "

به زبانی که وقتی کسی خود را بیان می کند ، در آنجا صحبت می شود
یک درک متوسط ​​است. و مطابق با این هوشیاری
گفتمان که ابلاغ شده است را می توان به یک درک کرد
میزان قابل توجهی ، حتی اگر شنونده خودش را وارد نکند
چنین نوع موجودی نسبت به آنچه در مورد گفتمان است
درک اولیه از آن. ما خیلی نمی فهمیم
موجوداتی که در مورد آنها صحبت می شود ؛ ما در حال حاضر فقط گوش می دهیم
چه چیزی در گفتگوی صحبت می کند. آنچه در صحبت گفته می شود زیر
ایستاد اما آنچه در مورد صحبت است فقط تقریباً درک شده است
و سطحی بشر بشر بشر صحبت بیکار امکان درک است
همه چیز بدون اینکه قبلاً چیزی را بسازد. بشر بشر بشر بنابراین ،
با توجه به ماهیت خود ، گفتگوی بیکار یک بسته شدن است ، زیرا بازگشت به
زمینه آنچه در مورد آن صحبت می شود چیزی است که آن را خنثی می کند. (Bt 212–213)
"
اظهارات Erhard در مصاحبه ای در سال 1986 ، بحث در مورد تکامل خودش
استفاده از زبان ، حساب Echo Heidegger از فرایندی که با استفاده از آن شرایط خود را از دست می دهد
قدرت اصلی بسیاری از کلماتی که او در کار خود استفاده کرده بود ، ارهارد گفت: "حتی-
به طور کامل به استفاده محبوب تبدیل شد. " آنها "قصد خلاقانه پشت سر خود را از دست دادند و
به نوعی ژارگون انحطاط یافته است. " در خارج از متن اصلی آنها ، همانطور که هایدگر بیان کرد
این ، اصطلاحات دیگر به "کلیت مشارکت" که در آن
اهمیت پایه گذاری شد (BT 200). این سرنوشت اصطلاح "تحول" بود ، یک اصطلاح اصلی که Erhard
"معنای بسیار دقیق" را اختصاص داده بود. امروز ، او گفت ، "شما همه آن را می شنوید-
کجا شما در مورد آن در مجلات تجاری می خوانید. این "داغ" است. بنابراین ، تا حدی ، گم شده است
قدرت آن. " وی ادامه داد:
[ژاپنی]: من از این که شما در همین حال شما متعجب تر هستم

"
آنچه در هر دو کار هایدگر و Erhard ضروری است همان چیزی است که ناگفته است و
بنابراین اساساً بی نام است. بخش اعظم کار Erhard در طول چهار دهه آن
تکامل ممکن است به عنوان توسعه مقالات جدید (تمایز) برای جایگزینی دیده شود
آنهایی که به اصطلاحات تبدیل شده اند ، به گونه ای که آنچه گفته می شود باعث می شود چه چیزی
با کلمات نمی توان گفت. 80

این مجمع ساعت 10:30 بعد از ظهر از سر گرفته شد. Erhard با دعوت از سؤالات از
شرکت کنندگان یکی از شرکت کنندگان ، با مرور انجمن ، به اشتراک گذاشت که همیشه او همیشه
گوش دادن در نتیجه آن تجربه تغییر کرده بود. erhard (آدرس دهی به گروه)
او فراتر از گوش دادن به پرتاب خود امکان پذیر است. او آن را با مالکیت خود بدست آورد
گوش دادن به چیزی وجود دارد که از آن خارج می شود. این یک چیز مقدس است. برای پیاده شدن مقدس است. حالا ، پیاده شدن از آن به چه معنی است؟ این بدان معنی است که او نیست
محدود به سرگرمی آن گوش دادن. او می تواند خودش را بشنود که گوش می دهد و می گیرد
از آن گوش دادن وقتی همیشه گوش دادن او به وجود می آید ، او قادر است
صاحب آن ، در آغوش گرفتن آن ، مسئول آن باشید. در دوره عادی وقایع ،
اگر فهمیدم که همیشه گوش دادن من از این امر ناامید کننده بود ، سعی می کردم
جلوی آن را بگیرید. او آن را تغییر نداد. این راز بزرگ است چون وقتی آن را تغییر می دهید ،
هیچ چیز تغییر نمی کند. (تغییر لحن)
این یک "شما-بهت-گیت-این" است. بنابراین گوش کن در تخته گچ ، ارهارد گچ را روی سطح قرار داد و آن را جابجا کرد ، به طوری
گچ در یک مکان متفاوت به پایان رسید اما یک خط باقی مانده است که نشان دهنده مسیر آن است
حرکت erhard (ادامه)
تغییر همچنان ادامه دارد. وقتی تفاوت دارید ، چه چیزی ادامه دارد؟ آنچه شما متفاوت است
ferent از بنابراین وقتی تفاوت دارید ، شما یکسان هستید ، زیرا چیز از
که شما تفاوت دارید هنوز هم وجود دارد. هرچه تفاوت بیشتری داشته باشد ، ماندگاری بیشتری خواهد داشت. اگر واقعاً متفاوت هستید ، چیزی که از پایداری بزرگی برخوردار هستید. اگر من یک پسر خوب به عنوان یک راه حل برای یک مشکل هستم ، مشکلی که خوب است
پسر یک راه حل در محل است. حدود نود و نه درصد از آنچه شما هستید ،
شما به عنوان یک راه حل برای یک مشکل تبدیل شده اید. آموزش و پرورش راه حلی برای احمق بودن است. هنگامی که شما یک مشکل را حل می کنید ، آنچه همچنان ادامه دارد مشکل است. (به شرکت کننده)
بنابراین گوش دادن شما که تغییر یافته است ، همیشه مشکل شما را حل نکرده است
گوش دادن (به گروه)
او آن را در آغوش گرفته بود. او توانست با این مشکل باشد. (ترسیم دو دایره مماس بر روی صفحه)
آیا می توانید تصور کنید که دو شیء جامد را همزمان در همان مکان قرار دهید؟ اگر این کار را کردید ، چه اتفاقی می افتد؟ آنها ناپدید می شوند. آنها را به داخل فشار دهید
روز اول انجمن: جلسه پنجم
همان فضا - فضای بین آنها - و آنها ناپدید می شوند. هر چیزی
شما می توانید اجازه دهید به شما اجازه دهید. هیچ تصادف وجود ندارد. شما باید باشید
در آنجا برای آن ، برای آن باز است ، برای آن در دسترس است. داود
من می خواستم تشخیص دهم که واقعاً گوش نکرده ام. درز
شناخت آغاز است. وقتی همیشه خود را قبلاً تشخیص می دهید
گوش دادن ، شما در FI OLD هستید. بازی تمام نشده است ، اما شما در حال حضور هستید. داود
با تحقق خود چه کار می کنم؟ درز
هیچی این کاری با شما انجام می دهد. این چیزی را که شما ندارید به شما می دهد
قبل بیشتر شما باید بتوانید آنچه را که دیوید به خودتان گفته است نقشه برداری کنید
گوش دادن در اینجا Erhard برای انجام تمرین بعدی KIPP را به سکو فراخواند. درز
در همان نزدیکی باقی ماند و گاهی اوقات برای تقویت یک نقطه قطع شد. kipp (به گروه)
کار شما این است که در صندلی خود بنشینید ، و وقتی می گویم "اکنون" ، خودتان را توصیف کنید
هر چه در حال حاضر اتفاق می افتد (مکث)
اکنون (یک دقیقه سکوت)
خوب ، داده های زیادی. بیایید چند نفر گزارش دهند که چه چیزی را تجربه می کنند
اکنون شرکت کننده
حوصله ام سر رفته و نمی خواهم اینجا باشم. شرکت کننده
من در حال تجزیه و تحلیل زیاد هستم. درز
این تجزیه و تحلیل نیست ، تجزیه و تحلیل می کند ، زیرا نمی توانید جلوی آن را بگیرید. حرف
شرکت کننده
من الان قرار است چه کاری انجام دهم؟ روز اول انجمن: جلسه پنجم
81
شرکت کننده
متوجه شدم که واقعاً خسته شده ام. کله
بنابراین کاری که شما فقط انجام دادید این بود که یک وضعیت اساسی آن انسان باشد
موجودات هستند من از شما خواستم در صندلی خود بنشینید و به آنچه اتفاق می افتد فکر کنید
در حال حاضر ، و شما چه کار کردید؟ تا زمانی که به توصیف خود می روید
آنچه در حال حاضر اتفاق می افتد ، از بین رفته است. با این حال همه به طور واقعی ایستادند ،
صادقانه ، و آنچه را که در آن زمان اتفاق افتاده است توصیف کرد اما گفت که این همان چیزی است که اکنون است. در حال حاضر هیچ توضیحی در دسترس نیست. بنابراین شما باید نمایندگی داشته باشید-
tion اما آنچه موجود است به وضوح از نمایندگی متمایز است. و چه
این است که یک انسان بودن به معنای تمایز نیست. این همان اتفاقی است که در
مهمانی قبل از رسیدن به اینجا. حوزه های حضور و نمایندگی به دست آمد
فرو ریخت لحظه ای که می گویید آنچه اتفاق می افتد همان چیزی است که اتفاق می افتد ،
نمایندگی شروع به شکل دادن به حضور می کند. درز
تفاوت بین اکنون و بازنمایی شما در حال حاضر چیست؟ شما
هرگز نمی تواند حضور را توصیف کند زیرا هیچ توضیحی در قلمرو وجود ندارد
حضور اگر این معنی ندارد ، نگران نباشید. چیزهای ارزشمند در اینجا
منطقی نخواهد بود اما معتبر است "منطقی" به معنای "با آنچه شما هستید
از قبل می دانم. " برای به دست آوردن آنچه که معنی ندارد ، نیاز به فکر کردن دارد.
در تلاش است تا شما را بدست آورد و این است که شما هیچ تمایزی بین عشق ایجاد نمی کنید
به عنوان یک حضور و عشق به عنوان یک داستان. آیا کسی در اتاق وجود دارد که نمی تواند ببیند
این وجود به عنوان یک حضور متفاوت است از وجود وجود به عنوان یک مفهوم یا رعایت
تصمیم؟ (مکث)
زندگی در دنیای مفاهیم وجود دارد و زندگی در دنیای حضور وجود دارد. اما این گمراه کننده است ، زیرا این دو فروپاشیده می شوند. اتفاقی می افتد ،
مثل "اتفاقی که افتاد". و این به یک مفهوم تبدیل می شود. چه اتفاقی افتاد
در آن زمان هرگز مانند حضور حضور ندارد. اما این برای شما مشخص نیست. شما
فکر می کنید با آنچه اتفاق افتاده است با آنچه واقعاً معامله می کنید برخورد می کنید
داستان شما در مورد آنچه اتفاق افتاده است. یکی بهتر از دیگری نیست. مشکل این است که آنها با هم مخلوط می شوند. این یک دایره شرور ایجاد می کند:
مفهوم تجربه قبلی شما اکنون برای بعدی شما تبدیل می شود
تجربه ، که اکنون کمی کمتر آزاد است زیرا از نظر مفهومی شکل دارد. تجربه مفهومی شکل باعث تقویت مفهوم می شود. تقویت شده
مفهوم به طور کامل تجربه را شکل می دهد. من سعی می کنم این هفت را بیرون بیاورم
برهم زدن که مشکلی در سر شما وجود دارد. من یک ضد انسانی هستم
پتانسیل گرا من نمی گویم که شما در این مفهوم گیر کرده اید. من این را می گویم
شما در دایره شریر گیر کرده اید. من س questions ال نمی خواهم من می خواهم بدانم:
"آیا شما آن را گرفتید؟"
(مکث)
خوب همه این کار را کردند. بنابراین اکنون می خواهیم نشان دهیم که چه اتفاقی می افتد
وقتی این تمایز را دارید. پس از تمایز ، از شما استفاده می کند. سه
تمایزات برای بدست آوردن: یکی قلمرو وجود به نام حضور است. دوم است
قلمرو وجود نامیده می شود مفهوم یا بازنمایی. سوم شرور است
دایره. دایره شریر با فروپاشی دو حوزه اول ساخته شده است. (مکث)
ما قصد داریم یک بازی جدید انجام دهیم. ما قصد داریم یک نظرسنجی انجام دهیم. چند نفر از شما
خسته شده اند؟ (اکثر شرکت کنندگان دست خود را بلند کردند)
چند نفر از شما سردرد دارید؟ (تماس با یک زن جوان به نام دایان)
آیا مایل به شرکت در یک تظاهرات هستید؟ پس لطفا بالا بیایید
در اینجا روی سکو. دایان در صندلی کارگردان دوم نشسته بود که یک دستیار در کنار اول قرار گرفت. درز
آیا حاضرید سردرد خود را ناپدید کنید؟ دایان
بله درز
و آیا حاضرید نمی دانید چرا ناپدید شد؟ دایان
خوب درز
لطفا چشمان خود را ببندید. چه مدت سردرد خود را دارید؟ دایان
از قبل از استراحت شام. درز
چقدر بزرگ است؟ (تردید ، او دستان خود را دراز می کند)
کجا واقع شده است؟ (با اشاره به معبد سمت چپ او)
چه رنگی است؟ 82
وجود
دایان (تردید)
قهوه ای درز
اگر شکل هندسی داشت ، چه خواهد بود؟ دایان
مثلثی درز
چقدر آب نگه می دارد؟ دایان
در مورد یک پین درز
در مقیاس یک تا ده ، کجاست؟ دایان
شش و نیم درز
چرا آن را دارید؟ دایان
زیرا یک روز طولانی است درز
سردرد و روز طولانی در قلمروهای مختلف زندگی می کنند. شما آنها را فرو ریخته اید. بنابراین ،
چرا سردرد دارید؟ دایان
چون من هنوز نشسته ام. درز
بنابراین شما دو دامنه فرو ریخته اید. هر وقت از شما آن سوال احمقانه می پرسم
"چرا؟" این دو حوزه فرو می ریزد. (تکرار این سری سوالات چندین بار)
اکنون سردرد شما چطور است؟ دایان
این چهار است درز
چقدر آب نگه می دارد؟ دایان
هنوز هم یک پینت درز
این بسیار مهم است که آن را بدست آورید. اکنون سردرد و سردرد
لحظه ای پیش با هم فرو ریخته است. وقتی او می گوید سردرد "هنوز" است
پین ، من می دانم که او اکنون با نمایندگی از سردرد فروپاشیده است
سردرد پس از آن. (ادامه سؤال از او در مورد شکل ، رنگ و مکان سردرد
در حال حاضر)
آیا سردرد دارید؟ دایان
نه ، من نمی کنم erhard (به گروه)
چه اتفاقی افتاد ، من سوالات او را پرسیدم که برای پاسخ دادن به او
برای حضور در سردرد او مانند حضور. دایان
من روی آن تمرکز کردم. درز
نه! اتفاقی که افتاد این بود که شما دامنه ها را بدون جمع نکردید. تمام آنچه اتفاق افتاد
این بود که سردرد ، به جای اینکه در دایره شرور ظاهر شود ، نشان داد
متمایز در حوزه حضور. شما به سردرد خود نگاه کردید. تو بودی
در سردرد موجود است. هیچ دلیلی وجود ندارد که سردرد مانند یک است
حضور تظاهرات دوم با پاتریشیا ، یک شرکت کننده که گفت او بوده است
خسته او در یکی از صندلی های کارگردان نشسته بود. ارهارد روی بازوی او نشسته بود.
او درز
چقدر از یک تا ده در مقیاس خسته هستید؟ روز اول انجمن: جلسه پنجم
83
پاتریشیا
سه درز
خوب ما می خواهیم شما را در سه نفر ترک کنیم. (بازگشت به صندلی خود به عنوان گروه تحسین می کند)
برای چند نفر در اتاق چیزی شروع به حرکت می کند؟ (بسیاری از دستان بالا)
برای چند نفر از افراد در اتاق چیزی شروع به حرکت نمی کند؟ (دست بیشتر)
شاید چند نفر در آن باشند ، نمی توانند بگویند؟ (هنوز دست بیشتر)
شما می دانید کجا باید باشید؟ کجا هستی؟ (مکث)
من می خواهم به شما تکلیفی بدهم که تعیین می کند چقدر دریافت می کنید
خارج از انجمن من پول شما را گرفتم نمی توانم ضرر کنم شما می توانید از دست بدهید. نکته این است:
شما فرصتی برای تقویت آنچه از اینجا خارج می شوید ، دارید. زندگی خود را اینجا بیاورید
فردا چهره ای را که امروز آورده اید بیاورید- "من همه چیز را به دست آورده ام-
چهره. چهره ای را که در مورد عدم اطمینان خود معتبر است ، بیاورید
فردا عدم اطمینان شماست. (مکث)
ما امروز در مورد خوب به نظر نمی رسیدیم ، آیا؟ ما قصد داریم این کار را انجام دهیم
سی ثانیه شما نگرانی عمده ای برای خوب به نظر رسیدن دارید. برای بعضی از افراد
بد به نظر می رسد خوب است. بنابراین وقتی فردا وارد می شوید ، قادر خواهید بود
با نگاه خوب در مورد اینکه در زندگی خود از کجا استفاده می کنید صحبت کنید. خوب نگاه کردن
صاحب زندگی شما است. (مکث)
قالب چهار روزه این انجمن هم دارایی و هم یک مسئولیت است. در
مسئولیت این است که بین آخر هفته ها پنج روز برای شما وجود ندارد
به زندگی خود برگردید و در مورد تجربه خود صحبت کنید. شما باید
آنچه در اینجا برای شما اتفاق می افتد را نفی کنید. شما باید در این مورد مفصل باشید
مکالمه امشب باید در مورد این موضوع با افراد دیگر صحبت کنید. شما
باید شروع به ایجاد مکالمه کنیم. شما باید بتوانید
این را صحبت کن لازم نیست آن را توضیح دهید. شما می خواهید در ارتباط باشید
در مورد این مانند یک تجربه ، مانند حضور. من افراد زیادی را می شناسم که
این را درک کنید و آن را زندگی نکنید. شرکت کننده
خیلی دیر است و من خسته ام. پاتریشیا
چهار درز
آیا می دانید چرا خسته شده اید؟ توجه داشته باشید من از شما سؤال نکردم "آیا فکر می کنید شما
k
می دانید چرا؟ " من پرسیدم که آیا می دانید چرا پاتریشیا خسته شده اید.
شماره erhard
چه ارتباطی بین دلایلی که شما برای خستگی دارید و
خسته شده اید؟ هیچ چیز وجود ندارد دلایل معتبر هستند به عبارت دیگر ، در جهان
از دلایلی که هر دلیلی که دارید یک دلیل معتبر است. شما هیچ چیز مغذی ندارید
دلایل (روی آوردن به گروه و صحبت با صدای بلند)
هیچ چیز خسته ای وجود ندارد! این یک مفهوم است! (بازگشت به پاتریشیا)
کجا در بدن خود آنچه را که قبلاً خسته شده اید تجربه می کنید؟ پاتریشیا
بازوهایم درز
و کجا دیگر در بدن شما؟ همانطور که ارهارد این سؤال را تکرار کرد ، او هر بار با شناسایی یک خسته پاسخ می داد
ناحیه بدن او. درز
هیچ چیز مفهومی در این مورد وجود ندارد ، وجود دارد؟ این همه حضور است پاتریشیا
بازوهایم هنوز خسته است. درز
مدتی در آنجا واقعاً به دنبالش بود. اما پس از آن شما به فکر کردن رسیدید
در مورد آن هر وقت می گویید "هنوز" یا "همچنین" ... ببینید سقوط چقدر آسان است
دامنه ها؟ (ادامه سؤال از او)
وقتی این کار را شروع کردید در یک چهار نفر بودید. الان کجا هستی؟ 84
وجود
درز
آیا فکر می کنید من یک گه می دهم که شما خسته هستید؟ ما در مورد بقیه شما صحبت می کنیم
زندگی و شما در آنجا نشسته اید و از خسته شدن شکایت می کنید. این منزجر کننده است شما منزجر کننده هستید (مکث: به گروه)
حالا که توجه شما را جلب کرده ام. بشر بشر (تکرار تکالیف)
بگذارید با یادآوری شما را ترک کنم. من قبلاً هر آنچه را که نیاز دارم بدست آورده ام
از این انجمن شما ندارید شما باید فردا دو برابر قدرتمند باشید. در
راهی برای دو برابر قدرتمند بودن انجام این تکالیف است. شما حرف خود را دادید
فردا به موقع اینجا باشم. آیا این واضح است؟ شما حرف خود را دادید تا به موقع باشید
فردا صرف نظر از شرایط ، آیا این مشخص است؟ (به یک شرکت کننده که در پشت اتاق ایستاده بود و آماده تر شدن است)
با کلاه و کت خود در در چه کاری انجام می دهید؟ شما باید باشید
به انجمن بازگردیم تا بتوانیم به انجمن پایان دهیم. شرکت کننده در سکوت قابل لمس به صندلی خود بازگشت. درز
ممنون روز اول انجمن به پایان رسید. 86
وجود
شرایط همچنین لحظاتی وجود دارد که ما آزادی را تجربه می کنیم
خودآگاهی تفاوت بین این دو کشور مربوط به تحقیق ما است
اینجا وقتی در آگاهی ما زنده نیست ، خود کجا زندگی می کند؟ این منجر به نکته دوم در اینجا هایدگر می شود ، که به طور کلی کمتر است
ظاهراً از اول: خود بازتاب در همان زمان خود تولید است: "ضروری است
چیز این است که "من خودم خواهم بود" "(قسمت 64). خود انسان مانند آرنج انسان نیست: این یک نیست
پ
بخش آماده بسته ای که همراه با ورود نوزاد به جهان است. چه
در بسته گنجانده شده است ، اگرچه بلافاصله کاربردی نیست ، اما زبان است.
از موادی که در نهایت قادر به تولید خود هستیم ، استفاده می کند. اما در دنیایی از
موجوداتی با خود ، سؤالاتی در مورد ماهیت و ثبات خود به طور مداوم بوجود می آیند ،
و پیشرفت های اخیر در مطالعه مغز انسان و همچنین رشد کودک
پرس و جو را مطلع کرد اما به سوالات پاسخ نداده است. بنابراین ما نکته را یادداشت می کنیم
در اینجا به عنوان سؤالی که باید با ادامه انجمن باز شود. با توجه به پدیده بازتاب ، هایدگر می گوید "این است" انسان است
حل و فصل در یکی از مکانهای اساسی او ، "و او با تأکید بر اینکه این است
با "یقین ، یقین" مشخص می شود (قسمت 60). یعنی بیشتر انسان
پ
موجودات به شرط آگاهی از خودشان ایمن و راحت ساخته می شوند
لبه فراهم می کند. در حالی که بسیاری از ما زمان قابل توجهی را صرف می کنیم تا جزئیات را در دست بگیریم
از هویت ما به نفع خود بهبودی ، در کل این هویت ها
به ما امنیت بدهید. در کل ، ما در خانه خودمان هستیم. این حداقل ، راه چیزها در الگوی فعلی است. این تفسیر
از خود ، با این حال ، در حالی که بیشتر ما به نظر می رسد ، مصنوعی از یک روش خاص است
حرف
درک انسان در واقع ، این درک غالب برای
چند قرن ؛ و در حالی که به طور فزاینده ای در بین افرادی که فکر می کنند سؤال می شود
به طور فعال در مورد این امور ، مانند فیلسوفان و سایر دانشمندان ، همچنان باقی مانده است
درک عملیاتی برای اکثر مردم جهان - نه به عنوان چیزی که آنها
به ذهن بیاورید ، یا می تواند بیان کند ، اما به عنوان راهی برای عملکرد در زندگی روزمره آنها. این روش خاص برای درک جهان و جایگاه ما در آن به طور کلی است
معروف به الگوی دکارتی. این به اصطلاح به رسمیت شناخته شده از مردی است که در آن
فکر کردن این مدل متبلور شد ، فیلسوف فرانسوی قرن هفدهم
و ریاضیدان رنه دکارت. به عنوان یک فیلسوف ، کار دکارت مشغول کار بود
در آزمایش های فکری ؛ و در یکی از آن آزمایشات - که معلوم شد
برای همه ما قابل توجه است - او تصمیم گرفت که او همه چیز را در جهان قرار دهد
شک هدف او در انجام این کار کشف این بود که چه چیزی ، در هر صورت ، غیرقابل انکار بود:
آنچه در جهان ، در مقابل شک و تردید متعهد ، می تواند کیفیت را حفظ کند
یقین مطلق؟ پایان روز یک بازه
بازتاب: کمبود دکارتی
در ابتدای وجود و زمان ، مارتین هایدگر نکته ای را بیان می کند که ممکن است از دیگر
عاقلانه به عنوان واضح رد می شود: هرگونه تحقیق در مورد ماهیت بودن - مانند ورنر
پروژه Erhard ، یا خود Heidegger - باید همیشه توسط انسانها انجام شود ،
چه کسی تا آنجا که ما می توانیم بگوییم تنها موجوداتی هستند که نگران این موضوع هستند ، مانند
و همچنین تنها کسانی که قادر به پرس و جو هستند. بنابراین انسانها درگیر هستند
در چندین نقطه در استعلام - به عنوان موجوداتی که از آنها سؤال می کنند ، به عنوان موجودات
از چه کسی سؤال می شود ، و به عنوان موجوداتی درباره این سؤال که پرسیده می شود. حرف
این نکته به دلیل پیامدهای آن برای استعلام مهم است:
در کل توسط بازتاب. انعکاس یا خود ارجاعی مهم است
ایده در کار هایدگر و ارهارد. این اصطلاح وضعیتی را تعیین می کند که در آن
ما به سمت خودمان چرخانده شده ایم ، مانند هنگام مقابله با بازتاب. د
بازگرداندن ، اول از همه ، خودآگاهی است. گفتن اینکه انسانها هستند
تنها موجوداتی که وجود آنها مسئله ای است ، این است که بگویند انسان ها هستند
فقط موجوداتی که خودآگاه هستند-یا برای گفتن ساده تر ، ما تنها موجودات هستیم
که خود را دارند در حالی که احتمالاً آگاهی از حیوانات دیگر همیشه باقی خواهد ماند
یک رمز و راز در برخی از سطوح ، به طور کلی توافق می شود که سگ ها به آنها تأمل نمی کنند
وجود در اینجا ، هایدگر بر مرکزیت چنین تأملاتی به انسان تأکید می کند
آگاهی:
آگاهی خودآگاهی و خودآگاهی است
خودآگاهی یا آگاهی "ما" است. ضروری
نکته در این مورد دوباره فلش است ، و در آن "من" ، "ما" ، "خود" ، "
ارائه به خود و خود تولید. (قسمت 64)
پ
"
دو نکته در این قسمت باید ذکر شود. اولین ، مانند بسیاری از نکات که
در یک تحقیق هستی شناختی بوجود می آید ، در ابتدا هم ظاهری و هم بی اهمیت به نظر می رسد: یک نفر
آگاهی همیشه شامل آگاهی از خود شخص است. یعنی در آگاهی
از دنیای من ، من همیشه در بعضی از افراد از خودم به عنوان مرکز آگاهی خودم آگاه هستم-
ness ارزش آن را دارد که لحظه ای متوجه این موضوع شوید ، زیرا ماهیت خود ، و
کیفیت حضور آن در آگاهی انسان ، به عنوان یک موضوع اصلی تبدیل خواهد شد
درآمدهای انجمن واضح است ، لحظاتی در زندگی وجود دارد که خودآگاهی شخص است
شدت می یابد ، بسته به نوع لذت یا ناراحتی می شود
روز اول انجمن: پایان روز یک بازه 87
نتیجه این آزمایش او را به سمت فرمولاسی که آمده است ، سوق داد
به عنوان مشهورترین جمله او ، یکی از آنها تقریباً برای هر دانشگاه آشنا است
کارشناسی گرچه به طور کلی بدون ایده روشنی از پیامدهای آن: من فکر می کنم ،
بنابراین من هستم (یا در لاتین اصلی دکارت ، Cogito ، Ergo Sum). یعنی: اگر به همه چیز شک دارم ، تنها چیزی که می توانم مطمئن باشم این است که من
من تردید هستم من نمی توانم با یقین چیزی جز خودم بدانم ، به عنوان کسی که
فکر می کند علاوه بر این ، از آنجا که من تنها یقین هستم ، من نیز داور اجتناب ناپذیر هستم
آنچه واقعی است. در الگوی دکارتی انسان که از این نتیجه گرفته شده است
آزمایش - الگویی که امروز ما به طور غیرقابل تصور ساکن هستیم - Cogito ، "من"
بودن که فکر می کند ، اطمینان اساسی در مرکز امور است. این موضوع است
(موضوع لاتین ، آنچه در زیر آن نهفته است) ، در حالی که در آنجا ، مستقل از موضوع است ،
دنیای اشیاء (Objectum ، در برابر). برای انسان ، خواستار بودن در جهان است
که معانی واقعی آن اشیاء را تعیین می کنیم. دانشمند هایدگر مایکل E. زیمرمن وضعیت را از این طریق توصیف می کند:
اگرچه کپرنیک فقط اخیراً انسان را خرد کرده بود
توهمات در مورد مرکز بودن جهان فیزیکی ،
دکارت انسان را به عنوان مرکز هستی شناختی تأسیس کرد:
سعادت
از این پس ، واقعیت واقعی همان چیزی بود که انسان آن را ادعا کرد
بودن بشر بشر بشر "به معنای" بودن توسط و از طریق
موضوع بشر بشر بشر همه چیز از آن تعیین و ارزیابی شد
دیدگاه انسان. ("فراتر از" اومانیسم ": هایدگر
درک فناوری "222)
این پارادایم ، از موضوع انسانی ثابت و خودمختار است که هر دو هاید
Gger و Erhard از طریق کار خود سؤال می کنند. همانطور که هایدگر اشاره می کند ،
دکارت با پذیرش با توجه به ماهیت مبلغ به نتیجه گیری خود رسید -
بودن ، "من هستم". اما هایدگر پیشنهاد می کند که ماهیت "من هستم" هرگز نبوده است
کاملاً در تاریخ فلسفه غربی کار کرده است ، به طوری که در پشت دکارت
Clusion "وجود دارد که عدم موفقیت در تسلط بر مشکل اساسی بودن" (BT 127). حرف
خود مدل دکارتی نتیجه آزمایش در تفکر بازتابی بود. قلب موضوع - تمایز "من فکر می کنم چیزی" (قسمت 62) یک فرض است
پ
این فکر به خود ، به سمت "من" و به این ترتیب به سمت "ارائه-
Tion-to-Self و خود تولید "(EP 64). ارائه نیاز به تولید دارد ، زیرا
"من" در آنجا نیست که منعکس شود. در تأمل بر خودم ، خودم را خلق می کنم. "
اما در مدل دکارتی ، موضوع خود را مطمئن می کند-یعنی خاص خود
به عنوان موجودی که همچنان ادامه دارد. پاکسازی برای خلقت اشغال شده است. از این رو
هایدگر آن خودآگاهی را که در مدل دکارت خم شده است پیشنهاد می کند
به اندازه کافی دور برای دیدن "من" آن ، اکنون باید بیشتر خم شود و با زمینه مقابله کنید
که در آن "من" اساساً ایستاده است ، زمینه ای که اطمینان خود را زیر سوال می برد. همانطور که نشان خواهیم داد ، رویداد اوج بخش این انجمن - عدم حضور
بودن-از طریق برانگیختن یک خم شدن عمیق ، آشکار می شود
نه تنها زمینه "من" بلکه در یک لحظه استادانه از فرش وجودی-
زمینه ، زمینه آن زمینه نیز.
