Forum Day Three: Session Three 225
ANGEL
Nothing.
ERHARD
Oh bullshit.
KIPP
Try again. Stand up.
ERHARD
You’re a long way from nothing. When he’s done...
ANGEL (angrily)
So what?
ERHARD
When he’s done with you, you may get to nothing. Right now you’re something.
ANGEL
Why is it important for me to be nothing?
KIPP
Well, how is something treating you right now?
ANGEL
I don’t know how to be nothing.
ERHARD (interrupting Kipp to address the group)
What you’re watching, what this is designed to do, is to let you look down to the very
foundation of what the already always being of human beings is. You’re going to get to see
whence you came. In this conversation—it’s gonna take hours, and given how stupid you are,
it’s gonna take a lot of hours—and what you’re going to see if you’re watching, is whence you
came. I mean you. What a “you” is, what an “I” is, what a “me” is. This is whence it comes.
Remember what I said earlier about working backwards? We’re going to get all the way
down to the bottom, to the source of you. And this is the conversation in which we’re going to
do it. And if you watch here, and map this on to your own life, you’ll get to see where you
came from.
(pausing)
This is where you came from. You didn’t come from your mother. You got your body from your
mother. This is where you came from. Remember I told you the fi rst half of The Forum was
the already always being of human being? This is you “already always.” She sat down yesterday
beautifully unstuck. Now she’s as stuck as she was yesterday. By the time we fi nish this
conversation most of you will be unstuck. And by tomorrow you will be stuck again. Because
What you’re watching, what this is designed to
do, is to let you look down to the very founda-
tion of what the already always being of human
beings is.

SPEAKING BEING
that’s what it is to be human. To be stuck. You don’t like it, too bad. Stay in California. Then you
can play stuck trying to get unstuck. You understand stuck trying to get unstuck?
(very loudly)
You are stuck trying to get unstuck, you asshole!
KIPP
So Angel, what did you give meaning to?
ANGEL
Life.
KIPP
No. You were going along fi ne, right?
ANGEL
I was going along great.
KIPP
That’s right, you were going along great.
ERHARD
And you made going along great mean something, didn’t you?
ANGEL
Yes.
ERHARD
Yeah, you turned it into a fucking soap opera. You want to get that, you want to get that real
clear because you’re going to do the same thing. You will do it. I’m not telling you about it so
that you won’t do it. That’ll make a fool out of me. ‘Cause you will do it. Remember I said “ride
the horse in the direction it’s going”? I walk out to the street and watch for which way the traffi  c
is going. I point in the direction it’s going. Someone says, “Jesus, that guy makes the traffi  c go
in that direction. Look at that guy! He makes everything go the way he makes it go.” I’m just
telling you so that I’m pointing in the direction you’re going anyhow. No sense pointing in the
other direction. That’s stupid.
KIPP
So, you made what mean something?
ANGEL
That I don’t care.
The Violence of Meaning
Human beings are the animals with language. As a result, we
awake daily into a meaningful understanding of the world. We
assign meaning to everything that exists and everything that
occurs; we are compelled to know what things mean, and cannot
stand not to know.
To understand the depth of our attachment to meaning,
consider Martin Heidegger’s view: language was not a property
that was somehow granted to human beings; it was only through
language that human beings became human beings. The impulse
to mean and know is constitutive of our being. It is so much the
way we are that we cannot recognize its downside, which is that
our death-grip on meaning is the source of most of our problems.
So in any deep exploration of human being, such as that
conducted in The Forum, it is essential to consider the function
of meaning, as well as the process by which meanings emerge in
the world, and are—or are not—maintained there. How did the
world occur; how did human beings occur? In the writing of the
pre-Socratic Greek philosophers, Heidegger finds this perspective:
the beings currently in the world are there because human beings
spoke them into being. Further, in doing so, we were at the same
time creating ourselves as human beings.
