SPEAKING BEING
makes you and me the way we are? The standard interpretation as to how you and I got to
be the way we are has no power. It gives me nothing to say about it. I can’t talk myself into
being. A lot of the lack of freedom is constituted in your relationship with your parents.
The single most important learning experience in my life was doing programs with teenag-
ers. The ten-day course for teenagers we used to do in the mountains—let me tell you what
I found out about teenagers. After ten days, you find out that the single most important
thing in your life is that you love your mother and father. And that’s no shit. And there’s
very little structure in a teenager’s life to express that. You’ve got to get that resolved, and if
you’re smart you’ll get it resolved tonight. We’ll let you out of here early enough to call your
mother, call your father.
(forcefully

)
You just gotta get off  it. You’re wasting your time and money in here if you’re going to stay on it
with your parents.
(in response to a question about what it means to be complete)
What I meant by being complete... your parents have got to be all right with you exactly the way
they are. Your parents don’t owe you a thing. They don’t owe you their love. You are not entitled
to your parents’ love. You owe them. I know, it’s a bitch. I don’t like it either. I don’t like gravity.
I don’t like being tied down. Gravity doesn’t care. It’s the way it is. Until you are complete with
your parents you can’t be yourself. Just loving them isn’t enough. You’ve got to be able to fully
be with your parents the way they are. You know, I spent most of my life tied to my mother’s
apron strings. And she had very long apron strings. I deserted my family. They didn’t know
where I was. Gone for years. I was still my mother’s little boy. I didn’t grow up till I was thirty
something.
Here Erhard acknowledged a nineteen-year-old participant who had shared about his relationship
with his parents for being complete with them at an early age.
ERHARD (continuing)
I don’t know if you can see it or not, but until that happens you aren’t anything but your moth-
er’s little boy.
Erhard left the room at this point, and Wes took the platform.
WES
We’re now in the bonus category. This goes beyond The Forum. Look at your relationship with
your parents from the question: “Are they really all right with me?” What do you have to get off
with them? Being complete never leaves anybody with something dumped on them. Use the din-
ner break to complete with your parents.  Find a telephone. Reach them. If your parents are not
alive, fi nd someone with whom you are incomplete and complete with them. Is anybody unclear?
As Erhard returned to the room, Jane, a teenage participant, rose and spoke, her manner very shy
and serious.
of the they-self governs. As participants share and disclose their
stories, as they own up to and appropriate the ways they wound
up being (owning their “thrownness”—see the next sidebar), and
further, as they grasp and admit the harm that justifying these
ways of being has wrought: the “social mood” of profound aff inity
gets evoked. ■

JANE
I don’t understand about being complete with your parents.
WES
Are your parents all right with you the way they are?
JANE
Yeah.
WES
So what’s the problem?
ERHARD (gently)
Jane, there’s something going on with you about your parents, isn’t there?
JANE (very tentative)
I don’t know.
ERHARD
Does it feel like there is?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
So what’s going on?
JANE
I don’t know. Something from the past?
ERHARD
Is there something that feels badly for you?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
What is it?
JANE
The only thing I can think of is my stepmom, the way they brought her into my life.
THROWNNESS
Thrownness is a central Heideggerian term that Werner Erhard uses
extensively in responding to the first question of The Forum: What
is the Being of human beings?
In Being and Time, thrownness is a fundamental aspect of
Dasein’s existence; Erhard calls it “the default clearing” for human
beings (Author notes, Intro to 6-Day LA 1989). “In thrownness,”
says Heidegger “it is revealed that in each case Dasein, as my
Dasein and this Dasein, is already in a definite world and alongside
a definite range of definite entities within-the-world” (BT 264
T
).
Thrownness determines Dasein’s options in life, and there are no
others: “As something thrown, Dasein has been thrown into exis-
tence. It exists as an entity which has to be as it is and as it can be”
(BT 321
T
), and further, “it has been brought into its ‘there,’ but not
of its own accord” (BT 329
T
).
The word “thrownness” expresses the way we wound up
being, the way we find ourselves to always already be: thrownness
determines what we automatically are, and it limits our future
possibilities (what we “can be”). It is the ontological clearing which
Being has sent in our time. “We’ve got only the possibility which
we inherited,” says Erhard, “the possibility into which we were
thrown—we’re thrown to be this particular way, we’re thrown into
this kind of being that has this particular set of options” (“The
Heart of the Matter”).
Heidegger says that these options are not objective brute facts
about the environment into which we are thrown; that would be the
factuality of the situation, and we might discover those facts if we
y
looked for them. But Dasein’s thrownness “is meant to suggest the
facticity of its being delivered-over” (BT 174). We live in the facticity, the
T
way we
y
wound up being, and not the factuality; we don’t see the raw
data of the environment, we see a story about the world. This is our
y
facticity: that we are thrown, and that our thrownness is not deter-
mined by the things or circumstances “out there.” Rather it is char-
acteristic of Dasein’s way of Being-in-the-world. Dasein has wound
up whatever way it wound up being, and to perpetuate itself, Dasein
must avoid owning up to what it costs to self-justify this thrown way
of being. From the point of view of the way we
y
wound up being, then,

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
So let’s talk about that a bit. What happened?
JANE
My dad came home with her. He was gone for a while, and he said “this is your mom.” That’s it.
No questions.
ERHARD
And what did you say to yourself?
JANE
Fine.
ERHARD
Did you? Did you stuff  it?
JANE
Well I thought that maybe he brought her in so that I would have a mom, ’cause my parents got
a divorce, and then two months later my real mom died. And I feel like he brought her into my
life.
ERHARD
Is what you’re feeling badly about...
JANE
But my mom loves me. I’m glad for half the things she does. But at the time I thought, “she’s
such a bitch, why is she doing this?” And I wanted to just run away. Now I realize she loved me,
and that she wasn’t trying to replace my real mom.
ERHARD
Good. It doesn’t mean that your mother is not weird. Because we’re all weird, right, you’ve seen
that in here. But your mother loves you, and she’s weird. With your mother, it’s got to be that
she’s all right just like she is. I didn’t say she was right to be the way she is. My mother didn’t do
the stupid things she did with me because she loved me. She did the stupid things she did with
me because she was stupid. And she loved me. It’s not that she was right. So you’ve got a little
bit of a ploy in there about making your mother right for the way she is, you all. So, any better
sense of what that sadness is? Does it have to do with your mother and father’s divorce?
JANE
I don’t remember that.
ERHARD
Does it have to do with your mother dying?
ontological inquiry—the kind of speaking that evokes Being—occurs
as something to turn away from, to try to leap over.
Indeed, Heidegger is emphatic about the centrality of our
facticity in determining our existence. Our mood, our state-of-
mind, the way we understand our world—from the phenomeno-
logical perspective—those are the facts: “[M]ood brings Dasein
before the ‘that-it-is’ of its ‘there,’ which, as such, stares it in
the face with the inexorability of an enigma.” Even if Dasein
strives for “rational enlightenment,” tries for a detached stand-
point, and tells himself that, really, it’s just a mood—“all this
counts for nothing as against the phenomenal facts of the case”
(BT 175
T
).
Hubert Dreyfus, in his reading of Being and Time, chooses to
translate Heidegger’s Befindlichkeit as aff ectedness rather than state-
t
of-mind. The latter phrase, he feels, suggests a private subjective
mental state, when what Heidegger is distinguishing is Dasein’s
“being found in a situation where things and options already matter”
(Being In The World 168). This is an important point. In our thrown-
d
ness, things are encountered as already and always meaningful:
Letting something be encountered is primarily
circumspective; it is not just sensing some-
thing, or staring at it. It implies circumspec-
tive concern, and has the character of becom-
ing aff ected in some way. . . . Being-in as such
has been determined existentially beforehand
in such a manner that what it encounters
within-the-world can “matter” to it in this
way. (BT 176)
“
Heidegger’s point is that our moods, like our states of mind, are
not the subjective individual phenomena found in a Cartesian
model of human being. For Heidegger, a mood “comes neither
from the ‘outside’ or ‘inside,’ but arises out of Being-in-the-world,
as a way of such Being” (BT 176
T
).
Our thrown way of being is not one that we could make
explicit or theorize. It is not based upon beliefs, and human
Forum Day Two: Session Three
161
JANE
I remember that, but I remember more my stepmom coming into my life. And my mom dying.
ERHARD
Did you love your real mom?
JANE
I don’t really remember. I thought I did. I don’t remember her.
ERHARD
So is there anything incomplete with your real mother?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
You’re okay with her?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Your dad?
JANE
I’m complete with him.
ERHARD
Your stepmom?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
You notice the almost stupid “not”? She didn’t have to be stupid there. Not “I guess.” And that’s
from the beginning because she just showed up and you didn’t have a chance to build a relation-
ship. Like here’s your mother. Have you built a relationship since then?
JANE
Yeah.
beings do not, for the most part, subject our everyday actions
to analysis. We simply engage in the practices of our inherited
traditions, the tradition into which we have been thrown. But
our understanding of ourselves remains superficial: “Ontical-
ly, of course, Dasein is not only close to us—even that which
is closest. We are it, each of us, we ourselves. In spite of this,
or rather for just this reason, it is ontologically that which is
farthest” (BT 36
T
).
Dreyfus has proposed examples of the way we inherit
elements of this thrownness. A Japanese mother comforts her
baby in the manner of her culture, in quiet and soothing ways,
while her American counterpart stimulates her baby into more
active and vocal behaviors. These parenting choices are, in large
part, unconscious on the part of the mothers; they are simply
reproducing their cultures’ ways of being. Nevertheless, by
the time the infants are three to four months of age, they have
already learned to be Japanese and American infants (Being In
The World 17). In another example, Dreyfus proposes that all of
d
the implicit but important rules governing nonverbal behaviors,
which differ widely among cultures—such aspects of proxemics
as the appropriate distance to stand from others, the relative
desirability of direct eye contact, or the situational expectations
regarding touch—are learned by unconscious observation as we
mature within a culture (Being in the World 18). These rules be-
come inculcated long before we might explicitly reflect on them,
and by then, Dasein’s everyday existence is already determined
factically, along with the social moods that shape our options
for being with others in the world.
It is important here to note that thrownness, like other
ideas introduced by Heidegger to distinguish Dasein’s existence,
should not be interpreted as a negative state of Being. Given its
apparent limitations, this is counterintuitive, and challenging for
us to think. But such paradoxical languaging is crucial to under-
standing the thinking of both Heidegger and Erhard. Negative
conditions naturally lead to the human impulse...to “fix” them,
but both Heidegger and Werner Erhard propose a more unortho-
dox response. ■
162
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
So what’s incomplete there?
JANE
I don’t know. I have a relationship with her. But I don’t know what’s incomplete.
ERHARD
How old were you when she became your mother?
JANE
Four, or fi ve, or six.
ERHARD
Did you lose something back there?
JANE
Back when I was a kid?
ERHARD
Yeah.
JANE
Maybe I lost some respect for my dad.
ERHARD
I’m going to tell you a story and I want you to look inside the story and see what’s there for you.
Children have a bond of belonging and sometimes that gets broken. There’s this bond between
your parents and you, and then it gets broken. Did that happen for you?
JANE
I don’t think so.
ERHARD
Did it happen back then?
JANE
I don’t know.
ERHARD
Did you have a bond with your dad?
JANE
Yeah and she broke it.
Forum Day Two: Session Three
163
ERHARD
Okay that’s what happened and that’s what you’re sad about. You had a bond with your father,
and just her presence broke that bond. What did you decide?
JANE
That I had to break the bond between them, her and me? Tell her how I feel. And tell her how I
felt that she came.
ERHARD
That’s not a strange way for a little girl to feel, now is it?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
But for a mature woman, that’s clearly not what happened, is it?
JANE
I don’t understand.
ERHARD
Looking from your point of view now, did your father’s marriage break the bond between you
and your dad?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
Can you get off  it with your stepmom about breaking the bond between you and your dad?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
So maybe you could say to your stepmom that when I was a little girl, I didn’t even realize it un-
til I saw it today, but there’s been something in the relationship between you and I. “When I was
a little girl and you came into my life, it felt like you had broken my bond with my father, but
now I see that that isn’t true. So that’s not between you and me any more. I can be fully related
to you.” How does that feel?
JANE
But I’m still sad. I don’t know what it’s about.
164
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Whatever that’s about will come up before we’re through. You know you’ve got to be a big per-
son to have the kind of conversation we just had?
Erhard had been very gentle during this entire interaction, standing very close to Jane. Kipp then
proceeded to do the seminar program enrollment.
ERHARD (to the group)
For the dinner break there are two assignments. Observe and inquire into the real nature of
your relating to other people. What’s really going on with you when you’re relating to other
people? As you’re being with people, what’s really going on with you? And two, after dinner, I
invite you to have a conversation about the seminar program.
The Forum adjourned for a dinner break.
166
SPEAKING BEING
FORUM DAY TWO: SESSION FOUR
The Forum resumed at 9:10 pm, following the dinner break. Kipp was on the
platform with Erhard, and asked for questions in response to the break assignment
to have a conversation about the seminar program. After Kipp fi elded these ques-
tions, Erhard came forward.
ERHARD
I know it’s possible to turn this into another thing you’ve done in your life.
In independent surveys, most people say it was the most, or a very, signifi -
cant experience in their life. The way you determine what’s possible is by the
conversation that you are. This was not designed as another seminar. This was
not designed to help you get better. This was not designed to improve you. We
could have done that with a lot less time and eff ort. You want to be here for
something extraordinary. You want to be here for the possibility that this could
make the diff erence in your life. This was designed to make the diff erence in
your life. Now with regard to this seminar business: See, I don’t like this con-
versation. What is so strange about doing something about who you are reg-
ularly? I go to the dentist regularly, do something for my teeth regularly. This
is extraordinary stuff . If what happened in this room before the break didn’t
move you, didn’t touch you... if that didn’t turn you on, this is not a great thing
for you to do. But if this speaks to you, this is a very appropriate place for you.
So we’re going to talk to you about the seminar program. You have the power
to decline. This is a very easy conversation to pay attention to if you’re clear
about the fact that you’ve got the power to decline.
During this conversation Erhard came down from the platform and moved around
among the group.
(continuing)
How many of you have had some major impact in your life out of the two days
so far?
A majority of the participants stood.
(continuing)
This is a part of The Forum. You know that form you fi lled out this morning?
That’s a part of The Forum.
(indicating Kipp)
He’s not like you. He’s not hanging out. Kipp is up to something. It looks
like we’re doing one Forum. We’re really doing fi ve hundred diff erent Fo-
rums because each person brings something diff erent to it. You don’t know
what you are. You only know what you were. If you give yourself a future
based on what you were, that’s not very powerful, is it?  We want to give you
the power to create a future not given to you by the past.
PARTICIPANT
Isn’t that artifi cial?
ERHARD
Yes, in a certain sense it’s artifi cial, in that you can’t predict it. But in a certain
sense isn’t everything that’s created artifi cial? I have a little rule in my relation-
ships. Don’t ever do anything you don’t want to do. I’ve got another rule: ride
the horse in the direction it’s going. They’re the same rule.
(loudly)
Because nobody ever does anything they don’t want to do... “I don’t want to be
here” is a racket. Did you ever see Karate Kid?  That was coaching. That’s what
?
happens in seminars.
At this point Wes moved forward on the platform. Erhard remained in the room,
strolling around in the aisles.
WES
We’re going to take a deeper look at the distinction racket. You have to be lis-
tening from the question, what is the distinction racket and what is my racket?
Try on the possibility that your racket is both something put out there and
something covering up.
ERHARD
You don’t need to see what happened... Here’s all that’s important: my racket
is, the payoff  is, the cost is. Wes is going through the other stuff  with people
so you can see more of the racket that underlies that. But you don’t gotta get
what happened in order to gain some freedom from your racket.
(pausing
(
)
Lots of people are trying to get better. And it’s a racket. If you’re trying to get
better, it’s all right if you don’t produce results. There are certain relationships
between payoff s and costs. Avoiding responsibility and stifl ed self-expression
are almost invariably related.
WES
Selfi sh lives in your mouth. Or, more rigorously, in your conversation... Selfi sh
is in your listening... That’s the location of your racket. Your racket is a conver-
sation. The point of the conversation is on the board (i.e., racket payoff s). It’s

er. And there’s no hope. Nothing in life is so good as being right. As a matter of
fact, people will give up their whole lives to be right. How many people on the
dinner break called and reached someone in your life and got complete?
About one hundred people raised their hands.
As the second day of The Forum neared its end, assistants distributed homework
assignments to the participants.
WES
Here’s your assignment for this evening. First, consider inquiring into what’s
driving your relationship with other people.  Second, write a letter to some-
one you know.  Here’s the form: I came to The Forum to accomplish...; what I
actually am accomplishing is; I plan to use The Forum in... Twenty-fi ve people
were late this morning.  Cut the crap.

for its own why. The question “Why the Why?” looks externally
and at first like a frivolous repetition of the same interroga-
tive, which can go on forever; it looks like an eccentric and
empty rumination about insubstantial meanings of words.
Certainly that is how it looks. The only question is whether we
are willing to fall victim to this cheap look of things and thus
take the whole matter as settled or whether we are capable
of experiencing a provocative happening in this recoil of the
why-question back upon itself. (IM 6)
M
END OF DAY TWO INTERVAL
The Forgetting of Being, Part Two of Eight:  Questioning
The Forum is an inquiry. It is a process of asking questions, not providing informa-
tion. The value of the process arises in the questioning itself. This is questioning of a
radically diff erent nature than we are accustomed to. “To pronounce the interroga-
tive sentence, even in a questioning tone, is not yet to question,” says Heidegger; he
continues:
“
If I say to you “Why are there beings at all instead of nothing?”
then the intent of my asking and saying is not to communicate
to you that a process of questioning is now going on inside me.
Certainly the spoken interrogative sentence can also be taken
this way, but then one is precisely not hearing the question-
ing. The questioning does not result in any shared question-
ing and self-questioning. It awakens nothing in the way of a
questioning attitude, or even a questioning disposition. For
this consists in a willing to know. . . . Questioning is willing-to-
know. (IM 23)
M
In this passage Heidegger distinguishes a questioning state of mind, a standing-
in-the-question that at the same time wills itself forward into the opening of the
question—a dialogic engagement in the questioning process, a listening which par-
ticipates in the questioning advance along with the questioner. This possibility of the
listener’s thinking-Being along with the questioner will be seen to be an important
element of The Forum.
Despite the fact that the question of Being never elicits an answer, the question-
ing itself—“a distinctive occurrence that we call a happening” (IM 6)—is a transforma-
tive experience. This is because “the question of Being must be asked of Being about
Being from within Being” (BT 24), and therefore is in its essence reflexive:
T
“
The why-question challenges beings as a whole, so to speak,
outstrips them, though never completely. But this is precisely
how the question gains its distinction. What is asked in the
question rebounds upon the questioning itself, for the ques-
tioning challenges beings as a whole, but does not aft er all
wrest itself free from them. . . . It runs up against the search
A body of scholarship has noted the aff inities between the thinking of Heidegger
and that of Zen (e.g., Steff ney (1977), Kotoh (1987) and Storey (2012)). Heidegger’s
attention here to the possibilities of an apparently tautological question recalls the
use in Rinzai Zen of seemingly nonsensical koans (What is the sound of the one hand
clapping?) to eff ect a transformation in thinking.
But the locus of the transformation is not the thinking of the questioners; nor
are the circumstances themselves altered. Rather, in the questioning itself, every
secure foothold is lost (IM 32). In that moment, the possibility of new understand-
ings emerges.
This power of the question of Being to undermine foundations is central to the
process of The Forum. Erhard’s ontological inquiry is constructed upon two funda-
mental questions: What is the Being of human beings? and What is the possibility of
Being for human beings? The first question undermines the foundation; the second
?
moves toward the creation of new understandings. Both are essential and distinct
elements of the same questioning movement. It is this modulation of questionable-
ness into possibility that Heidegger addresses here:
“
Our questioning just opens up the domain so that beings
can break open in such questionworthiness. . . . Yet, it is this
questioning that pushes us into the open, provided that it it-
self, as a questioning, transforms itself (as does every genuine
questioning), and casts a new space over and through every-
thing. (IM 33)
M
The situation is not changed through questioning; its possibility is transformed.
But questioning, according to translator J. Glenn Gray, was not for Heidegger a
codified procedure:
Forum Day Two: End of Day Two Interval
169
“
Putting in question is not primarily a method for him as it was
for Descartes and for his teacher Husserl. At least it is not a
method in the sense that one uses it as a preliminary to build-
ing up a body of doctrine aft er tearing down earlier systems.
No, for Heidegger questioning is a way or path of thinking
which each one must clear for himself with no certain desti-
nation in mind. (WCT xiii)
T
The seeking of answers is so basic to the scholarly calling that conceiving such a
questioning attitude is problematic, and maintaining that attitude more so:
“
Being able to question means being able to wait, even for a
lifetime. But an age for which the actual is only whatever goes
fast and can be grasped with both hands takes questioning as
a “stranger to reality,” as something that does not count as
profitable. But what is essential is not counting but the right
time—that is, the right moment and the right endurance.
For the mindful god
Does detest
Untimely growth.

ما اکنون در گروه جایزه هستیم. این فراتر از انجمن است. به رابطه خود با
والدین شما از این سؤال: "آیا آنها واقعاً با من درست هستند؟" چه چیزی برای پیاده شدن باید
با آنها؟ کامل بودن هرگز کسی را با چیزی که روی آنها ریخته است ، نمی گذارد. از Din- استفاده کنید
Ner Break برای تکمیل با والدین خود. یک تلفن پیدا کنید به آنها برسید. اگر والدین شما نیستند
زنده ، کسی را که با آنها ناقص و کامل است ، کنید. آیا کسی نامشخص است؟ در حالی که ارهارد به اتاق بازگشت ، جین ، یک شرکت کننده نوجوان ، رز و صحبت کرد ، شیوه او بسیار خجالتی است

جین
من در مورد کامل بودن با والدین شما نمی فهمم. وهمی
آیا والدین شما به همان شکلی که هستند با شما درست هستند؟ جین
بله وهمی
بنابراین مشکل چیست؟ erhard (به آرامی)
جین ، در مورد والدین خود چیزی با شما اتفاق می افتد ، آیا آنجا نیست؟ جین (بسیار آزمایشی)
من نمی دانم درز
آیا احساس می کند وجود دارد؟ جین
بله درز
پس چه خبر است؟ جین
من نمی دانم چیزی از گذشته؟ درز
آیا چیزی وجود دارد که احساس بدی برای شما دارد؟ جین
بله درز
چیه؟ جین
تنها چیزی که می توانم به آن فکر کنم ، نامادری من است ، راهی که آنها او را به زندگی من آوردند. پریشانی
پرتاب یک اصطلاح اصلی هایدگریایی است که ورنر ارهارد از آن استفاده می کند
به طور گسترده در پاسخ به اولین سؤال از انجمن: چه
وجود انسان است؟ در وجود و زمان ، پرتاب یک جنبه اساسی از
وجود Dasein ؛ Erhard آن را "پاکسازی پیش فرض" برای انسان می نامد
موجودات (یادداشت های نویسنده ، معرفی 6 روزه LA 1989). "در پرتاب" ، "
هایدگر می گوید: "مشخص شده است که در هر مورد dasein ، مانند من
Dasein و این Dasein ، در حال حاضر در دنیای مشخص و در کنار آن قرار دارد
طیف مشخصی از موجودات مشخص در درون جهان "(BT 264
حرف
). پرتاب گزینه های Dasein در زندگی را تعیین می کند ، و هیچ وجود ندارد
دیگران: "به عنوان چیزی که پرتاب می شود ، داسین به صورت گسترده پرتاب شده است
تنیس این به عنوان موجودی وجود دارد که باید همانطور که هست و همانطور که می تواند باشد "
(BT 321
حرف
) ، و علاوه بر این ، "آن را به" آنجا "آورده است ، اما نه
به توافق خودش "(BT 329
حرف
). کلمه "پرتاب" روشی را که ما زخمی می کنیم بیان می کند
بودن ، روشی که ما خودمان را همیشه در حال حاضر می دانیم: پرتاب
تعیین می کند که ما به طور خودکار چیست و آینده ما را محدود می کند
امکانات (آنچه ما "می توانیم"). این پاکسازی هستی شناختی است که
در زمان ما ارسال شده است. "ما فقط این امکان را داریم که
ارهارد می گوید: "ما به ارث بردیم ،" احتمال اینکه ما در آن بودیم
پرتاب شده - ما به این روش خاص پرتاب شده ایم ، ما به آن پرتاب می شویم
این نوع موجودی که این مجموعه خاص از گزینه ها را دارد "("
قلب موضوع "). هایدگر می گوید که این گزینه ها حقایق وحشیانه عینی نیستند
در مورد محیطی که در آن پرتاب می شویم ؛ این خواهد بود
واقعیت بودن اوضاع ، و اگر ما ممکن است این واقعیت ها را کشف کنیم
حرف
به دنبال آنها بود اما پرتاب Dasein "به معنای پیشنهاد این است
واقعیت تحویل آن "(Bt 174). ما در واقعیت زندگی می کنیم ،
حرف
راه ما
حرف
وجود دارد ، و نه واقعیت ؛ ما خام را نمی بینیم
داده های محیط زیست ، ما داستانی در مورد جهان می بینیم. این ماست
حرف
واقعیت: این که ما پرتاب شده ایم ، و این که پرتاب ما بازدارنده نیست
استخراج شده توسط چیزها یا شرایط "در آنجا". بلکه این است
Acteristic از روش Dasein در جهان. داسین زخم دارد
به هر شکلی که وجود داشته باشد ، و برای ادامه دادن خود ، داسین
باید از داشتن هزینه خود برای توجیه این روش پرتاب خودداری کند
از وجود از دیدگاه راه ما
حرف
زخمی شدن بودن ، پس

درز
بنابراین بیایید در مورد آن کمی صحبت کنیم. چه اتفاقی افتاد؟ جین
پدرم با او به خانه آمد. او مدتی از بین رفت و گفت: "این مادر شما است." این است بدون سوال درز
و به خودتان چه گفتید؟ جین
خوب درز
شما؟ آیا آن را پر کردید؟ جین
خوب من فکر کردم که شاید او او را وارد کند تا من یک مادر داشته باشم ، زیرا پدر و مادرم گرفتند
طلاق ، و سپس دو ماه بعد مادر واقعی من درگذشت. و احساس می کنم او او را به من آورد
زندگی درز
همان چیزی است که شما نسبت به آن احساس بدی دارید ... جین
اما مادرم مرا دوست دارد. من از نیمی از کارهایی که او انجام می دهد خوشحالم. اما در آن زمان که فکر کردم ، "او است
چنین عوضی ، چرا او این کار را می کند؟ " و من می خواستم فقط فرار کنم.
و این که او سعی در جایگزینی مادر واقعی من نداشت. درز
خوب این بدان معنا نیست که مادر شما عجیب نیست. از آنجا که همه ما عجیب هستیم ، درست است ، شما دیده اید
که در اینجا اما مادر شما شما را دوست دارد ، و او عجیب است. با مادر خود ، باید چنین باشد
او درست مثل خودش است. من نگفتم که او درست است که همانطور که هست باشد. مادرم این کار را نکرد
کارهای احمقانه ای که او با من انجام داد زیرا او مرا دوست داشت. او کارهای احمقانه ای را که با او انجام داد انجام داد
من چون او احمق بود. و او مرا دوست داشت. این طور نیست که او درست بود. بنابراین شما کمی دارید
کمی در آنجا در مورد درست کردن مادرتان برای روشی که او است ، همه شما. بنابراین ، بهتر است
احساس این غم چیست؟ آیا این مربوط به طلاق مادر و پدر شما است؟ جین
من این را به یاد نمی آورم درز
آیا این مربوط به مرگ مادرتان است؟ تحقیق هستی شناختی - نوع صحبت کردن که باعث می شود - اتفاق می افتد
به عنوان چیزی که باید از آن دور شود ، سعی کنید جهش کنید. در واقع ، هایدگر در مورد مرکزیت ما تأکید می کند
واقعیت در تعیین وجود ما. روحیه ما ، مدرن
ذهن ، راهی که ما دنیای خود را درک می کنیم- از پدیده
چشم انداز منطقی - واقعیت ها هستند: "[m] ood dasein را به ارمغان می آورد
قبل از "این" از "آنجا" است ، که به همین ترتیب ، آن را خیره می کند
چهره با عدم توانایی یک مبهم. " حتی اگر داسین
در تلاش برای "روشنگری منطقی" ، سعی می کند یک ایستاده جدا شده
نکته ، و به خود می گوید ، واقعاً ، این فقط یک روحیه است - "همه اینها
شمارش هیچ چیز در برابر حقایق پدیده این پرونده "
(BT 175
حرف
). هوبرت دریفوس ، در خواندن وجود و زمان ، انتخاب می کند
ترجمه Heidegger's Befindlichkeit به عنوان محبت به جای دولت-
حرف
از ذهن او احساس می کند که عبارت دوم یک ذهنی خصوصی را پیشنهاد می کند
وضعیت ذهنی ، هنگامی که هایدگر در حال تشخیص است Dasein's است
"در شرایطی پیدا می شود که چیزها و گزینه ها از قبل اهمیت دارند"
(بودن در جهان 168). این یک نکته مهم است. در پرتاب ما-
د
ness ، همه چیز مانند گذشته و همیشه معنی دار با آنها روبرو می شوند:
اجازه دادن به چیزی در درجه اول است
دور این فقط احساس نمی کند
چیز ، یا خیره به آن. این به معنای دور است-
دغد
به نوعی در ارتباط قرار گرفت. بشر بشر بشر بودن به این ترتیب
از قبل وجود دارد
به گونه ای که آنچه با آن روبرو می شود
در درون جهان می تواند در این مورد "مهم" باشد
راه (bt 176)
"
نکته هایدگر این است که روحیه ما ، مانند حالت های ذهن ما ، هستند
نه پدیده های ذهنی ذهنی که در یک دکارتی یافت می شود
الگوی انسان. برای هایدگر ، حال و هوای "هیچ یک از آنها به وجود نمی آید
از "خارج" یا "داخل" ، اما ناشی از بودن در جهان است ،
به عنوان راهی برای چنین موجودی »(Bt 176
حرف
). شیوه پرتلاش ما راهی نیست که بتوانیم بسازیم
صریح یا نظریه پردازی. این مبتنی بر اعتقادات و انسان نیست

جین
من آن را به یاد می آورم ، اما به یاد می آورم که بیشتر نامادرم وارد زندگی ام شد. و مادرم در حال مرگ است. درز
آیا مادر واقعی خود را دوست داشتی؟ جین
من واقعاً به یاد نمی آورم فکر کردم انجام دادم من او را به یاد نمی آورم. درز
بنابراین آیا چیزی با مادر واقعی شما ناقص است؟ جین
شماره erhard
شما با او خوب هستید؟ جین
بله درز
پدرت؟ جین
من با او کامل هستم درز
نامادری شما؟ جین
بله درز
شما متوجه "نه" تقریبا احمقانه می شوید؟ او لازم نیست آنجا احمق باشد. نه "من حدس می زنم." و این
از ابتدا به دلیل اینکه او فقط نشان داد و شما فرصتی برای ایجاد یک رابطه ندارید-
کشتی مثل اینجا مادر شما است. آیا از آن زمان رابطه برقرار کرده اید؟ جین
بله موجودات ، در بیشتر موارد ، اقدامات روزمره ما را نشان نمی دهند
به تجزیه و تحلیل ما به سادگی درگیر شیوه های ارث می شویم
سنت ها ، سنتی که در آن پرتاب شده ایم. اما
درک ما از خودمان سطحی باقی مانده است: "
البته ، Dasein نه تنها به ما نزدیک است - حتی آنچه
نزدیکترین است ما آن هستیم ، هر یک از ما ، خودمان هستیم. علی رغم این ،
یا به اصطلاح فقط به همین دلیل ، از نظر هستی شناختی است
دورترین "(Bt 36
حرف
). Dreyfus نمونه هایی از نحوه وراثت ما را پیشنهاد کرده است
عناصر این پرتاب. یک مادر ژاپنی او را راحت می کند
کودک به شیوه فرهنگ خود ، به روش های ساکت و تسکین دهنده ،
در حالی که همتای آمریکایی او کودک خود را بیشتر تحریک می کند
رفتارهای فعال و صوتی. این انتخاب های والدین به طور کلی است
بخشی ، ناخودآگاه از طرف مادران ؛ آنها به سادگی هستند
بازتولید شیوه های موجود در فرهنگ آنها. با این حال ، توسط
زمانی که نوزادان سه تا چهار ماه سن دارند ، آنها دارند
قبلاً یاد گرفته است که نوزادان ژاپنی و آمریکایی هستند (در بودن
جهان 17). در مثال دیگر ، Dreyfus پیشنهاد می کند که همه
د
قوانین ضمنی اما مهم حاکم بر رفتارهای غیر کلامی ،
که در بین فرهنگ ها بسیار متفاوت است - از جنبه های پروکسمی
به عنوان فاصله مناسب برای ایستادن از دیگران ، نسبی
مطلوبیت تماس مستقیم چشمی یا انتظارات موقعیتی
با توجه به لمس - با مشاهده ناخودآگاه مانند ما آموخته می شود
بالغ در یک فرهنگ (بودن در جهان 18). این قوانین
مدتها قبل از اینکه صریحاً در مورد آنها تأمل کنیم ، تلقین شوید ،
و تا آن زمان ، وجود روزمره Dasein از قبل تعیین شده است
به طور واقعی ، همراه با روحیه های اجتماعی که گزینه های ما را شکل می دهد
برای بودن با دیگران در جهان. در اینجا مهم است که توجه داشته باشید که پرتاب ، مانند دیگری
ایده هایی که توسط هایدگر برای تمایز وجود داسین معرفی شده است ،
نباید به عنوان یک حالت منفی وجود تعبیر شود. با توجه به آن
محدودیت های ظاهری ، این خلاف واقع و چالش برانگیز است
ما فکر می کنیم اما چنین زبان های متناقض برای زیر
ایستاده اند فکر هایدگر و ارهارد. منفی
شرایط به طور طبیعی منجر به انگیزه انسان می شود ... آنها را "برطرف" ،
اما هم هایدگر و هم ورنر ارهارد پیشنهاد غیرقانونی تر

من نمی دانم من با او رابطه دارم. اما من نمی دانم چه چیزی ناقص است. درز
چند سال داشتید که او مادر شما شد؟ جین
چهار ، یا فی ، یا شش. درز
آیا آنجا چیزی را از دست دادید؟ جین
وقتی بچه بودم برگشتم؟ درز
بله جین
شاید من احترام به پدرم از دست داده ام. درز
من می خواهم یک داستان را برای شما تعریف کنم و می خواهم شما به درون داستان نگاه کنید و ببینید چه چیزی برای شما وجود دارد. کودکان پیوند متعلق دارند و گاهی اوقات شکسته می شود. این پیوند بین
والدین و شما ، و سپس شکسته می شود. آیا این برای شما اتفاق افتاده است؟ جین
من فکر نمی کنم درز
آیا در آن زمان اتفاق افتاد؟ جین
من نمی دانم درز
آیا با پدرتان پیوند داشتید؟ جین
بله و او آن را شکست. روز اول انجمن: جلسه سوم

درز
خوب این اتفاقی است که افتاد و این همان چیزی است که شما از آن ناراحت هستید. شما با پدر خود پیوند داشتید ،
و فقط حضور او این پیوند را شکست. چه چیزی تصمیم گرفتید؟ جین
که من مجبور شدم پیوند بین آنها ، او و من را بشکنم؟ به او بگویید چه احساسی دارم. و به او بگویید چگونه من
احساس کرد که او آمده است. درز
این یک روش عجیب برای یک دختر کوچک نیست ، اکنون اینطور است؟ جین
شماره erhard
اما برای یک زن بالغ ، این به وضوح چه اتفاقی افتاده است ، این است؟ جین

از نظر شما اکنون با نگاهی به ازدواج پدرتان ، پیوند بین شما را شکست
و پدرت؟ جین
شماره erhard
آیا می توانید با نامادری خود در مورد شکستن پیوند بین شما و پدرتان از آن خارج شوید؟ جین
بله درز
بنابراین شاید شما می توانید به نامادری خود بگویید که وقتی من یک دختر کوچک بودم ، حتی آن را درک نکردم
تا امروز من آن را دیدم ، اما چیزی در رابطه بین شما و من وجود داشته است. "وقتی من بودم
یک دختر کوچک و شما به زندگی من رسیدید ، احساس می کنید پیوند من را با پدرم شکسته اید ، اما
اکنون می بینم که این درست نیست. بنابراین این بین شما و من دیگر نیست. من می توانم کاملاً مرتبط باشم
به شما. " این چه احساسی دارد؟

هرچه درباره آن باشد ، قبل از اینکه ما از بین برویم. شما می دانید که باید یک فرد بزرگ باشید
پسر برای داشتن نوع مکالمه ای که ما فقط داشتیم؟ ارهارد در کل این تعامل بسیار ملایم بود و بسیار نزدیک جین ایستاده بود. کیپ سپس
اقدام به انجام ثبت نام برنامه سمینار کرد. erhard (به گروه)
برای تعطیلات شام دو تکلیف وجود دارد. از ماهیت واقعی رعایت و سؤال کنید
مربوط به افراد دیگر وقتی با دیگران ارتباط دارید واقعاً با شما اتفاق می افتد
مردم؟ همانطور که با مردم هستید ، واقعاً با شما چه می گذرد؟ و دو ، بعد از شام ، من
از شما دعوت کنید تا در مورد برنامه سمینار مکالمه کنید. این انجمن برای استراحت شام به تعویق افتاد. 166

روز انجمن دو: جلسه چهارم
این مجمع در ساعت 9:10 بعد از ظهر به دنبال استراحت شام از سر گرفته شد. کیپ در
سکو با Erhard ، و در پاسخ به تکلیف استراحت سؤال کرد
برای گفتگو در مورد برنامه سمینار. بعد از اینکه کیپ از این سؤال پیروز شد-
ارهارد جلو آمد. درز
من می دانم که می توان این کار را به کار دیگری که در زندگی خود انجام داده اید تبدیل کنید. در نظرسنجی های مستقل ، اکثر مردم می گویند که این بیشترین یا بسیار مهم بوده است -
نمی توان در زندگی آنها تجربه کرد. نحوه تعیین آنچه ممکن است توسط
مکالمه ای که شما هستید این به عنوان سمینار دیگر طراحی نشده است. این بود
طراحی نشده است تا به شما در بهتر شدن کمک کند. این برای بهبود شما طراحی نشده است. ما
می توانست این کار را با زمان بسیار کمتری انجام دهد و کار کند. شما می خواهید اینجا باشید
چیزی خارق العاده شما می خواهید در اینجا باشید تا این امکان وجود داشته باشد
تفاوت در زندگی خود را ایجاد کنید. این برای ایجاد تفاوت در آن طراحی شده است
زندگی شما اکنون با توجه به این تجارت سمینار: ببینید ، من این را دوست ندارم
بیان چه چیزی در مورد انجام کاری در مورد اینکه شما چه کسی هستید بسیار عجیب است-
ularly؟ من به طور مرتب به دندانپزشک می روم ، مرتباً برای دندانهایم کاری انجام می دهم. این
چیزهای خارق العاده ای است اگر چه اتفاقی در این اتاق قبل از استراحت افتاد
شما را حرکت دهید ، شما را لمس نکنید ... اگر این کار شما را روشن نکرد ، این یک چیز عالی نیست
برای اینکه شما انجام دهید اما اگر این با شما صحبت کند ، این مکان بسیار مناسبی برای شماست. بنابراین ما قصد داریم در مورد برنامه سمینار با شما صحبت کنیم. شما قدرت دارید
کاهش اگر روشن باشید ، این یک مکالمه بسیار آسان است که باید به آن توجه کنید
در مورد این واقعیت که شما قدرت کاهش را دارید. در طول این گفتگو ، Erhard از سکو پایین آمد و به اطراف حرکت کرد
در میان گروه (ادامه)
چه تعداد از شما از دو روز تأثیر عمده ای در زندگی خود داشته اید
اینقدر دور؟ اکثر شرکت کنندگان ایستادند. (ادامه)
این بخشی از انجمن است. شما می دانید که این فرم امروز صبح از بین رفته اید؟ این بخشی از انجمن است. (نشانگر KIPP)
او مثل شما نیست. او آویزان نیست. کیپ به چیزی بستگی دارد. به نظر می رسد
مثل اینکه ما در حال انجام یک انجمن هستیم. ما واقعاً در حال انجام صدها متفاوتی هستیم
شکمبه زیرا هر شخص چیزی را با آن به ارمغان می آورد. شما نمی دانید
آنچه هستی شما فقط می دانید که چه چیزی بودید. اگر آینده ای به خودتان بدهید
براساس آنچه شما بودید ، این خیلی قدرتمند نیست ، اینطور است؟ ما می خواهیم به شما بدهیم
قدرت ایجاد آینده ای که توسط گذشته به شما داده نشده است. شرکت کننده
آیا این مصنوعی نیست؟ درز
بله ، به معنای خاص ، این مصنوعی است ، به این دلیل که نمی توانید آن را پیش بینی کنید. اما در یک خاص
حس نیست که همه چیزهایی که آثار هنری ایجاد شده اند؟ من در رابطه خود کمی قاعده دارم-
کشتی ها هرگز کاری نکنید که نمی خواهید انجام دهید. من یک قانون دیگر دارم: سوار شوید

قدم زدن در راهروها. وهمی
ما می خواهیم نگاهی عمیق تر به راکت تمایز بیندازیم. شما باید لیس باشید-
از این سوال ، راکت تمایز چیست و راکت من چیست؟ این احتمال را امتحان کنید که راکت شما هم چیزی باشد که در آنجا قرار داده شده است و
چیزی که پوشش می دهد درز
لازم نیست ببینید چه اتفاقی افتاده است ... این همه مهم است: راکت من
بازپرداخت است ، هزینه است. وس با افراد دیگر چیزهای دیگر را پشت سر می گذارد

به خودی خود چرا سوال "چرا چرا؟" خارجی به نظر می رسد
و در ابتدا مانند تکرار بی پروا از همان بازجویی-
Tive ، که می تواند برای همیشه ادامه یابد. به نظر می رسد مانند یک مرکز و
شایعات خالی در مورد معانی غیرقانونی کلمات. مطمئناً اینگونه به نظر می رسد. تنها سوال این است که آیا ما
مایل به قربانی این نگاه ارزان از چیزها هستند و به این ترتیب
کل موضوع را در صورت تسویه حساب کنید یا اینکه ما قادر هستیم
تجربه یک اتفاق تحریک آمیز در این برگه
چرا-پرسش به خود بازگشت. (من 6)

پایان روز دو فاصله
فراموشی بودن بودن ، قسمت دوم از هشت: سؤال
انجمن یک تحقیق است. این یک روند پرسیدن سؤال است ، بدون ارائه اطلاعات
tion ارزش فرآیند در خود سؤال بوجود می آید. این سوال از a است
طبیعت کاملاً متفاوت از آنچه که به آن عادت کرده ایم متفاوت است. "برای تلفظ Interroga-
جمله ، حتی با لحنی سؤال برانگیز ، هنوز سؤال نشده است. "
ادامه:
"
اگر به شما بگویم "چرا به جای هیچ چیز اصلاً موجوداتی وجود دارند؟"
سپس هدف پرسیدن و گفتن من برقراری ارتباط نیست
برای شما که فرآیند سؤال در حال حاضر در درون من ادامه دارد. مطمئناً جمله بازجویی گفتاری نیز می تواند گرفته شود
به این ترتیب ، اما پس از آن یکی دقیقاً سوال را نمی شنود-
در سؤال در مورد سؤال مشترک نیست-
ing و خودکشی. این هیچ چیز در راه a بیدار نمی شود
نگرش سؤال ، یا حتی یک مورد سؤال. برای
این شامل تمایل به دانستن است. بشر بشر بشر سؤال کردن مایل است
می دانید (من 23)
مگس
در این قسمت هایدگر یک حالت سؤال برانگیز ، یک ایستاده را متمایز می کند
در این سؤال که در عین حال خود را به سمت باز شدن می خواهد
سوال- تعامل دیالوگ در فرآیند سؤال ، گوش دادن به آن
در پیشبرد سؤال همراه با پرسشگر. این احتمال از
تفکر شنونده همراه با سؤال کننده مهم خواهد بود
عنصر انجمن. با وجود این واقعیت که سوال این که هرگز پاسخی را ایجاد نمی کند ، سوال-
خود- "یک اتفاق متمایز که ما آن را یک اتفاق می نامیم" (IM 6)- یک تبدیل-
تجربه tive این امر به این دلیل است که "باید از این سؤال پرسید که وجود دارد
بودن از درون بودن "(BT 24) ، و بنابراین در ذات آن بازتابنده است:
حرف
"
چرا که به طور کلی موجودات را به چالش می کشد ، به اصطلاح ،
از آنها پیشی می گیرد ، هر چند هرگز کاملاً. اما این دقیقاً است
چگونه این سؤال تمایز خود را به دست می آورد. آنچه در
سوال بر روی سوال خود ، برای سؤال برگشت-
به طور کلی موجودات را به چالش می کشد ، اما همه را به وجود نمی آورد
خود را عاری از آنها. بشر بشر بشر در مقابل جستجو اجرا می شود
بدنه بورس تحصیلی ، توجه بین تفکر هایدگر را ذکر کرده است
و آن از ذن (به عنوان مثال ، استف نای (1977) ، کوتو (1987) و استوایی (2012)). هایدگر
توجه در اینجا به امکانات یک سوال ظاهراً محکم به یاد می آورد
استفاده در Rinzai Zen از Koans به ظاهر مزخرف (صدای یک طرف چیست
کف زدن؟) برای تحول در تفکر. اما محل تحول ، تفکر پرسشنامه ها نیست. نه
آیا شرایط خود تغییر کرده اند. در عوض ، در زیر سؤال ، همه
جایگاه امن از بین رفته است (IM 32). در آن لحظه ، امکان درک جدید-
ings ظهور می کند. این قدرت سوال از بودن برای تضعیف بنیادها برای این امر اساسی است
روند انجمن. تحقیق هستی شناختی Erhard بر روی دو سرمایه ساخته شده است
سوالات ذهنی: وجود انسان چیست؟ و احتمال وجود دارد
بودن برای انسان؟ اولین سوال بنیاد را تضعیف می کند. دوم
؟ به سمت ایجاد درک های جدید حرکت می کند. هر دو ضروری و متمایز هستند
عناصر همان جنبش سؤال کننده. این این مدولاسیون سوال برانگیز است-
به این امکان که هایدگر در اینجا آدرس می دهد:
"
سؤال ما فقط دامنه را باز می کند تا موجودات
می تواند در چنین سؤال از بین برود. بشر بشر بشر با این حال ، این است
سؤال از این مسئله که ما را به سمت فضای باز سوق می دهد ، به شرط آنکه
خود ، به عنوان یک سؤال ، خود را تغییر می دهد (مانند همه واقعی
سؤال) ، و فضای جدیدی را از طریق همه و از طریق
چیز (IM 33)
مگس
اوضاع از طریق سؤال تغییر نمی کند. احتمال آن دگرگون شده است. اما سؤال ، به گفته مترجم جی. گلن گری ، برای هایدگر نبود
رویه رمزگذاری شده:
روز دوم انجمن: پایان روز دو فاصله
169
"
سؤال کردن در درجه اول روشی برای او نیست
برای دکارت و برای معلمش هوسرل. حداقل این نیست
روش به این معنا که فرد از آن به عنوان اولیه برای ساخت استفاده می کند-
ایجاد یک بدن از آموزه ها که سیستم های قبلی را پاره می کند. نه ، زیرا سؤال هایدگر راهی یا مسیر تفکر است
که هرکدام باید خود را بدون هیچ مقصدی پاک کنند-
ملت در ذهن (wct xiii)
حرف
جستجوی پاسخ ها برای فراخوان علمی بسیار اساسی است که تصور چنین چیزی
نگرش سؤال کننده مشکل ساز و حفظ آن نگرش بیشتر است:
"
توانایی سؤال کردن به معنای توانایی صبر کردن ، حتی برای
طول عمر اما سنی که واقعی برای آن فقط هر آنچه پیش می رود
سریع و با هر دو دست می توان از آن استفاده کرد
"غریبه واقعیت" ، به عنوان چیزی که به حساب نمی آید
سودآور اما آنچه ضروری است شمارش نیست بلکه حق است
زمان - یعنی لحظه مناسب و استقامت مناسب. برای خدای ذهن آگاه
آیا نفرت می کند
رشد به موقع - هاولدرلین ، قطعه ای از دوره "تایتان ها" (IV ، 218). حرفهای
