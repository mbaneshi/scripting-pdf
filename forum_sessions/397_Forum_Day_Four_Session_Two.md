Forum Day Four: Session Two

to that was: “Oh we have to do this again? I have to go back to when I was six-years-old?” But it
didn’t take very long for me to see that that’s where I was, for a long time. And I always have a
reason for why I’m not there. But I really am there. So it goes back to an incident that happened,
not when I was six, but when I was like twelve or thirteen, and I just wasn’t there for my sister. I
just wasn’t there and I had wonderful reasons for it. The best reasons. I was always the best kid,
the best sister; so I never got anything for it: I just wasn’t there.
KIPP
You lived inside a story called “I’m the best kid,” which gave you a justifi cation for anything that
happened that was inconsistent with that.
ANABETH
Right. So yesterday, I called my son, who is twenty-one. I have four children, but he’s the only
one I called because I got that he could listen to it, because he’s had an experience somewhat
like The Forum.
KIPP
This is another reason by the way. More crap, right?
ANABETH
The reason I called Johnny?
KIPP
“Well, you know Johnny, he’s like that.”
ANABETH
No, no, no. That’s not it.
KIPP
Okay.
ANABETH
I called Johnny because I wanted to tell him that I was proud of him. And when I couldn’t reach
him, I thought well, “I’ll call one of my other kids.”
KIPP
Is it true that you couldn’t reach him or that you didn’t reach him?
ANABETH
I did not reach him. He was not on the other end of the phone call. He was out. So I called another
number where he was supposed to be, and he was out at that number too. So I just kept calling
all day long until I fi nally got him woken up to come to the phone. I called him: I could tell him
how proud I was of him, and for calling me and telling me about how he learned about his act,
If your listening is that somebody doesn’t like
you, everything they say is an expression of not
liking you [Aletheia 3]. If we pushed Jodie hard
enough she could go back and remember that
“oh yeah, one of them was trying to be nice to
me once” [Aletheia 2].
“
Aletheia 2, then, is the meaningfulness we attend to, where some-
thing or someone occurs as meaningful in some way to us, which
in turn gives us our way to be with that something or someone.
Forgetting the as locks us into the fallenness of Aletheia 3: as
becomes is. Remembering the as transforms the is. This is the work
of The Forum: the disclosure of truth as unconcealment, and in the
clearing granted by Nothing the generation of a new possibility of
Being for human beings becomes available. ■

SPEAKING BEING
and I didn’t know what that was then, but I know what it is now. And that I don’t think I was
there for him, when I was divorced, and all the time from when he was three until he was four-
teen, I don’t think I was there for him, and I just wanted to tell him that. And he got it. He just
got it. He said, “I’m glad you know that.” And I have a lot of reasons that I could give you for
why I wasn’t there for him. But the fact of the matter is I just wasn’t there for him. I just didn’t
participate. The list is a mile long.
KIPP
It’s called your life.
ANABETH
Right, all the things I didn’t participate in. So now I have a question. Can I ask you a question?
KIPP
Sure.
ANABETH
The question is: So if you know that you were a six-year-old for all this time, but... and you’ve
worked with that and stayed with that...
KIPP
In other words, you can see your racket.
ANABETH
You can see your racket, and so you don’t have that anymore, so then... but you have some-
thing...
KIPP (responding to several participants laughing)
By the way—I think someone was laughing in the background, when you said, “you don’t have
that anymore.”
ANABETH
You have it.
KIPP
It’s still there...
ANABETH
It’s still there.
KIPP
...at all times and under all circumstances, ready to use your life.
ANABETH (continuing)
