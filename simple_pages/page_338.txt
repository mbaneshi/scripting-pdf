SPEAKING BEING
WES  (to Raphaela)
Did you ever see Chinese handcuff s? You stick your fi ngers in them. 
RAPHAELA
No.
WES
So imagine this gadget where you put your index fi ngers on either side of it, and then you go to 
pull your fi ngers out. You know what happens?
(to the group)
What happens?
(many answer together: “it tightens up”)
See, that’s your problem! You never stuck your fi ngers in a Chinese handcuff !
(laughter)
So you’re going to have to make this up. You stick your fi ngers in this thing. You pull on it and 
then it tightens. Can you get that?
RAPHAELA
Yeah.
WES
And then you pull on it more and it tightens. And the harder you pull to get your fi ngers out, 
the tighter it gets. Can you get that? That’s what’s happening right now. You are in a giant Chi-
nese handcuff . How do you like it? It’s called your life. 
RAPHAELA
I don’t like it.
WES
Good. That’s the fi rst recognition. If that makes any diff erence.
RAPHAELA
I don’t like to be wrong and for me being in a Chinese handcuff  is being able to be right.
WES
Yeah, it’s not a matter of being wrong. It’s just a matter of it doesn’t work. Not for someone who 
wants to live their life. Either way you’re going to die, so it’s just a conversation right now. But 
someday you’ll be dead and they’ll put on your tombstone: “lived her life fully,” or they’ll put 
there something like “tried to get out of the trap, and died...”
