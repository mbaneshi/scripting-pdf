Forum Day Four: Session One

Kipp handled a few logistical items (handing out seminar schedules for those who had received an
erroneous schedule, etc.). The course supervisor followed Kipp upon the stage to deliver several
announcements.
At 12:15 pm, The Forum adjourned for a break.

SPEAKING BEING
The Forgetting of Being, Part Seven of Eight: Logos
Are humans missing out on an important element of existence? How would we
know? How did this come about? Further, if this element is the experience of Being
that is available in The Forum, why does that experience occur as elusive—that is, as
something you get and lose and get and lose? To shed some light on these ques-
tions, we are following Heidegger’s history of Being.
As we proceed here, we invite you to read from the perspective that while
Heidegger’s project was supremely intellectual in its approach, it was not epistemo-
logical in nature: he did not want to help us to know more about Being, or to achieve
what we generally call a greater understanding. Rather, he wanted to create, through
thinking, a clearing for the presence of Being in the world. In his reading of the exist-
ing fragments of their writing, he finds evidence that the pre-Socratics experienced
this presence.
The Unconcealment of Being
The fifth and sixth centuries BCE were an extraordinary period in human evolu-
tion, giving rise to “a development in the art of philosophical inquiry that is quite
unparalleled in world history” (Wheelwright, The Presocratics 1). Language, by some
estimates, had entered our evolutionary path a million years earlier; and by the fifth
century, complex aspects of existence were emerging to be named, and dealt with.
There was a new level of demand for humans to understand themselves, and their
place in the world. The decisions made at this point, Heidegger says, have proven to
be decisive.
We have seen that for the Greeks, Being occurred as physis, the sway, an “over-
whelming coming-to-presence” of emerging possibilities. In a process of languaging
that Heidegger calls originary naming, the Greeks were engaged in a struggle to
create a world: “[T]his sway first steps forth from concealment—that is, in Greek,
aletheia (unconcealment) happens—insofar as the sway struggles itself forth as a
world. Through world, beings first come into being” (IM 67).
Physis, emerging as world, stands in the world in aletheia. Aletheia—
unconcealment—was for the Greeks self-blossoming appearance. Heidegger some-
times translated the word aletheia as “truth,” but at other times he was emphatic
that aletheia for the Greeks bore no relation to our usual notion of truth as the
correspondence of a proposition with its object. Aletheia, for the pre-Socratics, was

the truth of a being at its inception. To think aletheia, we must imagine an existential
moment—a moment of virginal emergence when a being is first available to be seen,
and thus first opened to being apprehended in the world before multiple perspec-
tives of its appearance have given rise to multiple propositions regarding its nature:
For the Greek essence of truth is possible only together
with the Greek essence of Being as physis. On the grounds
of the unique essential relationship between physis and
aletheia, the Greeks could say: beings as beings are true.
The true as such is in being. . . Truth belongs to the essence
of Being. (IM 112)

The idea challenges our thinking, immersed as we are in a persistent cacophony of
conflicting truth claims. But the view that beings as beings are essentially true was
grounded in a particular ontological/historical context: for the pre-Socratic thinkers,
physis was Being brought to stand in the world with beings, and in that context the
unconcealed beings stood in truth. The truth of beings was the truth of Being. We
cannot grasp that notion of truth—cannot imagine it, cannot bring it to thought—
because we have lost the requisite orientation to Being.
Truth as Freedom
Fundamental to that orientation, says Heidegger, is that the essence of its truth is
freedom. But this understanding of the situation calls for a shift in what our Western
tradition has considered to be the relation of freedom to truth. In that tradition,
freedom is a property of human beings, and consists in our freedom to say, and in
saying to judge what is true. This is the Cartesian model, with the balance of power
weighted on the side of the subject.
But now the emphasis in Heidegger’s view is the freedom that arises in
aletheia—in unconcealment, the freedom of the openness of the open region in
which beings are first revealed. This shift—from the freedom of the human sayer
to speak truth, to the freedom for beings to be the true things they are—is a central
movement in Heidegger’s later thinking: “Freedom now reveals itself as letting
beings be” (“OET” in BW 125). But this is not letting-be in the sense of neglecting, or
letting things alone. Here it means the opposite: “To let be is to engage oneself with
beings,” not by managing or planning but by an alert attunement to the open region
“into which every being comes to stand, bringing that openness, as it were, along
with itself” (“OET” in BW 125).
