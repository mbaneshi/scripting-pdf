Forum Day Three: Session One
181
ERHARD (to the group)
You’ve got to have advanced training to know that about yourself.
ANDY
My life’s been about being a sleaze. The question was “what do you care most about in life?”
and I said “I care about making a diff erence with people.” And I see that isn’t it. I care about
making a diff erence with young people and I could give a fuck about adults. And my actions
show that. So who I am with an adult is a snake in the grass.
ERHARD
That’s pretty popular. I’m for this and the hell with everything else. That doesn’t give you any
power with what you’re for.
ANDY (replaying a conversation he had)
So she said, “what do you get out of that?” I said, “well, I get to look good. Mr. morality. Mr.
right. Look like I’m honest—all the good stuff  that goes along with it. It was all fun and games
at fi rst.” “What’s the cost?” “I don’t see no cost. Maybe self-expression. Tell people what I’m
really thinking because I’m being manipulative.” “Well what about love?” “I could give a fuck
about love: I’ve got my family. I got all the love I need.” And then she said, “how could you do
what you do? You fucking hurt people, you use people, you lie. How would you feel if someone
was doing that to you all the time? And that’s all you’re doing.” And it does hurt. It hurts deep
inside. I was denying it.
KIPP (moving closer to Andy)
You were doing what you’ve done your entire life.
ANDY
I’m not denying it anymore. I am a sleaze.
KIPP
Being a sleaze is a nice handy phrase that doesn’t let you be present to what’s there in your life.
ANDY
I don’t trust adults.
KIPP
That’s a concept. “I don’t trust adults” is saying information about it.
(clapping his hands)
That sound is present. What’s present when you’re with adults?
ANDY
I don’t know.

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
See, you got hurt, didn’t you, when you were growing up?
ANDY
Yeah.
KIPP
See how you said “yeah”? So today your job is to get present to your own life. And you gloss
over it by saying you’re a sleaze. People aren’t interested in things, people are interested in you.
We give people things, we don’t give them our selves. You’re a guy walking around with a chip
on your shoulder, and the chip has become your life.
ANDY
Right.
ERHARD (coming forward)
Hold on, hold on a minute. A lot of people in here with a chip on their shoulder. How many
people in here have a chip on their shoulder? I’m looking around here to see if the right hands
are up.
Erhard pointed out a couple of people to indicate that they needed to have their hands raised. He
addressed one of them.
(continuing)
That costs you your beauty, you know that? You’re a beautiful woman. Nobody can see that
with that fucking chip on your shoulder; takes your power away from you.
KIPP
Anything more?
ANDY
Just that it is so powerful.
KIPP
Right. The chip on your shoulder uses your life.
ANDY
Like a drug.
KIPP
Thank you.
(applause)
