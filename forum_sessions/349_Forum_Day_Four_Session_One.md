Forum Day Four: Session One

is reasons. “Well I really tried to produce that result. And you know I tried this and I did that,
and this happened and this happened.” “Oh, I understand: Well, as long as you really tried;
as long as you really meant it; you really were sincere.” “I understand” often means, “Okay,
I’ll give you that one as long as you put up with my bullshit for not producing the result I said
I would produce. You’ll accept that then, too, right?” See you’re either at The Forum on time
or you’re not. You’re either on the airplane when it leaves or you’re not. The airplane does not
care about the traffi  c jam you got into. It just leaves, and you stand there like a jerk watching
it leave, complaining about the unfairness of life. You either keep your word or you don’t, with
regard to life. Life is not fair. Children think life should be fair. Some people—most peo-
ple—never grow out of that, and they argue about the fairness or unfairness of life, and their
reasons for what they have done and why they did it, and why it should have been this way,
and their story, and it’s all stuck together; and people are asleep, and what keeps them asleep
is reasonableness. And by the way, it is very real when you’re discussing it. The basis for your
reasonableness ultimately is your commitment to your story. But the level of living your life
we’re discussing now is called reasonableness, and it stinks. You know, like, we invite you to
participate in something and you will deal with “why are we doing that?” and “should I be do-
ing that?” and “how come we’re doing that?” and “what’s really happening?” And you’ll never
deal with the off er and the possibility of the off er. So one way to listen to Sarah’s sharing is:
Somebody who’s willing to give up reasons in her relationship with her son, and relate to him,
like straight, like “here’s what I say and I’ll take what you say and out of what we say to each
other, we’ll be committed to it as itself and not deal with all the story about it that’s not being
communicated.” So, she can acknowledge being an incompetent parent, which by the way
is only a conversation anyway—which I know you know—but it opens something up. That
conversation opens something up. She doesn’t have to explain it, and justify it, and make her
son wrong, like he’s the reason for her incompetence. He doesn’t have to deal with her reasons.
He can just deal with her self, and they can deal with each other. See: That’s a breakthrough.
That’s what’s possible in terms of participating in life when you can step out of your story, and
let the fl oor be there, let life be there, let your self be there, embrace it, and play with it. But you
have to give something up. You have to give up your signifi cance and your commitment to rea-
sonableness. You need to know what it looks like, really. What you look like—your story, and
your reasons for it, and the justifi cations for it—really are absurd. Time for another newspaper
article. I’m going to show you what a life looks like, carried to the extreme, when someone’s
commited to some meaning, some signifi cance, some reasons and justifi cations for their life.
Here Wes read a newspaper article which demonstrated reasonableness carried to an extreme. It
was the obituary, from the Los Angeles Times, of the musician Billy Tipton, who had died earlier in
1989. It was headed “Death reveals musician who lived as man to be woman.” At her death at the
age of 74, it was revealed to friends and family that Tipton, who had lived as a man, had been in
reality a woman. Tipton died poor, said Wes, and tired of keeping her secret.
WES
There you go. Aren’t you tired? Of keeping the secret? Think it’s worth giving the secret up?
You think it’s worth giving up what you’ve been withholding from life? You know what you’ve
been withholding from life? Your self. What you’ve been giving to life is your secret; what

SPEAKING BEING
you’ve been withholding from life is your self. And you put the two together and you look at life
from the possibility that you’re going to die: What’s the point? I mean really, what is the point?
Why not just give it up? Where’s Kevin? I wasn’t in the room earlier. I hear you turned in your
video release today. Congratulations. That’s giving something up. I invited you last night to
confront what it costs, the risk... you want to share about that?
KEVIN
Kind of funny, because after I got my standing ovation from everyone, I sat here thinking, “I
don’t want to put my hand up, because I’ve already received too much attention. So I’ll just sit
here.” And it took me about, I don’t know, a half an hour before I fi nally realized “I could put
my hand up and they could choose me whenever they wanted. I wasn’t in control...”
(laughter)
WES
That’s very good.
KEVIN
Yeah, I got a lot...
WES
Wait, let me just use that, because a number of people have been coming up to me demanding
I call on them to share. You ought to get what Kevin is saying. You either will or you won’t and
you’ll know it at the end of The Forum if you’ve been called on. Don’t worry about it because it
doesn’t mean anything anyway.
KEVIN
And you’re not going to get any more out of it if you’re called on.
WES
You want to listen. That’s when you get something out of The Forum. The Forum takes place in
your listening.
KEVIN
And I know that because as I was sitting here, I was thinking about that, “well, it doesn’t mat-
ter if I get called on, if I get called on, that’s fi ne, I get called on.”
ERHARD
It’s not even fi ne. You get called on, you get called on.
KEVIN
You’re right.
WES (continuing)
