Forum Day Three: Session Three 221
ERHARD
You don’t want my job: I’m a throwaway. You turn God into another racket, another way to
be right and make others wrong, another way to avoid the domination of the responsibility to
be human. They’re going to put your ass in a hole in the ground and throw dirt in your face
and that’s the end of that story. Don’t turn that into more bullshit. And don’t do it because
everybody else does. Tony, you kind of got there early. And it’s important to go through all the
parts of the conversation. We’re going to do that. Stick around. Thanks
TONY
Thank you.
Participants continued to share their experiences from the day.
BETH
When I did the last session, I immediately felt ripped off , because my girlfriend took this last
month. I already knew what was going to happen through the whole thing, and I...
ERHARD
Didn’t make that much of a diff erence, though, knowing what was going to happen, did it?
BETH
Right. And it’s because I didn’t stop myself and a lot of times I stop myself. And so I thought,
“okay, I’m going to do it,” and so I closed my eyes, and I was... stuck. And I thought: “Okay, I
want to get out of this” because I was thinking that this person was supposed to kill me and
the person next to me was going to kill me and that was too far removed from me. And so I
said okay, what other kind of fear do I have? And that kind of fear was the fear of intimacy.
(crying)
And that...
ERHARD
Slow down. Slow down. Go ahead.
BETH
That made me sad. But I felt good about being sad, because I was doing the process and I didn’t
stop myself and I still have the fear of intimacy. And I stop myself a lot of times by not taking
risks.
ERHARD
And you made a soap opera out of it.
(to the group)
And you stopped yourself a lot of times and you don’t take risks and that’s sad and you tried
and you struggled and then you gave up and fi gured the hell with it, and tried to be something

else instead of trying to be intimate and then you found out that that was no good, and so then
you went back to try to be intimate, and nah nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah nah,
nah nah, nah nah nah nah nah.
BETH
Right.
ERHARD (to the group)
Now I’m talking about you, not her. She just happens to be standing up so we got some way to
talk to you. You don’t want to listen to her soap opera. You want to listen to your soap opera,
your “what happened,” and the sad, and the struggle, the eff ort, and the sacrifi ce that you have
made, nah nah nah nah nah nah nah. Great, go on, you’re doing a good job.
(Beth remains silent)
What does that mean that you avoid intimacy? I don’t want to put words in your mouth if that’s
not the way you said it. Say it the way you said it. What does it mean?
BETH
That... I’m talking about a personal relationship...
ERHARD
I’m not asking you to explain it, I’m asking what it means. So what?
BETH
So what?
ERHARD
Yeah, so what? I asked you fi rst.
BETH
You mean, what do I do?
ERHARD
No, so what?
BETH
Yeah.
ERHARD
I mean, so what?
BETH
I avoid intimacy.
ERHARD (continuing)
