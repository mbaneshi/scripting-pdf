Forum Day Four: Session One
343
Kipp asked those who did not see possibility in empty and meaningless to stand. About fi fteen peo-
ple stood; one of them received a microphone.
WES
There’s just one last little piece stuck to it, a little piece of meaning stuck to it keeps possibility
from occurring.
Kipp confi rmed with those standing that they are yet to be “clear” about life being empty and
meaningless and that it is empty and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless.
ERHARD
Hold on. Is it that you don’t get it or you don’t like it? Which is it with you?
ANABETH
I don’t see either. I thought the question was: “do we see possibility?”
ERHARD
We’re restating the question. The question is: Did you get that it is empty and meaningless, and
that it’s empty and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless? Did you get that?
ANABETH
Yes.
ERHARD
Good, then we apologize for misleading you. You’re welcome to sit down now.
(several participants sitting down)
The only people who should be standing are those who didn’t get that it’s empty and meaning-
less and that it’s empty and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless. So that’s what you
didn’t get.
BRADLEY
I don’t think so.
ERHARD
Who should I ask?
(to a seated participant)
Did he get that?
(laughter)
Should I ask him? Who should I ask?
In the language of The Forum, the concern for looking good and
being right, inauthentic to the core, gets revealed as empty, as
lacking any ultimate ground, as utterly without meaning. That is,
the “they” self is not some inner self enclosed within the frame
of the external world; rather, it “is” only by virtue of Being-in-the-
world.
But if conscience occurs as a call, as a summons that passes
over the “they” self, what form does it take? What is said in the
call? The call is not vocal utterance; nevertheless, as calling, it is a
mode of discourse:
But how are we to determine what is said in
the talk that belongs to this kind of discourse?
k
What does the conscience call to him to whom
t
it appeals? Taken strictly, nothing. The call
asserts nothing, gives no information about
world-events, has nothing to tell. Least of
all does it try to set going a ‘soliloquy’ in the
Self to which it has appealed. ‘Nothing’ gets
called to this Self, but it has been summoned to
d
itself—that is, to its ownmost potentiality-for-
Being. (BT 318

“
The call of conscience, says Heidegger, is discourse in the mode
of silence, and its message is unequivocal: it says nothing: the
call speaks through what is left unsaid. Any misunderstanding
of this message is due not to its mis-calling, but to interference
from the soliloquy through which the “they” self (i.e., the socially
constructed identity) interprets the call (BT 318–19). Thus the
T
“nothing,” revealed in anxiety through the call of conscience,
holds the possibility of authentic self-revelation.
Throughout Heidegger’s thought we find the essentiality
of non-Being as the other side of Being; and Heidegger takes
full advantage of the rhetorical possibilities of the nothing,
recognizing the opportunities for paradox and reflexion which
arise in discussing a “something” which is “nothing.” We mean
“rhetorical” in two related senses. The first is its essential sense
as the use of language for the primal assignment of meaning as

SPEAKING BEING
BRADLEY
Me.
ERHARD
Did you get that?
BRADLEY
No, I’m still attaching meaning to it.
ERHARD
I’m not asking whether you are attaching meaning or not attaching meaning. You’re always
going to attach meaning.
BRADLEY
I will?
ERHARD
You are a machine that attaches meaning. As long as you’re functioning you will attach mean-
ing. However, it’s possible to attach meaning in the context that it’s empty and meaningless. It’s
possible to get that it’s empty and meaningless and attach meaning to it. See, this is not a con-
versation for convincing you of something. This is a conversation for leaving you dwelling in
the truth. Dwelling in the truth, you can’t use the truth. So the question is, did you get—and by
“get” I mean: “dwelling in” that it’s empty and meaningless? By “get” I mean: Are you “coming
from” that it’s empty and meaningless? Not: Are you attaching meaning to things?
BRADLEY
Yes.
ERHARD
Then you are welcome to sit down.
(addressing Jacob, standing)
You didn’t get it, right? You got it partly and partly you didn’t get it?
JACOB
Well I understand that, um, that a lot of times we try to take things for more than their face
value, which is what happened, and add a stupid story to it and try to give it meaning. But I was
wondering about your wording. When you say that it’s empty, is that where potential comes
from, or possibility?
ERHARD
Is that where what?
primordial metaphor (see the sidebar “Primordial Metaphor”
in the Second Session of Day Four)—or, in this case, the radical
undermining of meaning, since to bring Being (originative
meaning) to language we must also bring nothing to language,
and not merely ontically: the ontological saying of the nothing is
primal rhetoric.
The second sense of “rhetoric” is closer to the Aristotelian
tradition: that is, Heidegger, and especially Erhard, use the
language of nothing strategically, exploiting its paradoxical
y
possibilities to reorient the audience by revealing to that audience
its true relation to nothing and thus to Being. ■
