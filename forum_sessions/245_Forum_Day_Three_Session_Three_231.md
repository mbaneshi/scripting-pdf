Forum Day Three: Session Three 231
This, then, is what is happening in our speaking out: we speak out
from concealment; we unconceal a world of beings. How fortunate we
are that we have the ability to create meanings, and can thereby live in
a world of culture and technology, and reap their benefits.
But there is of course a qualifier to the promise in this
situation, which Heidegger finds elsewhere in Heraclitus’ writing:
ERHARD
Zen bullshit.
ANGEL
I’m from California.
ERHARD
That’s right. What was the last thing you said Kipp?
KIPP
You’re attached to being attached.
ERHARD (indicating Angel)
It was you. An emerging bit of light here. Attached to meaning. That’s what it was. He said you
were attached to meaning, and you said yesterday I was attached to caring and that made it
mean something. And today I’ve gotten down an even more fundamental level, “I’m attached
to meaning.”
ANGEL
Yeah.
ERHARD
Yeah. You are attached to meaning. That’s what there is to get. You are stuck with meaning.
You have no freedom. Everything’s got to be made to mean something. Everything’s got to be
made signifi cant. That’s the drama queen.
ANGEL
I don’t see what’s left.
ERHARD
So I’m gonna tell you. You want to know what’s left? Nothing. What’s left is nothing. I told you
we were going to work our way back to zero. This is zero.
ANGEL
I can’t be with zero.
ERHARD
I know. I told you it made me real sad. It’s not going to be all right. It’s going to be the way it is.
What there is to be with is that life is empty and meaningless. That’s what there is to be with. It
is not going to turn out. It is not going to be all right. It’s going to be whatever fucking way it is.
However it is.
ANGEL
No matter what I do?
Being loves to hide. Why this is so is a question for which Heidegger
does not specify an answer, since the question must be left  open.
In the swinging of that open question, thinking may distinguish
new paths into Being. For example, if The Forum is a conversation
for the emergence of Being, and if Being strives to conceal itself,
then interesting implications emerge about the nature of The
Forum experience, which we continue to explore and unfold in
these sidebars and intervals. ■
[I]f prevailing is torn from concealment in the
logos, then it must, as it were, try to conceal
itself. The very same Heraclitus tells us in
addition . . . why physis came to be revealed
and torn from concealment explicitly in legein.
In the collection of fragments one sentence
stands alone which to this day has never been
understood or comprehended in its profundity:
“The prevailing of things has in itself a striving
to conceal itself.” (FCM 27, emphasis added)

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Yeah, but see, there’s something a little off  in that, because you’re only going to do what you’re
going to do. People don’t do what they want to do; they do what they do. You always do what
you do. And you don’t always do what you want to do, do you? The only time you do what you
wanted to do is when it’s coincidentally what you did. You aren’t doing what you wanted to
do; you’re doing what you do. And you got this God damned story about wants. People don’t
do what they want to do; they do what they do, always and only. “Want to” is a story. Like
explaining illness with evil spirits. Voodoo. The stars will not move for what you want. You do
what you do, and you don’t do what you don’t do. And all the rest of it is some cockeyed story
that destroys the simplicity, the power, the sweetness of the way it is. Look, did you ever notice
you are never ever fucking satisfi ed? Ever! It doesn’t make any diff erence how good it is. It never
makes a diff erence what you achieve. Ever. Ever! You just can’t get that this is it. Kipp, tell them
about the practice life. Do your thing about the playing cards.
KIPP
The playing cards of life...
Kipp held up a pad of paper—as if they were cards—up to his chest.
KIPP
What it is to be a human being is to hold on to your aces. Because you know, that one time in
life when you gave away everything...
ERHARD
When you were a kid one time, you gave away your aces and you got smashed... Every one of
you. And from then on, you became “I don’t play my aces.” It wasn’t a decision merely or a
thought merely, from then on you became “I don’t play my aces.”
KIPP
You became what is known as a smart person. What a smart person looks like is a person who
walks around holding their aces. Then along came Einstein, and Einstein said the problems that
we got are not going to be solved with the way that we think we got into those problems...
ERHARD (interrupting Kipp)
Hold on, don’t fuck that quote up.
KIPP
You fuck it up.
(laughter)
ERHARD
The problems we have are not going to be solved at the level in which we created them. What
does that mean? It’s real simple. You got someplace in life. People have gotten someplace in
People don’t do what they want to do; they do
what they do. You always do what you do. And
you don’t always do what you want to do, do
you? The only time you do what you wanted to
do is when it’s coincidentally what you did.
