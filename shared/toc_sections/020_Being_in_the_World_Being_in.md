Forum Day One: Session One

PRELUDE
More than 700 people were assembled in the ballroom of the Hyatt Regency Hotel in San
Francisco on the morning of December 27th, 1989. This was the first day of The Forum, and the
occasion was unique in several ways. The first was that this Forum was to be led by Werner
Erhard himself. Although he had created the technology of language that constituted The
Forum, since 1973, to accommodate growing demand for the program across the United States
and in Europe, the course had increasingly been led by members of a growing body of est
Trainers, and later Forum leaders, a group of men and women trained by Erhard. As of 1989
there were forty-three Forum leaders, ten women and thirty-three men.
A second unique aspect of this four-day event was that it was an exceptionally large Forum
composed of various groups in addition to the 502 regular participants (the usual number
ranged from 100 to 250). Forty Forum leaders were also present as part of their training; during
breaks in the procedure, they met with Erhard for debriefing sessions that the senior author
attended as part of a special program for Forum graduates called Openings, a group of approx-
imately 100 participants who were permitted to observe without actively participating. Also
in the room were a number of invited observers who occupied a visitors’ gallery and whose
number varied during the course of The Forum. Last, a large contingent of staff and assistants
(volunteers) performed logistical duties throughout the four days.
Due to the efforts of the assistants, the ballroom set-up remained consistent across all
sessions of each of the four days. Regular participants and Forum leaders were seated in rows,
theater-style, before a raised platform which stretched across most of the width of the room,
and included a runway section extending well into the center of the audience area. Arranged
on the platform were three chalkboards, two bar-height director’s chairs, a music stand, and
a large table which held a water pitcher and glasses, tissues, and writing materials. Openings
participants and other observers were seated on risers at the rear of the room. Also at the rear
of the room was an enclosed translators’ booth: among the participants in Openings were
twenty-five observers from Japan, seminar leaders and staff members in the Tokyo office of
Werner Erhard and Associates. They listened to the proceedings in simultaneous translation
through earphones connected to the translators’ booth. Finally, three television cameras were
placed strategically around the room to record the event, and several television monitors were
placed so that most participants could watch the proceedings on video if they chose.
THE FORUM BEGINS
At 9:00 am, unannounced, Werner Erhard walked onto the platform. His manner was relaxed
and casual. He wore dark tan slacks, a white shirt open at the collar, and an olive sweater
vest. He greeted the participants in a friendly way, welcomed guests, and asked for questions
while late arrivals were completing their paperwork. He asked if there was anything about the
television cameras that needed clearing up, and he explained the presence of the Openings
participants and the observers seated in the Gallery. Someone asked about the people wearing
earphones, and he explained about the translators and participants from Japan. “That’s a good
question,” he said. “Questions like that . . . what about, what if?”
Participants who raised their hands were asked to stand and wait until they were given a
microphone; an assistant was stationed on each aisle to deliver one. After Erhard responded

SPEAKING BEING
Talking about Being
One of the similarities between the work of Werner Erhard and
Martin Heidegger is that both are designing a language for a
specific purpose: the evocation of Being. Since the debut of The
Forum in 1985, Erhard has regularly incorporated Heideggerian
terminology into his vocabulary, and has quoted Heidegger
extensively in his courses. It is the primary thesis of this book that
Erhard’s work is aligned in significant ways with the philosophy of
Martin Heidegger. Even the est Training, the beginnings of which
t
predate Erhard’s encounter with Heidegger (circa 1980), already
was aligned in significant ways with Heidegger’s thinking. This
alignment allowed Erhard to creatively incorporate Heideggerian
language in the delivery of what would become The Forum.
Heidegger’s language, on first encounter, is notoriously
difficult; he regularly invented new German terms for his ideas,
and translators have struggled to capture his meanings. Erhard
likewise uses words in unconventional ways, and calls his work
a “technology of language” in recognition of that fact. It is the
experience of the authors that a comparative inquiry into the two
bodies of work illuminates the thinking of both men, and helps
to clarify the linguistic complexity of Heidegger’s writing. In this
book, we intend gradually to unconceal (a Heideggerian term
l
Erhard has used) that clarity (IM 116).
This is not to say that either body of thought ever reaches the
kind of logical understandability that we generally expect in what
we read and hear. “If you walk out of here understanding,” Erhard
tells The Forum participants at one point, “that’s the booby prize.”
Both Heidegger and Erhard are attempting to communicate
something that, on that familiar level, cannot be communicated
or grasped. This is new territory for communication, and requires
both a new language (or, as Erhard says, new “languaging”) and a
new way of listening.
We request, therefore, that the reader join us in embracing
the atmosphere of questionability that must surround this entire
to several questions about the various colors of name tags worn by people in the room, one
participant raised her hand. Erhard called upon her to stand, and she asked about Erhard’s use
of language.
ERHARD
You need a language that gives you access to the kind of detail that you need to be a brain sur-
geon... The language you and I are going to use in here is also a specifi c language. It’s designed
to let you get at something you can’t get at without that language. Surgeons generally confi ne
that kind of speaking to the operating room, and so do I. I don’t use that language when I’m out
to dinner. For the most part it’s unseemly to use special language when you’re with people who
don’t share in that language.
Erhard asked for more questions. After he called on someone, he explained the reasons for
standing up and for calling on multiple people (“to allow time to get microphones to them”). She
asked about logistics. Erhard said it would happen later. She sat down.
BLAKE (after receiving a microphone from an assistant)
I don’t know whether The Forum started yet, but I wanted to get through my apprehension of
speaking before the group.
ERHARD
I suggest that those of you who have a fear of speaking take the same opportunity as Blake did.
In The Forum no one is required to stand up and speak, though it is in your interest to do so,
especially if you are reluctant to stand and speak.
Erhard also discussed the schedule of the course, pointing out that the daily ending time would be
sometime between 11:00 pm and 1:00 am, adding that
ERHARD
Nobody guarantees you that schedule. You want to be clear about that. We’re going to do this
as long as it takes to get it done.
In addition, he said, The Forum would not be complete until the completion of the evening session,
which would be held on the following Thursday evening—simultaneously in several cities, since
many participants in this Forum had traveled to San Francisco for this event. Participants were
encouraged to bring guests to their respective evening sessions.
As the conversation proceeded into the second hour, it gradually became clear, without transition,
that the serious business of the course had begun. A participant named Ruth rose to say that she
was pessimistic about getting the results of The Forum. Erhard began his response by acknowledg-
ing the validity of her doubt.

ERHARD
Very, very little in life turns out the way it was promised. So I remember my mother told me if I
was a good boy everything would be great in life. I tried it for one day and it didn’t work. People
are told that when they graduate life will be wonderful, life will be easy, and it didn’t turn out
that way. When you get married it’ll be great but it doesn’t turn out that way. People say when
you get divorced it’ll be all right but it doesn’t turn out that way. Most things don’t live up to
their promises.
RUTH
And what about the promises of The Forum?
ERHARD
Based on surveys, most people who’ve done this work say it turned out better than they expect-
ed. For you that’ll be easy, because you have a pessimistic view about how things’ll turn out.
We’ve got your six hundred dollars. You’re not going to get it back. Given that conversation’s
over, it’ll turn out however it turns out. You know, I’ve never been wrong about that.
(To Ruth)
I could say a lot of things to reassure you, and that would be a mistake. Your pessimism is you.
(raising his voice, he turned to the group)
Listen up! If you haven’t noticed, The Forum has begun. See, you and I think that our mood,
our internal state, the way we are seeing things; we think that is a product of the circumstanc-
t
es. So I look at something and I like it, or I look at something and I don’t like it. I think if I
like it, it’s the fault of the thing I’m looking at, and if I don’t like it, I think it’s the fault of the
thing I’m looking at. That’s the kind of thing that generates in me: “like”; and that’s the kind
of thing that generates in me: “don’t like.” You and I think that our way of being is a product of
what’s over there. As you will see as we do The Forum together a lot of what is going on with
you and me is something we already always are. It’s something I am before anything happens.
I’m kind of a pessimist waiting for life to happen, or I’m an optimist waiting for life to happen.
About certain kinds of things I’m a pessimist before I even look at them, and then when I look
at them, it’s hard for me to recognize that the pessimism isn’t generated out of the thing I’m
looking at, but it’s something I brought with me. Kind of like I was already always pessimistic
and then this thing came along. So it’s good that you’re pessimistic, and if you’re not pessimis-
tic, that’s good too.
(to Ruth)
If you find yourself being that way, don’t try to change it. What’s good is whatever you are,
because that’s what you want to bring into The Forum. If you deal with that pessimism
which you are in a certain way, you’ll have a choice about being pessimistic when it is ap-
propriate. Pessimism is not a bad idea, and if you didn’t have pessimism I would give it to
you, because one of the things you’re going to find in here is that we ask you not to believe
anything that’s said in here. We’ll talk more about that later. At any rate, the point that
project. There is a sense in which we don’t know what we are
talking about, and the emphasis in that sentence should be placed
on the word “know,” as implying a secure conceptual grasp.
Talking about Being is challenging and sometimes feels, to use
the vernacular, weird. Being is both pervasive and evanescent. It
is elusive, vanishing even as it appears.
In his writing about Being (and all of his writing is about
Being), Heidegger celebrates the ambiguity surrounding the topic.
This is “something which every thinker has to see afresh each
time, else he is not a thinker: that everything that lies before us is
ambiguous” (WCT 201). However, this does not mean fuzziness at
T
the expense of rigor:
NOTE:  Erhard believes that Heidegger’s use of the word
“thought” leaves people misled about what Heidegger
means in the following way: Perhaps the word “thought” is
valid for what is written down for people to consider, but it
did not come from “thinking”—by which most people will
understand “figuring it out”—it came from something like
“looking,” or “just being with,” and is pointed to by the word
“wonder” (Erhard, interview with the authors).
This multiplicity of possible interpretations
does not discredit the strictness of the thought
content. For all true thought remains open
to more than one interpretation—and this by
reason of its nature. Nor is this multiplicity of
possible interpretations merely the residue
of a still unachieved formal-logical univocity
which we properly ought to strive for but did
not attain. Rather, multiplicity of meanings is
the element in which all thought must move in
order to be strict thought. (WCT 71)
