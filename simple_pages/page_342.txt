SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
You are truly a heavy guy, aren’t you? 
KENNETH
Yes. And I’ve lost a lot of vitality in the last...
There was laughter from the participants, because the absence of vitality was so apparent. 
KIPP 
You’re also a master of understatement. 
KENNETH  (laughing)
And to have a certain façade that really I thought worked.
KIPP
And you have to keep that whole heavy and signifi cant thing in place!
KENNETH
Right. And then to fi nd out it doesn’t mean shit.
KIPP
Right.
KENNETH
Wooo!
KIPP
What it means is being heavy and signifi cant, and whatever else you say, that’s what it means.
KENNETH
Just before dinner last night I got light.
KIPP
Yeah, and it scared the shit out of you. You see it’s risky. See, what you already are is familiar. 
Being scared, sad, upset. That’s what you call “you.” Anything else is unfamiliar. Unfamiliar is 
awkward, embarrassing, so you’ll take anything that’s familiar, even if it’s destroying your life.
KENNETH
Yeah, at dinnertime I felt great, like maybe I could get off  this schtick. I had a real sense there 
of lightness and then I got heavy.
