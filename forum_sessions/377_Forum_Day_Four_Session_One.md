Forum Day Four: Session One

SALLY
I got what you were saying up until you were talking about talking.
ERHARD
Good and bad is talking. When you talk about good and bad you’re talking about talking.
SALLY
Okay, I got it.
ERHARD
Did you sort it out?
SALLY
Yeah, there’s just one more thing I want to ask.
ERHARD
Sure.
SALLY
So this morning, we got into a fi ght, my whole family...
ERHARD
Right. Families do that, don’t they?
SALLY
Yeah, all the time.
ERHARD
No: They do it when they do it and they don’t do it when they don’t do it.
SALLY
Right.
ERHARD
“All the time” is a story.
SALLY
Right. So we got in a fi ght this morning, and so I said “It doesn’t mean anything, so leave me
the fuck alone.”
ERHARD
Right. How many people have done that already: “It doesn’t mean anything, therefore...”
the transformation of human being arise in that very surrender of
human control to the unpredictable play of Being, the surrender
to the mutuality of the event of appropriation? The following
passage, in which Heidegger is thinking through a Parmenidean
fragment, suggests the essential and continual uncertainty
constitutive of the three-fold path he posits, “that of Being, that
of not-Being, and that of seeming”:
Superior knowing [. . .] is granted only to one
r
who has experienced the sweeping storm on
the way of Being, to whom the terror of the
second way to the abyss of Nothing has not
remained foreign, and who has still taken
over the third way, the way of seeming, as a
constant and urgent need. To this knowing
belongs what the Greeks in their great age
called tolma: to dare everything with Being,
not-Being, and seeming all at once—that is,
to raise Dasein above itself into the de-cision
about Being, not-Being, and seeming.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (continuing; participants raising hands)
You’re scum, I know that.
(laughter)
We told you not to do that and you did it right away, and if you haven’t yet, you will. Sleazy.
SALLY
I’ve also found myself wanting to do the same thing with them. It’s only bad if you make it
mean something bad.
ERHARD
No, it’s bad because it’s bad. But you have to understand whence bad arises, or bad disempow-
ers you. You can’t avoid bad. Bad’s there. Like I said, go out and do something illegal, and you’ll
fi nd out about what bad is.
SALLY
So what if I don’t think something’s bad but my dad does?
ERHARD
Who pays the food bills in your house?
SALLY  (laughing)
He does. So it doesn’t matter if I think something’s bad or not.
ERHARD
Sure it matters if you think it’s bad. But look, what you’ve got is not the same kind of authority
that your father has because you don’t pay the bills. So if you’re going to deal with the way you
see things and the way he sees things, you’re going to have to deal with it in a diff erent method
than he does. He deals with it like he pays the bills. You can’t deal with it like that, because you
don’t pay the bills. You’ve got to fi nd another way to deal with it. Did you hear what I said?
SALLY
I think so. What I do costs him money, so...
ERHARD
No, what I mean is, he’s got authority. You don’t have authority. You’re not the boss in his
house, he is, right?
SALLY
Yeah.
