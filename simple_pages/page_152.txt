SPEAKING BEING
The Forum resumed at 4:20 pm. Kipp returned to the platform and called for participants to share 
what they had discovered about their rackets.
KIPP
We asked you to distinguish sharing yourself. The time in The Forum for explaining your life is
f
over.
JODIE
I want a relationship.
KIPP
Are you sharing or talking about?
JODIE
I don’t know.
KIPP
My racket is... My payoff  is... The way my racket shows up in my life is... Share the juice.
JODIE
My racket is that I want a relationship. And every time one appears I sabotage it, so that it
doesn’t happen. 
KIPP
What’s the truth?
JODIE
I’m not in a relationship.
KIPP
No. What’s authentic is “if I had a relationship, I’d be wrong. What gets me up in the morning is
how I can avoid being in a relationship.” And the racket is that you say what?
JODIE
That I want a relationship.
KIPP
Who do you get sucked into the racket? There’s a distinction called “on the court.” There’s
another distinction called “up in the stands talking about what’s on the court.” What your life is
about is not having a relationship. How do you feel about that?
