Forum Day Four: Session One
341
KEVIN
So to this young person who doesn’t have much time left to get something out of this Forum.
ERHARD
Never mind the editorial.
KEVIN
This person is looking forward to really getting the job done at the next event, because this 
person’s talking about the next event, where this person’s going to get the job done. And I don’t 
think this person’s going to get the job done in the next event unless they start right now get-
ting the job done at this event. That’s what I have to say.
(applause)
WES
Kevin, I appreciate your generosity, so I’m gonna share a poem with you. 
Here Wes read the e e cummings poem, “What gets you is nothing.”
WES (completing the poem)
So you’ve been gotten, and what got you is nothing. It is inescapable. What there is to be gotten 
by—to be used by—in The Forum is nothing. If that now sounds like possibility to you, if now 
you hear that communication as possibility—you don’t understand it...
KEVIN
I feel like I understand it.
WES
Maybe you do. I’m saying, even if you don’t. If it just has that sense of possibility to it, raise 
your hand. 
(most of the participants raising their hands)
How many don’t?
(a few raising their hands) 
Okay. So are you complete Kevin?
KEVIN
No. I still have my homework assignment. 
WES
Those who don’t: Your job is to transform the conversation we’re having now, somehow, into 
possibility. You notice that a lot of people in the room have done that. That’s your job now. 
Your job. That’s where the value of your money occurs.
