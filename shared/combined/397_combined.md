Forum Day Four: Session Two
383
to that was: “Oh we have to do this again? I have to go back to when I was six-years-old?” But it
didn’t take very long for me to see that that’s where I was, for a long time. And I always have a
reason for why I’m not there. But I really am there. So it goes back to an incident that happened,
not when I was six, but when I was like twelve or thirteen, and I just wasn’t there for my sister. I
just wasn’t there and I had wonderful reasons for it. The best reasons. I was always the best kid,
the best sister; so I never got anything for it: I just wasn’t there.
KIPP
You lived inside a story called “I’m the best kid,” which gave you a justifi cation for anything that
happened that was inconsistent with that.
ANABETH
Right. So yesterday, I called my son, who is twenty-one. I have four children, but he’s the only
one I called because I got that he could listen to it, because he’s had an experience somewhat
like The Forum.
KIPP
This is another reason by the way. More crap, right?
ANABETH
The reason I called Johnny?
KIPP
“Well, you know Johnny, he’s like that.”
ANABETH
No, no, no. That’s not it.
KIPP
Okay.
ANABETH
I called Johnny because I wanted to tell him that I was proud of him. And when I couldn’t reach
him, I thought well, “I’ll call one of my other kids.”
KIPP
Is it true that you couldn’t reach him or that you didn’t reach him?
ANABETH
I did not reach him. He was not on the other end of the phone call. He was out. So I called another
number where he was supposed to be, and he was out at that number too. So I just kept calling
all day long until I fi nally got him woken up to come to the phone. I called him: I could tell him
how proud I was of him, and for calling me and telling me about how he learned about his act,
If your listening is that somebody doesn’t like
you, everything they say is an expression of not
liking you [Aletheia 3]. If we pushed Jodie hard
enough she could go back and remember that
“oh yeah, one of them was trying to be nice to
me once” [Aletheia 2].
“
Aletheia 2, then, is the meaningfulness we attend to, where some-
thing or someone occurs as meaningful in some way to us, which
in turn gives us our way to be with that something or someone.
Forgetting the as locks us into the fallenness of Aletheia 3: as
becomes is. Remembering the as transforms the is. This is the work
of The Forum: the disclosure of truth as unconcealment, and in the
clearing granted by Nothing the generation of a new possibility of
Being for human beings becomes available. ■

SPEAKING BEING
and I didn’t know what that was then, but I know what it is now. And that I don’t think I was
there for him, when I was divorced, and all the time from when he was three until he was four-
teen, I don’t think I was there for him, and I just wanted to tell him that. And he got it. He just
got it. He said, “I’m glad you know that.” And I have a lot of reasons that I could give you for
why I wasn’t there for him. But the fact of the matter is I just wasn’t there for him. I just didn’t
participate. The list is a mile long.
KIPP
It’s called your life.
ANABETH
Right, all the things I didn’t participate in. So now I have a question. Can I ask you a question?
KIPP
Sure.
ANABETH
The question is: So if you know that you were a six-year-old for all this time, but... and you’ve
worked with that and stayed with that...
KIPP
In other words, you can see your racket.
ANABETH
You can see your racket, and so you don’t have that anymore, so then... but you have some-
thing...
KIPP (responding to several participants laughing)
By the way—I think someone was laughing in the background, when you said, “you don’t have
that anymore.”
ANABETH
You have it.
KIPP
It’s still there...
ANABETH
It’s still there.
KIPP
...at all times and under all circumstances, ready to use your life.
ANABETH (continuing)
Forum Day Four: Session Two
385
ANABETH
So it’s just there.
KIPP
Yeah, it’s just there, and sometimes it uses your life.
ANABETH
Well yeah, that’s the answer.
KIPP
What’s missing for you is any choice about it.
ANABETH (pausing thoughtfully
(
)
What’s missing for me is any choice about it.
KIPP
Yeah, so far in your life, your life has not been a chronicle of choosing whether you’re going to
do your racket or not. Your racket used you, without choice.
ANABETH
Right. I did not choose. Right.
KIPP
So, what’s missing for you is a distinction called “choice.” See, when you come from empty and
meaningless, into life, you’re left with a choice. But we haven’t distinguished choice yet; we’re
still working on reasonableness. Can you see that that’s missing for you?
ANABETH
Yes. Okay.
KIPP
Anabeth: thank you very much.
(applause)
CLAUDIA
I saw that what stops me from participating is the fear that I have of all you people, which...
386
SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
It’s not fear. Remember, fear is inside the box of the racket. Fear is the emotion consistent with
the racket. It’s not the fear. It’s the racket. And the racket has those emotions. It has the feelings
consistent with that racket. Yeah.
CLAUDIA
What I saw in the danger process yesterday was that the reason I was afraid of other people, I
was afraid of everybody looking at me. One of my rackets is handling everything so that in my
relationships or at my job, everything is so set that people aren’t looking at me.
KIPP
What do you mean “looking at you”?
CLAUDIA
I mean looking at me with your eyes.
KIPP
You’re afraid of people looking at you.
CLAUDIA
Yes.
KIPP
Got it.
CLAUDIA
So, that has really stopped me from participating. This year I had lots of opportunities to speak
in front of people, and although one on one people have told me that I am articulate, and some-
times entertaining, I thought I would be good at speaking in front of groups of people and I was
miserable at it. I didn’t do very well and they criticized me in feedback.
KIPP
Or: You did what you did.
CLAUDIA
I did what I did. I didn’t enjoy it...
KIPP
You did what you did and people said what they said. The problem is you listened to them.
CLAUDIA
Right. So I realized that I stayed away from things that would cause me to stand up in front of
people to speak.
Forum Day Four: Session Two
387
KIPP
Do you understand what she’s saying? She says your life is designed by your case, by your rack-
et. You get a life inside your case. And that’s your life. You don’t do things that are inconsistent
with your racket.
CLAUDIA
Right, and the other thing... The reason that I don’t want anybody to look at me is because, um,
can I say “I’m afraid”? I’m afraid of being unattractive. And so I’m always unattractive from the
context of being attractive or unattractive...
KIPP
Is that how you say it to yourself, is that “you’re unattractive,” or what?
CLAUDIA
No. I don’t want anyone to look at me because they’re going to notice or judge and decide
whether they fi nd me attractive or not.
KIPP
Well, what do you think? Are you attractive?
CLAUDIA
Well, seeing that life is empty and meaningless...
(laughter)r
KIPP
Good. See all the service those people paid to let her speak like this?
CLAUDIA
So, I attract people when I attract people and I don’t when I don’t.
KIPP
Yeah.
(applause)
CLAUDIA
And the other thing that it has cost me from participating in, and what I’ve been noticing here is...
WES
Notice how the signifi cance of all that has disappeared: this whole thing about attraction. Most
relationships... how signifi cant can a relationship really be when most relationships are like two
slot machines face-to-face waiting for a simultaneous jackpot?
388
SPEAKING BEING
(laughter)r
CLAUDIA
So the other way I didn’t participate, because I had being unattractive and attracting people
caught up with one aspect of being female, of being a woman I should say.
KIPP
Aren’t they the same thing?
CLAUDIA
Female is more scientifi c for me.
KIPP
That’s fi ne. You’ve got to educate me. I’m stupid.
CLAUDIA
So it stopped me from enjoying certain aspects of being a woman.
KIPP
Yes, this is the important part.
CLAUDIA
And now it kind of unhooked a lot of those experiences from being an attractive woman. I
could just be a woman, be a person, enjoy those pleasures of...
KIPP
Well, you’re not going to use that conversation to not participate in your own life is what I hear.
CLAUDIA
Yeah.
KIPP
Well done, Claudia. Thank you very much.
(applause)
KIPP
See, where this is really going to be evident for you is in your conversations with other
people. If you notice, if this strikes true, then put it on: that a lot of your conversations with
other people are, that you get people to buy your reasons. What you call your friends, your
pals, are people that buy your reasons. So when you don’t do what you say you’re going to
Forum Day Four: Session Two
389
do, then you have your pals there, and you go up to them and you say, “you know that thing
I said I was going to do? Well I didn’t do it, but you know what happened? You know how
my mother... and I was busy, I got real afraid, and I didn’t feel real good, either. You under-
stand, right?” And of course my pal’s job—if he’s my friend, my buddy—his job is to buy
my reasons. Why? So when he doesn’t do what he said he was going to do, he’s got his mark
all set up. So he comes to me and says “Hey Kipp, remember that thing I said I was going to
do? Well I didn’t do it because...” What a lot of your friendships are based on is buying each
other’s reasons—interlocking conspiracies of disloyalty. That’s what you call your friends:
people who buy your crap. See, if somebody comes along and sticks your crap back in your
face, you get offended. Those are the people who are going to make some kind of difference
in your life. The ones that are straight with you. You’ve got the people in your life trained to
not be straight with you. You better find some people in life to be straight with you—they
aren’t going to be so reasonable.
WES
One of the things you can count on in the seminar program is the conversations you’re going to
have there are going to be very unreasonable.
(shifting)
So, we’re practicing a new conversation that involves the destruction of reasons and the creation
of participation. I want you to turn to the person next to you and practice this conversation. So
get a partner...
Participants organized themselves into pairs with Wes assisting them.
WES
Here’s what you’re going to say: “In this part of my life I didn’t participate, and these are
the reasons I’ve used.” And while saying this, see if you’re willing to give up these reasons,
and if you are, then create some way of saying how you’re now going to participate there.
You’re creating a commitment to participate. You’ll notice you don’t even need to give a
reason for it. You’re just sort of saying you will and you’re confronting the reasons for not.
Listen for the possibility of participating in life rather than to the reasons for not. Pick who
will go first. Ready? Begin.
Participants shared with each other for several minutes. Wes directed participants to provide feed-
back, then to switch roles. Wes then gave the participants another opportunity to share once again
with their partners, after having reiterated the instructions, emphasizing the requirement to clearly
state what the reasons were for not participating in life (“why you shouldn’t, wouldn’t, or couldn’t...”),
and to express willingness to give up the reasons.
WES
Stop. Please acknowledge the person who shared with you. We’ve begun a conversation for
participating in life. One of the things we want to deal with is where people get stuck in their
390
SPEAKING BEING
lives, how they get stuck in their lives, and a way of shifting that. The fundamental place where
people get stuck is in their problems. You know the problems you have in life? You can have a
breakthrough in the matter of your problems. Parts of the conversation will be fairly abstract.
You want to give up your considerations about abstractions. To get a sense of what your prob-
lems are, look at places in your life where you are stuck. You’ll notice that that’s a place you
never would in a million years fi nd it possible to participate. There’s a real problem there. Get
up some of your real problems for yourself. What are some synonyms for problems? Looking at
a real problem in life?
Participants shouted out various answers: diffi  culty, stopped, upset, stuck, barrier, worries, suff ering,
concerns, burden, hassle.
WES
Fundamentally what a problem is, is something is stopped: Something is stuck. The way in
which you are dealing with it is: There is a stuckness. There’s not movement. When you’re
moving, you’re not stuck. You may be dealing with something. It may be diffi  cult to deal with
but it doesn’t occur as a problem. Problems are places you are ineff ective. And you are ineff ec-
tive, obviously, because of circumstances, reasons, situations, and so forth. The fi rst thing to
look at is where problems occur. You can’t be eff ective with something if you don’t know its
location. So if I try to move the chair and I think the chair is here...
(indicating a location on the stage in which there is not a chair)r
...the chair’s not going to be moved. So we have to get where problems occur. A problem
seems to occur in the world, doesn’t it? Think of your problems: Somehow the problem is out
there. And that’s what makes it so diffi  cult to deal with: It’s out of your control. And out there
where it lives is very big. And fundamentally that’s the thing that makes people ineff ective
with problems, because problems don’t occur out there. There are no problems, as problems,
out there. “I’ve got cancer. It’s in my body.” The cancer may be in your body, but the problem
you’ve got with the cancer isn’t in your body. “My car is a piece of crap. That’s a real problem
for me.” There’s no problem with your car. The cancer as a problem, your car as a problem, your
children as a problem, are not out there. Problems don’t occur in the world as problems. Rocks
don’t have problems, even the ones that get kicked and fall down the hill. That is not a problem
for the rock. See if you can point at where problems are. Take a shot.
(indicating his mouth)
I didn’t say there are no problems. There are problems. They just don’t occur out there. They occur
over here. They are in your speaking and your listening. Or more rigorously, problems are in lan-
guaging. No languaging, no problems. The home of problems is languaging. The home of reality,
for life for human beings, is in languaging. The occurrence “problems” occurs in languaging.
Rocks don’t speak and listen, and so don’t have the problems human beings have as problems.
PAULA
Is languaging and distinguishing the same thing? What about signing?
WES (continuing)
Forum Day Four: Session Two
391
WES
They are close enough for now. People who sign are participating in languaging. Here’s what
I’m including in languaging: picturing, signing, speaking, music-ing: that whole range of
human activities in which communication takes place. The easiest thing for us to talk about is
speaking and listening.
PAULA
What about touching?
WES
What about touching?
PAULA
To me, touching can be communicating.
WES
It can be, and it may not be...
PAULA
Are you including it...?
WES
...if it’s an intentional communication.
PAULA
Okay.
(sits down)
WES
Okay, so problems occur in languaging. Is there anyone who cannot see that? Clear enough.
Close enough... for government work.
(laughter)r
DAVID
I’m not really clear that the problem is in languaging.
WES
Yeah. Where is it? Give me a problem you got?
DAVID
Fully participating in the projects that I do. Getting excited by the projects.
392
SPEAKING BEING
WES
There are two things there: fully participating and getting excited.
DAVID
Getting really excited about the projects I’m involved in.
WES
“I do projects. I’m not excited. That’s a problem for me.” Is that how it goes?
DAVID
Yes.
WES
See the languaging there?
DAVID
Yes.
WES
That’s where the problem is.
DAVID
Thank you.
WES
You’re welcome.
(laughter; David sits)
So now that we’ve put it into the domain of languaging, we have some access to them. If you can
locate problems where they are, that is to say, in languaging, you now have an access to dealing
with problems that will allow for a breakthrough in problems. We’re now going to deal with the
real breakthrough in problems. This is what you all need to get is the next thing I deal with. I
deal with a little bit more, but this is it. You want to fi nd the specifi c box... I want you to imagine:
Languaging has many boxes. Make believe: Many boxes in languaging; many possibilities for
things to occur in within languaging. We want to fi nd the specifi c box that problems occur in.
Problems occur in one box only for human beings. It doesn’t show up as a box, because people
think their problems are “out there,” shows up like “out there.” But now that you know that it
shows up in a box in languaging, we have to fi nd the box. Knowing the box will give us some
power with regard to our problems. It’ll actually blow the whole thing open.
Wes moved to the chalkboard, drew a square, and wrote “problems” inside it.
Forum Day Four: Session Two
393
So, here are problems. Whatever problem you got occurs here, in languaging. What is the name
of the box that problems come in?
PARTICIPANT
Declaration.
WES
No. Ultimately, yes, okay? But you’re a little too advanced for us. I want to know the specifi c
kind of declaration that problems occur in.
(referring to participants with yellow name tags, who are there taking The Forum for the fi rst time)
I want some yellows to answer this. I don’t want anybody “remembering” this.
A participant named Paul stood, the participant who, like Jake, had his “foot nailed to the fl oor”
concerning inauthenticity in a dialogue with Erhard in Session Two of Day One.
PAUL
You talked about being a problem. We talked about it being an obstacle before. What fi rst occurs
to me as the name of the box that problems come in is the problem box.
WES
No. Well, yes, but not useful.
PAUL
But what is the problem is really what the problem is and the problem is trying to label it. I
would think that it’s an obstacle and all the other things people would say it is.
WES
It’s not a box that shows itself to you. You remember we did that discussion? You remember that
“danger interaction”? The thing we did yesterday?
PAUL
How could I forget?
WES
Remember, we had a lot of stuff  go on the board. Then I proposed the possibility that there was
a frame around all of it, that all of it was variations of, like a meme, of “Life is dangerous for
human beings.” We’re looking for some statement like that. What is the statement that...
PAUL
You are the problem. You become the problem. Within that framework that’s...
394
SPEAKING BEING
WES
Yeah. Okay. That’s not how problems occur. Problems don’t occur for people “I am the problem.”
PAUL
Okay.
WES
When my car is broken, the car is the problem. And there’s a way my conversation occurs, my
relationship to all of that.
PAUL
Okay.
WES
You can just keep looking. You got it started well, though.
PAUL
Um, so you’re saying that the box in which problem occurs has a name to it...
WES
A statement in which it occurs has a particular name to it. The conversation occurs in “hu-
man being.” It’s the already always conversation. You know, you’re born into languaging, and
languaging gives you your life, reality, and problems: Once a problem comes your way, there’s
an already always way it occurs for you. That’s the box: the already always way it occurs for you.
You have nothing to do with it. You didn’t choose it...
PAUL
It’s the rainstorm.
WES
It’s the rainstorm. We want to get a sense of the already always way it occurs for you. This is one
of those “too simple for complicated minds...”
PAUL (laughs)
Okay, then maybe the problem is your racket.
WES
No, that’s an explanation of it maybe. We’re looking for the statement.
PAUL
The statement that contains the problem...

به این بود: "اوه ما باید دوباره این کار را انجام دهیم؟ من باید وقتی شش ساله بودم به آن برگردم؟" اما
خیلی طول نکشید که من برای مدت طولانی ببینم که در آنجا هستم. و من همیشه یک
دلیل اینکه چرا من آنجا نیستم. اما من واقعاً آنجا هستم. بنابراین به حادثه ای که اتفاق افتاد برمی گردد ،
نه وقتی شش ساله بودم ، اما وقتی مثل دوازده یا سیزده ساله بودم ، و من فقط برای خواهرم در آنجا نبودم. من
فقط آنجا نبود و دلایل فوق العاده ای برای آن داشتم. بهترین دلایل من همیشه بهترین بچه بودم ،
بهترین خواهر ؛ بنابراین من هرگز برای آن چیزی نگرفتم: من فقط آنجا نبودم. کله
شما در داخل داستانی به نام "من بهترین بچه هستم" زندگی می کردید که برای هر چیزی که به شما توجیهی می داد
اتفاق افتاد که مغایر با آن بود. آناب
درست بنابراین دیروز با پسرم تماس گرفتم که بیست و یک سال دارد. من چهار فرزند دارم ، اما او تنها است
یکی را صدا کردم زیرا متوجه شدم که او می تواند به آن گوش کند ، زیرا او تا حدودی تجربه ای داشته است
مثل انجمن کله
این دلیل دیگری است که اتفاقاً. تله بیشتر ، درست است؟ آناب
دلیل اینکه من جانی را صدا کردم؟ کله
"خوب ، شما جانی را می شناسید ، او چنین است."
آناب
نه ، نه ، نه. این نیست کله
خوب آناب
من به جانی زنگ زدم زیرا می خواستم به او بگویم که به او افتخار می کنم. و وقتی نتوانستم برسم
او ، من خوب فکر کردم ، "من یکی از بچه های دیگرم را صدا خواهم کرد."
کله
آیا این درست است که شما نمی توانید به او برسید یا اینکه به او نرسیدید؟ آناب
من به او نرسیدم. او در انتهای تماس تلفنی نبود. او بیرون بود بنابراین من به دیگری زنگ زدم
شماره ای که قرار بود او باشد ، و او نیز در آن شماره قرار داشت. بنابراین من فقط تماس می گرفتم
تمام روز تا زمانی که من او را از خواب بیدار کردم تا به تلفن بیایم. با او تماس گرفتم: می توانم به او بگویم
چقدر به او افتخار کردم و به من زنگ زد و به من گفت که چگونه او در مورد عمل خود آموخته است ،
اگر گوش دادن شما این است که کسی دوست ندارد
شما ، هر آنچه که آنها می گویند بیان نیست
دوست داشتن شما [Aletheia 3]. اگر جودی را سخت فشار دادیم
به اندازه کافی او می توانست برگردد و آن را به یاد بیاورد
"اوه بله ، یکی از آنها سعی داشت خوب باشد
من یک بار "[Aletheia 2]."
Aletheia 2 ، معناداری است که ما در آن شرکت می کنیم ، جایی که
چیز یا کسی به نوعی برای ما معنادار است ، که
به نوبه خود راه خود را به ما می دهد تا با آن چیزی یا شخصی باشیم. فراموش کردن AS ما را به سقوط Aletheia 3 قفل می کند:
می شود به یاد آوردن AS Transforms IS. این کار است
از انجمن: افشای حقیقت به عنوان عدم پذیرش ، و در
پاکسازی که توسط هیچ چیز به نسل امکان جدید اعطا می شود
بودن برای انسانها در دسترس قرار می گیرد. ■
384
وجود
و من نمی دانستم که در آن زمان چیست ، اما می دانم اکنون چیست. و فکر نمی کنم من باشم
در آنجا برای او ، هنگامی که من طلاق گرفتم و تمام وقت از زمان سه سالگی تا چهار سالگی
نوجوان ، من فکر نمی کنم من برای او آنجا بودم و فقط می خواستم این را به او بگویم. و او آن را گرفت. او فقط
دریافت کرد او گفت ، "من خوشحالم که شما این را می دانید." و دلایل زیادی دارم که می توانم به شما بدهم
چرا من برای او آنجا نبودم. اما واقعیت موضوع این است که من فقط برای او نبودم. من فقط این کار را نکردم
شرکت کنید این لیست یک مایل به طول است. کله
این زندگی شما نامیده می شود. آناب
درست است ، تمام چیزهایی که من در آن شرکت نکردم. بنابراین اکنون یک سوال دارم. آیا می توانم از شما سوالی بپرسم؟ کله
مطمئناً آناب
سوال این است: بنابراین اگر می دانید که شما در این مدت شش ساله بودید ، اما ... و شما
با آن کار کرد و با آن ماند ... کیپ
به عبارت دیگر ، می توانید راکت خود را ببینید. آناب
شما می توانید راکت خود را ببینید ، بنابراین دیگر آن را ندارید ، بنابراین ... اما شما
چیز ... KIPP (پاسخ به خندیدن به چندین شرکت کننده)
به هر حال - فکر می کنم کسی در پس زمینه می خندد ، وقتی گفتید ، "شما ندارید
دیگر. "
آناب
شما آن را دارید کله
هنوز آنجاست ... آناب
هنوز آنجاست کله
... در همه زمان ها و در هر شرایطی ، آماده استفاده از زندگی خود هستید. Anabeth (ادامه)
روز چهارم: جلسه دو
385
آناب
بنابراین فقط آنجاست کله
بله ، فقط آنجاست ، و گاهی اوقات از زندگی شما استفاده می کند. آناب
خوب ، بله ، این جواب است. کله
آنچه برای شما گم شده است ، هر انتخابی در مورد آن است. آناب (مکث فکر
(
)
آنچه برای من گم شده است ، هر انتخابی در مورد آن است. کله
بله ، تا کنون در زندگی شما ، زندگی شما در انتخاب این که آیا شما قصد دارید یک وقایع نبوده است
راکت خود را انجام دهید یا نه. راکت شما بدون انتخاب از شما استفاده کرد. آناب
درست من انتخاب نکردم درست کله
بنابراین ، آنچه برای شما گم شده است ، تمایز به نام "انتخاب" است. ببینید ، وقتی از خالی و
بی معنی ، به زندگی ، شما با یک انتخاب باقی مانده اید. اما ما هنوز انتخاب متمایز نکرده ایم. ما هستیم
هنوز روی استدلال کار می کند. آیا می توانید ببینید که این برای شما گم شده است؟ آناب
بله خوب کله
آناب: بسیار متشکرم. (تشویق)
کلودیا
من دیدم که آنچه من را از مشارکت باز دارد ، ترس از همه شما مردم است که ... 386
وجود
کله
این ترس نیست به یاد داشته باشید ، ترس درون جعبه راکت است. ترس احساسی است که با آن سازگار است
راکت این ترس نیست این راکت است و راکت آن احساسات را دارد. احساسات دارد
سازگار با آن راکت. بله کلودیا
آنچه دیروز در روند خطر دیدم این بود که دلیل ترس از افراد دیگر ، من
از همه به من نگاه می کرد. یکی از راکت های من دست زدن به همه چیز است به طوری که در من
روابط یا در کار من ، همه چیز چنان تنظیم شده است که مردم به من نگاه نمی کنند. کله
منظورتان "نگاه کردن به تو" چیست؟ کلودیا
منظورم این است که با چشمانت به من نگاه کن. کله
شما از افرادی که به شما نگاه می کنند می ترسید. کلودیا
بله کله
دریافت کرد کلودیا
بنابراین ، این واقعاً من را از مشارکت باز دارد. امسال فرصت های زیادی برای صحبت داشتم
در مقابل مردم ، و گرچه یکی از افراد به من گفت که من مفصل هستم ، و برخی
اوقات سرگرم کننده ، من فکر کردم که در جلوی گروه های مردم خوب صحبت خواهم کرد و من بودم
بدبخت در آن من خیلی خوب کار نکردم و آنها در بازخورد از من انتقاد کردند. کله
یا: شما کاری را که انجام دادید انجام دادید. کلودیا
من کاری را که کردم انجام دادم. من از آن لذت نبردم ... کیپ
شما کاری را که انجام دادید انجام دادید و مردم آنچه را که گفتند گفتند. مشکل این است که شما به آنها گوش داده اید. کلودیا
درست بنابراین فهمیدم که از چیزهایی که باعث می شود جلوی ایستادگی کنم ، دور ماندم
مردم صحبت می کنند. روز چهارم: جلسه دو
387
کله
آیا می فهمید که او چه می گوید؟ او می گوید زندگی شما توسط پرونده شما طراحی شده است ، توسط قفسه شما
et شما در پرونده خود زندگی می کنید. و این زندگی شماست شما کارهایی را انجام نمی دهید که متناقض باشند
با راکت خود کلودیا
درست است ، و چیز دیگر ... دلیل اینکه من نمی خواهم کسی به من نگاه کند ، زیرا ،
آیا می توانم بگویم "من می ترسم"؟ من از غیر جذاب بودن می ترسم. و بنابراین من همیشه از
زمینه جذاب بودن یا جذاب بودن ... KIPP
آیا اینگونه است که شما آن را به خودتان می گویید ، آیا این "شما غیر جذاب هستید" یا چه؟ کلودیا
نه. من نمی خواهم کسی به من نگاه کند زیرا آنها می خواهند متوجه شوند یا قضاوت کنند و تصمیم بگیرند
خواه من از من جذاب باشند یا نه. کله
خوب ، نظر شما چیست؟ آیا شما جذاب هستید؟ کلودیا
خوب ، دیدن اینکه زندگی خالی و بی معنی است ... (خنده) r
کله
خوب تمام خدماتی را که افراد پرداخت کرده اند برای اجازه دادن به او مانند این مشاهده می کنید؟ کلودیا
بنابراین ، من وقتی مردم را جذب می کنم ، مردم را جذب می کنم و وقتی این کار را نمی کنم. کله
بله (تشویق)
کلودیا
و مورد دیگر که برای من در شرکت در من هزینه کرده است ، و آنچه در اینجا متوجه شده ام این است ... وس
توجه کنید که چگونه می توان نشانه ای از همه آنچه را که ناپدید شده است ، توجه کنید: این همه چیز در مورد جذابیت. بیشترین
روابط ... وقتی که بیشتر روابط مانند دو است ، واقعاً می تواند رابطه ای داشته باشد
دستگاه های حافظه رو در رو منتظر یک جکپات همزمان هستید؟ 388

(خنده) r
کلودیا
بنابراین راه دیگری که من شرکت نکردم ، زیرا من غیر جذاب و جذب مردم بودم
گرفتار یک جنبه زن بودن ، زن بودن است که باید بگویم. کله
آیا آنها یکسان نیستند؟ کلودیا
زن برای من علمی تر است. کله
این fi ne است شما باید به من آموزش دهید. من احمق هستم کلودیا
بنابراین من را از لذت بردن از جنبه های خاص زن بودن متوقف کرد. کله
بله ، این بخش مهم است. کلودیا
و اکنون این نوع بسیاری از این تجربیات را از داشتن یک زن جذاب از بین برد. من
فقط می تواند یک زن باشد ، یک فرد باشد ، از آن لذت های ... KIPP لذت ببرید
خوب ، شما نمی خواهید از آن مکالمه برای شرکت در زندگی خود استفاده کنید ، همان چیزی است که من می شنوم. کلودیا
بله کله
خوب ، کلودیا. خیلی ممنون (تشویق)
کله
ببینید ، کجا این واقعاً برای شما مشهود است در مکالمات شما با دیگران است
مردم اگر متوجه شدید ، اگر این مسئله صحیح است ، آن را بیان کنید: بسیاری از مکالمات شما با
افراد دیگر ، این است که شما مردم را به خرید دلایل خود سوق می دهید. آنچه شما دوستان خود می نامید ، خود
دوستان ، افرادی هستند که دلایل شما را خریداری می کنند. بنابراین وقتی آنچه را که می گویید انجام نمی دهید
روز چهارم: جلسه دو
389
انجام دهید ، پس دوستان خود را در آنجا دارید و به سمت آنها می روید و می گویید ، "شما آن چیز را می دانید
گفتم قصد دارم انجام دهم؟ خوب من این کار را نکردم ، اما می دانید چه اتفاقی افتاده است؟ شما می دانید چگونه
مادرم ... و من مشغول بودم ، واقعاً ترسیدم و احساس خوبی نکردم. شما زیر
بایستید ، درست است؟ " و البته کار PAL من - اگر او دوست من ، دوست من است - کار او خرید است
دلایل من چرا؟ بنابراین وقتی او کاری را که او گفت که می خواهد انجام دهد ، انجام نمی دهد ، او علامت خود را به دست می آورد
همه راه اندازی شده است. بنابراین او به من می آید و می گوید: "هی کیپ ، آن چیزی را که من گفتم می خواهم به یاد داشته باشید
انجام دهید؟ خوب من این کار را نکردم زیرا ... "آنچه بسیاری از دوستی های شما براساس آن استوار است ، خرید هر یک است
دلایل دیگر - بسته شدن توطئه های بی اعتمادی. این همان چیزی است که شما به دوستان خود می گویید:
افرادی که تله شما را خریداری می کنند. ببینید ، اگر کسی همراه است و تله های شما را به عقب می چسباند
صورت ، شما اذیت می شوید. این افرادی هستند که می خواهند به نوعی تفاوت ایجاد کنند
در زندگی شما آنهایی که مستقیم با شما هستند. شما افراد زندگی خود را آموزش دیده اید
مستقیم با شما نباشید. شما بهتر است برخی از افراد را در زندگی پیدا کنید تا با شما مستقیم باشند - آنها
خیلی منطقی نخواهند بود وهمی
یکی از مواردی که می توانید در برنامه سمینار روی آن حساب کنید ، مکالماتی است که شما می خواهید
آیا قرار است بسیار غیر منطقی باشد. (تغییر)
بنابراین ، ما در حال انجام یک گفتگوی جدید هستیم که شامل تخریب دلایل و خلقت است
مشارکت من می خواهم که شما به شخص کنار خود بروید و این مکالمه را تمرین کنید. اینقدر
شریک شوید ... شرکت کنندگان خود را به صورت جفت با WES که به آنها کمک می کند ، سازماندهی کردند. وهمی
این چیزی است که شما می خواهید بگویید: "در این بخش از زندگی من شرکت نکردم و اینها هستند
دلایلی که من استفاده کردم. " و در حالی که این حرف را می زنید ، ببینید آیا حاضرید از این دلایل خودداری کنید ،
و اگر هستید ، پس راهی برای گفتن اینکه چگونه می خواهید در آنجا شرکت کنید ، ایجاد کنید. شما در حال ایجاد تعهد برای شرکت هستید. متوجه خواهید شد که حتی نیازی به دادن آن ندارید
دلیل آن شما فقط به نوعی می گویید که می خواهید و با دلایل عدم روبرو هستید. به جای دلایل عدم حضور در زندگی ، احتمال شرکت در زندگی را گوش دهید. چه کسی را انتخاب کنید
اول خواهد رفت آماده؟ شروع. شرکت کنندگان چند دقیقه با یکدیگر به اشتراک گذاشتند. WES به شرکت کنندگان دستور داد تا خوراک
به عقب ، سپس برای تغییر نقش ها. وس سپس فرصتی دیگر به شرکت کنندگان داد تا یک بار دیگر به اشتراک بگذارند
با شرکای خود ، پس از تکرار دستورالعمل ها ، با تأکید بر الزام به وضوح
دلایل عدم شرکت در زندگی را بیان کنید ("چرا شما نباید ، نمی خواهید ، یا نمی توانید ...") ،
و ابراز تمایل به کنار گذاشتن دلایل. وهمی
توقف لطفاً شخصی را که با شما به اشتراک گذاشته است تصدیق کنید. ما مکالمه ای را برای
شرکت در زندگی. یکی از مواردی که ما می خواهیم با آن سر و کار داشته باشیم جایی است که مردم در آنها گیر می کنند
390
وجود
زندگی می کند ، چگونه آنها در زندگی خود گیر می کنند و راهی برای تغییر آن. مکان اساسی که در آن
مردم گیر می کنند در مشکلات خود قرار دارند. شما مشکلاتی را که در زندگی دارید می دانید؟ شما می توانید یک
دستیابی به موفقیت در مورد مشکلات شما. بخش هایی از مکالمه نسبتاً انتزاعی خواهد بود. شما می خواهید از ملاحظات خود در مورد انتزاع خودداری کنید. برای درک آنچه که احتمال شما وجود دارد
LEMS هستند ، به مکانهایی در زندگی خود که در آن گیر کرده اید نگاه کنید. متوجه خواهید شد که این مکان شما است
هرگز در یک میلیون سال امکان پذیر نیست. یک مشکل واقعی در آنجا وجود دارد بدست آوردن
برخی از مشکلات واقعی خود را برای خودتان. برخی از مترادف برای مشکلات چیست؟ نگاه
یک مشکل واقعی در زندگی؟ شرکت کنندگان پاسخ های مختلفی را فریاد زدند: متفاوت ، متوقف شده ، ناراحت ، گیر ، سد ، نگرانی ها ، کافی ،
نگرانی ها ، بار ، دردسر. وهمی
اساساً چه مشکلی است ، چیزی متوقف شده است: چیزی گیر کرده است. راه در
که شما با آن سر و کار دارید این است: یک گیر بودن وجود دارد. حرکت وجود ندارد وقتی تو هستی
در حال حرکت ، شما گیر نمی کنید. ممکن است با چیزی سر و کار داشته باشید. این ممکن است فرقه متفاوتی باشد
اما این به عنوان یک مشکل رخ نمی دهد. مشکلات مکان هایی هستند که شما بی اثر هستید. و شما بی اثر هستید
بدیهی است که به دلیل شرایط ، دلایل ، موقعیت ها و موارد دیگر. اولین چیز به
نگاه کنید به جایی است که مشکلات رخ می دهد. اگر آن را نمی دانید نمی توانید با چیزی کار کنید
مکان بنابراین اگر سعی کنم صندلی را جابجا کنم و فکر می کنم صندلی در اینجا است ... (نشانگر مکانی در مرحله ای است که در آن صندلی وجود ندارد) r
... صندلی منتقل نمی شود. بنابراین ما باید به جایی برسیم که مشکلات رخ می دهد. یک مشکل
به نظر می رسد در جهان رخ می دهد ، اینطور نیست؟ به مشکلات خود فکر کنید: به نوعی مشکل تمام شده است
آنجا و این همان چیزی است که باعث می شود فرقه بسیار متفاوت باشد: این از کنترل شما خارج است. و آنجا
جایی که زندگی می کند بسیار بزرگ است. و اساساً این چیزی است که باعث می شود افراد ناکارآمد شوند
با مشکلات ، زیرا مشکلات در آنجا رخ نمی دهد. به عنوان مشکل ، مشکلی وجود ندارد
آنجا "من سرطان دارم. این در بدن من است." سرطان ممکن است در بدن شما باشد ، اما مشکل
شما با سرطان در بدن شما نیستید. "ماشین من تکه ای است. این یک مشکل واقعی است
برای من. " مشکلی در ماشین شما وجود ندارد.
کودکان به عنوان یک مشکل ، در آنجا نیستند. مشکلات در جهان به عنوان مشکلات رخ نمی دهد. سنگ
مشکلی ندارید ، حتی آنهایی که لگد می زنند و از تپه سقوط می کنند. این مشکلی نیست
برای سنگ ببینید آیا می توانید به کجا مشکلات اشاره کنید. یک شلیک کنید. (نشانگر دهان او)
من نگفتم مشکلی وجود ندارد. مشکلات وجود دارد آنها فقط در آنجا اتفاق نمی افتند. آنها رخ می دهند
اینجا آنها در صحبت کردن و گوش دادن شما هستند. یا با دقت بیشتری ، مشکلات در
گورژ بدون زبان ، مشکلی نیست. خانه مشکلات زبان است. خانه واقعیت ،
برای زندگی برای انسانها ، در زبان زدن است. "مشکلات" وقوع در زبان زدن رخ می دهد. صخره ها صحبت نمی کنند و گوش نمی دهند ، بنابراین مشکلی را که انسان به عنوان مشکل دارد ، ندارند. پائولا
آیا زبان زدن و تمایز یک چیز است؟ در مورد امضای چیست؟ وس (ادامه)
روز چهارم: جلسه دو
391
وهمی
آنها در حال حاضر به اندازه کافی نزدیک هستند. افرادی که امضا می کنند در زبان زایی شرکت می کنند. اینجا چیست
من در زبان نویسی هستم: تصویر ، امضای ، صحبت کردن ، موسیقی: این طیف وسیعی از
فعالیت های انسانی که در آن ارتباط برقرار می شود. ساده ترین چیز برای ما صحبت کردن است
صحبت کردن و گوش دادن پائولا
لمس کردن چطور؟ وهمی
لمس کردن چطور؟ پائولا
برای من ، لمس کردن می تواند برقراری ارتباط باشد. وهمی
می تواند باشد ، و ممکن است نباشد ... پائولا
آیا شما آن را شامل می شوید ...؟ وهمی
... اگر این یک ارتباط عمدی است. پائولا
خوب (نشسته)
وهمی
خوب ، بنابراین مشکلات در زبان زدن رخ می دهد. آیا کسی وجود دارد که نتواند آن را ببیند؟ به اندازه کافی روشن به اندازه کافی نزدیک ... برای کار دولت. (خنده) r
داود
من واقعاً روشن نیستم که مشکل در زبان زدن است. وهمی
بله کجاست؟ مشکلی به من دادی؟ داود
کاملاً در پروژه هایی که انجام می دهم شرکت می کنم. هیجان زده از پروژه ها. 392
وجود
وهمی
دو چیز در آنجا وجود دارد: کاملاً شرکت کننده و هیجان زده. داود
واقعاً از پروژه هایی که در آن شرکت می کنم بسیار هیجان زده می شوم. وس
"من پروژه ها را انجام می دهم. من هیجان زده نیستم. این یک مشکل برای من است." آیا اینگونه است؟ داود
بله وهمی
آنجا را می بینید؟ داود
بله وهمی
این جایی است که مشکل است. داود
ممنون وهمی
خوش آمدید (خنده ؛ دیوید نشسته)
بنابراین اکنون که آن را در دامنه زبان قرار داده ایم ، به آنها دسترسی داریم. اگر می توانید
مشکلات را در جایی که هستند ، پیدا کنید ، یعنی در زبان نویسی ، اکنون دسترسی به معامله دارید
با مشکلاتی که امکان دستیابی به موفقیت در مشکلات را فراهم می کند. ما اکنون می خواهیم با
دستیابی به موفقیت واقعی در مشکلات. این همان چیزی است که همه شما باید بدست آورید ، مورد بعدی است که من با آن سر و کار دارم. من
با کمی بیشتر برخورد کنید ، اما این همان است. شما می خواهید جعبه خاص را از بین ببرید ... من می خواهم شما تصور کنید:
زبانها جعبه های زیادی دارد. باور کنید: بسیاری از جعبه ها در زبان زدن ؛ بسیاری از امکانات برای
چیزهایی که باید در درون زبان رخ دهند. ما می خواهیم جعبه مشخصی را که مشکلات در آن ایجاد می شود ، از بین ببریم. مشکلات فقط در یک جعبه رخ می دهد. به عنوان یک جعبه ظاهر نمی شود ، زیرا مردم
فکر کنید مشکلات آنها "در آنجا" است ، مانند "آنجا" ظاهر می شود. اما اکنون که می دانید که
در یک جعبه به زبان زبانی نشان می دهیم ، ما باید جعبه را از بین ببریم. دانستن جعبه به ما برخی می دهد
قدرت با توجه به مشکلات ما. در واقع همه چیز را باز می کند. وس به تخته گچ حرکت کرد ، یک مربع را کشید و "مشکلات" را در داخل آن نوشت. روز چهارم: جلسه دو
393
بنابراین ، در اینجا مشکلات وجود دارد. هر مشکلی که به وجود آوردید در اینجا اتفاق می افتد ، در زبان زدن. اسم چیست
از جعبه ای که مشکلات وارد می شود؟ شرکت کننده
اعلامیه وهمی
نه. در نهایت ، بله ، خوب؟ اما شما برای ما کمی پیشرفت کرده اید. من می خواهم مشخصات C را بدانم
نوع اعلامیه ای که مشکلات در آن رخ می دهد. (با مراجعه به شرکت کنندگان با برچسب های نام زرد ، که در آنجا برای اولین بار در این زمینه شرکت می کنند)
من می خواهم برخی از زردها برای پاسخ به این. من نمی خواهم کسی این را "به یاد بیاورد". یک شرکت کننده به نام پاول ایستاد ، شرکت کننده ای که مانند جیک "پای خود را به سمت زمین میخکوب کرده بود"
در مورد عدم اطمینان در گفتگو با Erhard در جلسه دو روز اول. پولک
شما در مورد مشکل بودن صحبت کردید. ما قبلاً در مورد این که مانعی است صحبت کردیم. آنچه در ابتدا رخ می دهد
برای من به عنوان نام جعبه ای که مشکلات وارد می شود جعبه مشکل است. وهمی
نه ، خوب ، بله ، اما مفید نیست. پولک
اما مشکل واقعاً این است که مشکل چیست و مشکل در تلاش برای برچسب زدن آن است. من
فکر می کنم این یک مانع است و همه چیزهای دیگر که مردم می گویند این است. وهمی
این جعبه ای نیست که خود را به شما نشان دهد. شما به یاد دارید که ما آن بحث را انجام دادیم؟ شما آن را به یاد دارید
"تعامل خطر"؟ کاری که دیروز انجام دادیم؟ پولک
چگونه می توانم فراموش کنم؟ وهمی
به یاد داشته باشید ، ما چیزهای زیادی داشتیم که روی تخته بروند. سپس این احتمال را پیشنهاد کردم که وجود داشته باشد
قاب در اطراف همه آن ، که همه آن تغییرات ، مانند یک الگوی رفتاری ، "زندگی برای آن خطرناک است
انسان. " ما به دنبال بیانیه ای مانند آن هستیم.
شما مشکل هستید شما مشکل می شوید. در آن چارچوب که ... 394 است
وجود
وهمی
بله خوب این چگونه مشکلات رخ نمی دهد. مشکلات برای مردم رخ نمی دهد "من مشکل هستم."
پولک
خوب وهمی
وقتی ماشین من شکسته شد ، ماشین مشکل است. و راهی وجود دارد که مکالمه من رخ می دهد ، من
رابطه با همه اینها پولک
خوب وهمی
شما فقط می توانید به دنبال نگاه باشید. شما آن را خوب شروع کردید. پولک
ام ، بنابراین شما می گویید که جعبه ای که در آن مشکل رخ می دهد نام آن را دارد ... wes
بیانیه ای که در آن رخ می دهد نام خاصی به آن دارد. گفتگو در "HU-
مرد بودن. " این همیشه مکالمه است.
زبان ، زندگی ، واقعیت و مشکلات شما را به شما می دهد: هنگامی که مشکلی پیش می آید ، وجود دارد
همیشه همیشه برای شما اتفاق می افتد. این جعبه است: همیشه راه همیشه برای شما اتفاق می افتد. شما هیچ ارتباطی با آن ندارید. شما آن را انتخاب نکردید ... پل
این طوفان باران است. وهمی
این طوفان باران است. ما می خواهیم از آنچه که همیشه برای شما اتفاق می افتد حس کنیم. این یکی است
از آن "خیلی ساده برای ذهن پیچیده ..."
پل (می خندد)
خوب ، پس شاید مشکل راکت شما باشد. وهمی
نه ، این یک توضیح در مورد آن است. ما به دنبال بیانیه هستیم. پولک
جمله ای که حاوی مشکل است ...
