Forum Day Four: Session Three 493
slow, baseballs. Guys like you and me who play baseball once at the company picnic, we play
with very small, supersonic bullets...
(laughter)
...and our behavior is correlated to uncatchable balls. See you were not a creep when you were
sweeping up and missed those spots. The fl oor occurred as clean for you. And you stopped
when it did, like anybody would, like your father would. The fl oor occurred as not clean for
your father. Therefore, for your father you should have kept sweeping.
MIKE
So I could have caught that ball if I saw it big, and slow, over there?
ERHARD
Let me ask you a question. Forget that you can‚Äôt reach it because there are people around you. If
I threw the ball over there...
(throwing the ball)
...could you catch it?
MIKE
There‚Äôs a possibility.
After receiving the ball back from another participant, Erhard threw the ball farther away from
Mike.
ERHARD
If I threw it there could you catch it?
MIKE
No.
ERHARD
Who said so?
MIKE
I said so.
ERHARD
Because the ball occurs for you as uncatchable.
MIKE
So if it would occur for me as catchable I could catch it.
This revealing gathers together in advance
the aspect and the matter of ship or house,
with a view to the finished thing envisioned as
completed, and from this gathering determines
the manner of its construction. Thus what is
decisive in techne does not at all lie in making
and manipulating, nor in the using of means,
but rather in the revealing. . . . It is as reveal-
ing, and not as manufacturing, that techne is a
bringing-forth. [. . .] Technology is a mode of
revealing. Technology comes to presence in the
realm where revealing and unconcealment take
place, where aletheia, truth, happens.
(‚ÄúQCT‚Äù in BW 319)
‚Äú
For Heidegger, what is fundamental in techne, and therefore in
technology, is not the tools and instruments it manifests, but
that it is a way of disclosing entities as entities. Here we find
a harmonic with Erhard‚Äôs technology of transformation as the
process of distinguishing distinctions, the distinguishing of which,
entirely in language, discloses worlds within which human beings
have access to acting on and fulfilling new possibilities for Being-
in-the-world beyond what is already and always given for human
beings to be: the in-order-to‚Äîthe techne‚Äîof our technological age.
Techne as the in-order-to discloses entities as raw material and
resources that can then be used up to enhance power and security,
and a correlative way of Being is brought forth in that disclosure,
in that manifestation of the tools and instruments techne calls for,
a technological way of Being that on Heidegger‚Äôs view poses great
danger to us.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
There would be the possibility of catching it and your actions would be consistent with catching
it. Let me ask you a question: Have you ever seen a great athletic feat?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
If you don‚Äôt move, you don‚Äôt catch. Did you hear what I said?
MIKE
If you don‚Äôt move, you don‚Äôt catch.
ERHARD
Yeah. So. Guys who move have the possibility of catching. And you see them do things you
thought were impossible. You get that now? Is that clear? You don‚Äôt move, you don‚Äôt catch. And
you only move when the ball occurs as catchable. These are not guys calling for superhuman
eff ort from themselves. These are guys who because of certain ways they are trained see a ball
as catchable like a possibility, which you don‚Äôt see. You don‚Äôt catch the ball every time I throw it
right there, do you?
MIKE
No, not every time.
ERHARD
Exactly, but you don‚Äôt move to catch the ball every time, when I throw it there.
MIKE
Right. The occurring.
ERHARD
Got it?
MIKE
The occurring I don‚Äôt understand.
ERHARD
How fast was that ball moving?
MIKE
Feet per minute?
ERHARD
You have no idea, right?
