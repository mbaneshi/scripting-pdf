SPEAKING BEING
TONY
It will end that way.
ERHARD
It will. And you want to know what? You’ll be just like you are, whether or not you have God in 
your life. I didn’t say there was something wrong with having God in your life. I didn’t say there 
was something right with it. You want to turn this “God in my life” stuff  into another fucking 
racket. You do. You don’t like that idea. 
TONY
If you have the concept of God you have to believe that there’s a better place.
ERHARD
Who said that? The Pope?
TONY
Who the fuck is the Pope?
ERHARD
It’s just you talking. I didn’t say it wasn’t true. I just don’t want you to turn this into another 
fucking racket. God is not going to save your ass. Your ass is going into a hole. 
TONY
It’s already gone. Great. So if I have God in my life I have God in my life, if I don’t I don’t.
ERHARD
Exactly. That’s the fucking truth isn’t it?
TONY
That is the truth.
ERHARD
Right. You want to make some bullshit out of that. 
TONY
Everybody does.
ERHARD
You want to make that mean something. I know everybody does, that’s why I got a job.
(applause)
TONY
Yeah, well, I want your job.
