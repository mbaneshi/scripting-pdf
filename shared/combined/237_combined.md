Forum Day Three: Session Three 223
ERHARD
Yeah.
BETH
That I don’t take risks.
ERHARD
So what?
BETH
So what? I know...
ERHARD
I asked you fi rst. So what “you avoid risks”?
BETH
Yeah.
ERHARD
You avoid risks. You made that into some kind of crummy meaning. You know what? You
avoid risks. Okay. You turned it into a soap opera. You made it mean something. You put
violins in the back, and turned it into some meaning. What does it mean that you avoid risks?
It doesn’t mean anything. Rocks are hard. You know what that means? Nothing. They’re just
hard. You avoid risks. What does that mean? Nothing. I’m getting older. What does that mean?
Nothing. I didn’t succeed in life. What does that mean? Nothing. I had a divorce. What does
that mean? Nothing... but I had two divorces. What does that mean? Two nothings. But I’m
not worthy. So what you’re not worthy? You’re going to make a federal case out of it? You’re
not worthy. I got that. Now what? You want to make something out of it. It does not mean
anything! It’s meaningless. Does it mean something that rocks are hard? What about the
spirits-in the-rocks shit? More fucking voodoo.
(laughter)
Voodoo! You avoid risks. I got it. “Oh, but you don’t understand.” What you mean is, I don’t
get all the meaning and drama and turmoil and soap opera and the sadness and upset. You’re
right. I don’t get that. That’s your crap. What I get is that you avoid intimacy. I got that. Rocks
are hard. Water’s wet. And you avoid intimacy. And each one of those has an equal amount of
signifi cance. But you made a big deal out of avoiding intimacy. Turned it into a whole fucking
soap opera. You know, it’s back and forth. Sometimes Beth resists that and tries to be intimate.
And sometimes she succumbs to it and gives up the attempt to be intimate. She changes so that
she’s more intimate. Is that getting clearer?
BETH
Yeah. I’m going to take a risk.
224
SPEAKING BEING
BETH (to the group)
All available men: see me at the break.
ERHARD
Very good trolling. Have them line up.
(to the group)
There was a little something you didn’t get out of that.
Erhard held up his hands and stuck one index fi nger into the circled fi ngers of the other hand,
making a gesture indicating the sex act.
ERHARD
This is very signifi cant. God and that.
Erhard looked over at Angel, the participant who had shared the day before about being twice-
divorced.
ERHARD
What are you doing over there, Angel?
ANGEL (angrily)
What do you mean nothing means anything?
ERHARD (to Angel)
I didn’t say “nothing means anything.”
(making the sex-act gesture)
I said this... means this. Stand up.
(to the group)
How would you like to carry around what she carries around?
ANGEL
You gave me something yesterday, and you just now took it away.
ERHARD
And you turned it into shit when I gave to you. And I didn’t give it to you anyhow; you gave it
to your self, but then you turned it into shit, because you made it mean something, and now
you’ve got a new soap opera. The old soap opera was “I was divorced twice.” Now you got a new
soap opera. Can you not see that you’re stuck and you have a conversation with Kipp and me to
get unstuck? Then we bring up some new thing and then you get stuck again. You’re a series of
stucks, one after the other after the other after the other, making up stucks. Tell us your story
here. What is it that’s bothering you? Tell Kipp.
Forum Day Three: Session Three 225
ANGEL
Nothing.
ERHARD
Oh bullshit.
KIPP
Try again. Stand up.
ERHARD
You’re a long way from nothing. When he’s done...
ANGEL (angrily)
So what?
ERHARD
When he’s done with you, you may get to nothing. Right now you’re something.
ANGEL
Why is it important for me to be nothing?
KIPP
Well, how is something treating you right now?
ANGEL
I don’t know how to be nothing.
ERHARD (interrupting Kipp to address the group)
What you’re watching, what this is designed to do, is to let you look down to the very
foundation of what the already always being of human beings is. You’re going to get to see
whence you came. In this conversation—it’s gonna take hours, and given how stupid you are,
it’s gonna take a lot of hours—and what you’re going to see if you’re watching, is whence you
came. I mean you. What a “you” is, what an “I” is, what a “me” is. This is whence it comes.
Remember what I said earlier about working backwards? We’re going to get all the way
down to the bottom, to the source of you. And this is the conversation in which we’re going to
do it. And if you watch here, and map this on to your own life, you’ll get to see where you
came from.
(pausing)
This is where you came from. You didn’t come from your mother. You got your body from your
mother. This is where you came from. Remember I told you the fi rst half of The Forum was
the already always being of human being? This is you “already always.” She sat down yesterday
beautifully unstuck. Now she’s as stuck as she was yesterday. By the time we fi nish this
conversation most of you will be unstuck. And by tomorrow you will be stuck again. Because
What you’re watching, what this is designed to
do, is to let you look down to the very founda-
tion of what the already always being of human
beings is.
“
226
SPEAKING BEING
that’s what it is to be human. To be stuck. You don’t like it, too bad. Stay in California. Then you
can play stuck trying to get unstuck. You understand stuck trying to get unstuck?
(very loudly)
You are stuck trying to get unstuck, you asshole!
KIPP
So Angel, what did you give meaning to?
ANGEL
Life.
KIPP
No. You were going along fi ne, right?
ANGEL
I was going along great.
KIPP
That’s right, you were going along great.
ERHARD
And you made going along great mean something, didn’t you?
ANGEL
Yes.
ERHARD
Yeah, you turned it into a fucking soap opera. You want to get that, you want to get that real
clear because you’re going to do the same thing. You will do it. I’m not telling you about it so
that you won’t do it. That’ll make a fool out of me. ‘Cause you will do it. Remember I said “ride
the horse in the direction it’s going”? I walk out to the street and watch for which way the traffi  c
is going. I point in the direction it’s going. Someone says, “Jesus, that guy makes the traffi  c go
in that direction. Look at that guy! He makes everything go the way he makes it go.” I’m just
telling you so that I’m pointing in the direction you’re going anyhow. No sense pointing in the
other direction. That’s stupid.
KIPP
So, you made what mean something?
ANGEL
That I don’t care.
The Violence of Meaning
Human beings are the animals with language. As a result, we
awake daily into a meaningful understanding of the world. We
assign meaning to everything that exists and everything that
occurs; we are compelled to know what things mean, and cannot
stand not to know.
To understand the depth of our attachment to meaning,
consider Martin Heidegger’s view: language was not a property
that was somehow granted to human beings; it was only through
language that human beings became human beings. The impulse
to mean and know is constitutive of our being. It is so much the
way we are that we cannot recognize its downside, which is that
our death-grip on meaning is the source of most of our problems.
So in any deep exploration of human being, such as that
conducted in The Forum, it is essential to consider the function
of meaning, as well as the process by which meanings emerge in
the world, and are—or are not—maintained there. How did the
world occur; how did human beings occur? In the writing of the
pre-Socratic Greek philosophers, Heidegger finds this perspective:
the beings currently in the world are there because human beings
spoke them into being. Further, in doing so, we were at the same
time creating ourselves as human beings.
ERHARD (continuing)
Forum Day Three: Session Three 227
KIPP
Yesterday you saw something about not caring.
ANGEL
I saw that it was okay to care sometimes and sometimes I don’t.
KIPP
Right.
ANGEL
It’s not okay to have life mean something sometimes and for sometimes life not to mean
anything.
ERHARD
It never means anything. It doesn’t mean something sometimes and not mean something at
other times. Life is empty and meaningless.
ANGEL
Then why should I be alive? Then I shouldn’t be alive. Dead.
KIPP
Then you would be dead.
ERHARD
You know what you just did? I said life is empty and meaningless and you made that mean
something. I said life was empty and meaningless and you got sad about it. “Really? Ohh. We’ll
maybe I’ll just lie down now and watch television.”
ANGEL
And so just because you say life is meaningless I should believe it?
ERHARD
I didn’t say to believe anything. Didn’t I tell you up front not to believe anything I say?
ANGEL
Yes, I forgot.
ERHARD
The truth speaks for itself, it does not need me. At any rate, when I said “empty and
meaningless,” you said, “oh my God, oh that’s terrible.” You made empty and meaningless
mean something. You’re a drama queen.
ANGEL (vehemently)
Yes, I am.
Man, insofar as he exists as man, has always
already spoken out about physis [Being],
about the prevailing whole to which he himself
belongs. Man has done so not only through
the fact and for the purpose of talking specifi-
cally about things; for to exist as man already
means: to make whatever prevails come to be
spoken out. (FCM 26, emphasis added)
“
In order to be spoken about, beings must be spoken out. For the
Greeks, “speaking is called legein; the prevailing that has been
spoken out is the logos” (FCM 26). But Heidegger suggests a more
original meaning for both words: legein, in its original meaning, was
not to speak, but to gather and collect, or to lay out; Logos, as what
is gathered and laid before us, was the primary gathering principle.
This “original” meaning of logos, then, draws our attention to
whatever is there before it is articulated—before the emergence
of judgment, the assertion of opinion, and the contradiction of
perspectives. These are all of course inevitable. But the writing
of the pre-Socratics suggests to Heidegger that at the dawn of
humanity, something was available to human apprehension, a
logos, which now escapes us.
For Heraclitus, it was the logos, the background of collected-
ness, the sway in the event of its emergence into the world. The
meaninglessness from which beings emerge cannot maintain
itself in a world of meaning, but for a moment in history, for those
who were open to its emergence, it was glimpsed. Heraclitus
suggests that it remains available, but that human beings as a
whole—the hoi polloi—are unavailable for glimpsing it.
But while logos constantly remains itself,
human beings behave as those who do not
comprehend (axunetoi), both before they have
heard and aft er they have heard. . . . Hence one
must follow the Together in beings—that is,
adhere to it; but whereas logos essentially un-
folds as this Together in beings, the mass lives
as if each had his own understanding (sense).
(Heraclitus, fragments 1–2, in IM 140–141)
“
228
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
All right. And proud of it.
ANGEL
And sometimes I’m not.
ERHARD
Where is the chip queen? I’m going to get you two together. You can have a meeting. That
would be great. Talk about movies. That’s real entertainment: the drama queen and the chip
queen together. Angel, do you understand that I’m not trying to make you not be the way you
are? I’m simply trying to shed some light where you stand. I don’t want you to not be the way
you are. I know you’re a drama queen. You’re always going to be into the drama. And I didn’t
say that’s bad. But you want to make everything mean something. You screw yourself over every
time because you make it mean something.
ANGEL
Isn’t it human to make everything mean something?
ERHARD
That’s what I said. We were going to reveal the already always nature of being for human beings.
ANGEL
So what I got was that I am a human being and I can’t get away from being a human being. And
I spent a lot of time and eff ort trying not to be a human being.
ERHARD
Very good, but now you’ve turned that into a sacred cow. You’ve turned being a human being
into a sacred cow. “Now the son of a bitch wants to take away my new sacred cow from me.”
ANGEL
And my new sacred cow is being a human being.
ERHARD
Yeah, you turned that into some kind of a story. Instead of just being a human being you turned
that into a soap opera, a drama. Life doesn’t mean anything, sweatheart. It doesn’t mean a thing.
ANGEL
You don’t know how upset that makes me.
ERHARD
I understand that it makes you upset. I told you, this is my second Forum. I told you when I
found that out I was real upset.
ANGEL
But then what did you do with it?
Heidegger develops this distinction further:
Heraclitus wants to say: human beings do hear,
and they hear words, but in this hearing they
cannot “hearken” to, that is, follow, what is
not audible like words, what is not talk but
logos. . . . But genuine hearkening has nothing
to do with the ear and the glib tongue, but
instead means obediently following what logos
is: the gatheredness of beings themselves.
(IM 142–143)
“
Logos, Being, the Together in beings, is the unspoken background
that emerges to be glimpsed in the dialogue of The Forum.
If we are listening for the logos, we may hear the gathering in
Heidegger’s words of one of his most important and provocative
hints: his persistent play at the fuzzy boundary between Being
and beings. By teasing out, over a fift y-year career, the question
of agency in the Being–being relation, Heidegger provided human
thinking with an essentially reflexive quandary, one whose
thinking through may catapult us into a leap and land us with a
more liberated understanding of the world.
Heidegger’s early take on this question, in Being and Time,
was that Dasein achieves an authentic existence through the
achievement of resoluteness, and the existential choices thereby
made available. One of those choices is to stop fleeing one’s reality
and let it be, recognizing that its meanings are made up and
malleable: “When Dasein is resolute, it takes over authentically
in its existence the fact that it is the null basis of its own nullity”
(BT 354). In The Forum, this authentic taking-over of existence
is made possible by the distinction of nullity (life is empty and
meaningless), and of oneself as the null basis of that nullity (it’s
empty and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless).
In his later rubrics, releasement and appropriation, Heidegger
moved toward the more receptive side of the Being–being balance,
bringing letting and allowing forward as moments in the attainment
of authenticity. But the clearing opened through all of these
articulations is the Same, emerging in the unspoken reverberations
as the distinction is teased out. “Hints,” said Heidegger, “need the
widest sphere in which to swing” (“DL” in OWL 27). ■
Forum Day Three: Session Three 229
ERHARD
I got over being upset. It not only doesn’t mean anything...
(pausing)
Listen. Life is not only empty and meaningless, but it is empty and meaningless that it is empty
and meaningless. See, some asshole in here is going to say, “Well, if it’s empty and meaningless
then I’m going home.”
(loudly)
No! You made it mean something! You didn’t get it. It’s empty and meaningless and it’s empty
and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless. Life’s not going anywhere. It’s like this. You
don’t like this? Too bad. This is the way it is. Just like this, and that, and that. Tomorrow will be
like it is tomorrow, and the day after will be like it is the day after tomorrow. And a year from
now will be like it is a year from now: like it is today. A lot of you are hearing me insulting
your practice. You know, insulting your practice, let’s call it, your relationship with God, your
meditation, whatever it is. I’m not insulting your practice. I’m insulting practicing in-order-to.
You practice when you practice. Shut up. Just practice. It’s not going to get you anywhere. If
you’re practicing in order to get somewhere, stop it because you’re wasting your time. You’re
not going to get anywhere. You’re always going to be right where you are. If you practice long
enough, you’ll fi nd that out. Talk to Kipp some more, you’re doing a good job.
KIPP
Now what?
ANGEL
That’s a very good question.
ERHARD
Very good...
ANGEL
I like the fact that...
ERHARD
Remember when I said that you thought your fi re would go out if you didn’t have this drama?
ANGEL
Right.
ERHARD
Yes.
ANGEL
But I got fi re from the possibility of having an empty canvas.
230
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
I know. You turned that into another fi re: drama, meaning, signifi cance. You take everything
and turn it into shit. We create something called possibility and you turn it into some kind of
fucking golden calf. Like “oh! That’s going to save me. Man, am I glad I got here! I didn’t know
that was the answer.” The answer is that there isn’t any answer. That’s the answer. No kidding.
Like really. You can go anywhere in the universe you want to go to get the answer. And that’s
the answer. Whatever it is you’re doing to make it, you’re never going to do that enough to make
it. It isn’t going to turn out because it already turned out. And this is the way it turned out. Just
like this. Tomorrow will be just like it is tomorrow. And when you die, they’ll put you into a box
and throw dirt on your face. And that’s how it’ll all turn out. It doesn’t mean anything.
ANGEL
So now that I know that, why not throw dirt in my face right now?
ERHARD
That’s making it mean something. And it’s high drama meaning. You could have said, “I’ll go
watch television.” You could have said that but it’s not dramatic enough. There are people in
here that are not high dramatists like you are. Some people say “I’ll go home and watch the
game.” Yours is “I’ll kill myself.” It’s just a matter of style. You watch. The world’s going to
change here. It’s going to stop being the way it is.
KIPP
What now? Can you see how attached you are to having it mean something?
ANGEL
Yes. Yesterday I was attached to caring which meant it means something.
KIPP
Yeah, and so what you’re attached to is being attached.
ERHARD
That’s a little advanced for most of you.
ANGEL
So, if I’m not attached to it anymore, it doesn’t mean it’s not still there. It just means I’m not
attached to it anymore.
ERHARD
No. That’s some kind of Zen horseshit. You are not attached to it. You’re not attached to it, and
that’s the end of that story.
ANGEL
If I’m not resisting it, then I’m not attached to it anymore.
Speaking out
Another aspect of this perspective: in speaking out, we are
“outing” something that has already existed, in the background,
as a possibility. Indeed: “If we conceive of this state of aff airs in an
elementary and originary way, we see that what is spoken out is
already necessarily within physis, otherwise it could not be spoken
from out of it” (FCM 26). Heidegger presses the point: everything
that exists has been spoken out, and everything that has been
spoken out was already there. So:
The question for us is: What does this legein,
this speaking out accomplish? What occurs in
the logos? Is it only a matter of the fact that
what beings as a whole are is brought to a
word, formulated, come to word? To come to
word—what does that mean? (FCM 26–27)
“
To understand the meaning of a term or concept, says Heidegger,
it may be useful to consider its opposite. He finds in a fragment of
Heraclitus the suggestion that the opposite of legein—that is, “not
letting come to word”—was for the Greeks precisely understood as
concealment:
From this it necessarily follows that the funda-
mental function of legein is to take whatever
prevails from concealment. . . . Revealing, ‘tak-
ing from concealment,’ is that happening which
occurs in the logos. In the logos, the prevailing
of beings becomes revealed, becomes mani-
fest. (FCM 27)
“
Forum Day Three: Session Three 231
This, then, is what is happening in our speaking out: we speak out
from concealment; we unconceal a world of beings. How fortunate we
are that we have the ability to create meanings, and can thereby live in
a world of culture and technology, and reap their benefits.
But there is of course a qualifier to the promise in this
situation, which Heidegger finds elsewhere in Heraclitus’ writing:
ERHARD
Zen bullshit.
ANGEL
I’m from California.
ERHARD
That’s right. What was the last thing you said Kipp?
KIPP
You’re attached to being attached.
ERHARD (indicating Angel)
It was you. An emerging bit of light here. Attached to meaning. That’s what it was. He said you
were attached to meaning, and you said yesterday I was attached to caring and that made it
mean something. And today I’ve gotten down an even more fundamental level, “I’m attached
to meaning.”
ANGEL
Yeah.
ERHARD
Yeah. You are attached to meaning. That’s what there is to get. You are stuck with meaning.
You have no freedom. Everything’s got to be made to mean something. Everything’s got to be
made signifi cant. That’s the drama queen.
ANGEL
I don’t see what’s left.
ERHARD
So I’m gonna tell you. You want to know what’s left? Nothing. What’s left is nothing. I told you
we were going to work our way back to zero. This is zero.
ANGEL
I can’t be with zero.
ERHARD
I know. I told you it made me real sad. It’s not going to be all right. It’s going to be the way it is.
What there is to be with is that life is empty and meaningless. That’s what there is to be with. It
is not going to turn out. It is not going to be all right. It’s going to be whatever fucking way it is.
However it is.
ANGEL
No matter what I do?
Being loves to hide. Why this is so is a question for which Heidegger
does not specify an answer, since the question must be left  open.
In the swinging of that open question, thinking may distinguish
new paths into Being. For example, if The Forum is a conversation
for the emergence of Being, and if Being strives to conceal itself,
then interesting implications emerge about the nature of The
Forum experience, which we continue to explore and unfold in
these sidebars and intervals. ■
[I]f prevailing is torn from concealment in the
logos, then it must, as it were, try to conceal
itself. The very same Heraclitus tells us in
addition . . . why physis came to be revealed
and torn from concealment explicitly in legein.
In the collection of fragments one sentence
stands alone which to this day has never been
understood or comprehended in its profundity:
“The prevailing of things has in itself a striving
to conceal itself.” (FCM 27, emphasis added)
“
232
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Yeah, but see, there’s something a little off  in that, because you’re only going to do what you’re
going to do. People don’t do what they want to do; they do what they do. You always do what
you do. And you don’t always do what you want to do, do you? The only time you do what you
wanted to do is when it’s coincidentally what you did. You aren’t doing what you wanted to
do; you’re doing what you do. And you got this God damned story about wants. People don’t
do what they want to do; they do what they do, always and only. “Want to” is a story. Like
explaining illness with evil spirits. Voodoo. The stars will not move for what you want. You do
what you do, and you don’t do what you don’t do. And all the rest of it is some cockeyed story
that destroys the simplicity, the power, the sweetness of the way it is. Look, did you ever notice
you are never ever fucking satisfi ed? Ever! It doesn’t make any diff erence how good it is. It never
makes a diff erence what you achieve. Ever. Ever! You just can’t get that this is it. Kipp, tell them
about the practice life. Do your thing about the playing cards.
KIPP
The playing cards of life...
Kipp held up a pad of paper—as if they were cards—up to his chest.
KIPP
What it is to be a human being is to hold on to your aces. Because you know, that one time in
life when you gave away everything...
ERHARD
When you were a kid one time, you gave away your aces and you got smashed... Every one of
you. And from then on, you became “I don’t play my aces.” It wasn’t a decision merely or a
thought merely, from then on you became “I don’t play my aces.”
KIPP
You became what is known as a smart person. What a smart person looks like is a person who
walks around holding their aces. Then along came Einstein, and Einstein said the problems that
we got are not going to be solved with the way that we think we got into those problems...
ERHARD (interrupting Kipp)
Hold on, don’t fuck that quote up.
KIPP
You fuck it up.
(laughter)
ERHARD
The problems we have are not going to be solved at the level in which we created them. What
does that mean? It’s real simple. You got someplace in life. People have gotten someplace in
People don’t do what they want to do; they do
what they do. You always do what you do. And
you don’t always do what you want to do, do
you? The only time you do what you wanted to
do is when it’s coincidentally what you did.
“
Forum Day Three: Session Three 233
life. What got you there gives you the problems you got. It’s not that you fucked something
up on the way. It’s that you succeeded. If you use what you got to get where you are, it
produces success and a certain set of problems. You cannot solve those problems with that
with which you succeeded, because those problems are a product of that which you used
to succeed. Did you get that? Those problems are a product of getting here, and you can’t
solve those problems with what got you here. Because what got you here, got you here and
gave you those problems. You can’t solve the problems you have at the level at which you
generated the problems.
KIPP
So what’s required is a new level of thinking. Here’s what that looks like: You want all my aces?
Here!
Kipp threw forward the pieces of paper representing his aces.
KIPP
But you can’t do that because if you did, you’d get used by life.
ERHARD
He’s a little too funny. And you don’t get it. You fucking assholes! You held on to your aces so
you wouldn’t get used. You’re going to go to your grave holding your aces.
Kipp continued the bit, very fl amboyantly demonstrating not giving aces away to this wife, this job,
etc.
KIPP
See, I wasn’t going to give my aces to my wife Christine, because she wasn’t the one. You
know what the one looks like. Tall, blonde, always rides the horse and never wears clothes. So
anytime I would be at a party with Christine, I wouldn’t stand too close to her in case the one
came riding in on the horse, I could just jump on and ride off  into the distance. How about that
job? You’re not going to give your aces to that job, that’s just the practice job. What about your
body? The question is: What is going to be written on your gravestone?
ERHARD
You get the point. This is not your real life. You’re living your practice life. Nobody would
be stupid enough to take their real life and do what you’ve done with it. Suppose you were
married to your real wife–I mean like the real one. Man, you would give everything to her.
Everything you’ve got. But the one you’re married to now is your “practice wife.” Here’s how
you can tell. If she were the one, the woman of your dreams, you wouldn’t be like you are
with her, and you know it. The same with your job. You don’t give everything you’ve got to
this job. This is just a practice job. You keep your aces for when the real one comes along.
That’s when you’ll spend your life on your life, when the real one comes along, but not on
this life.
If you use what you got to get where you are, it
produces success and a certain set of problems.
You cannot solve those problems with that with
which you succeeded, because those problems
are a product of that which you used to succeed.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (walking across the room, speaking softly)
There’s no real one. This is it. It’s not going to get any better. It’s not going to work out. The
right one is not going to come along. The right job isn’t going to come along. This is the only
job there is, this is the only wife there is, this is the only life there is. This is not practice. You’re
bullshitting yourself. This is the game, and you’re playing like you’re in practice. You want to get
that this is the game. The right circumstances in which to be happy are not going to come along.
They’re not. You’re waiting for it to turn out. Life is not going to work out. And someday it’s not
going to be all better. Today is the way it is today and someday is the way someday is going to be.
And in between it’s going to be the way it is in between. And the ultimate beyond that will be
the way it is there.
(speaking forcefully, while walking among the group)
This is not a practice life. Whatever you’ve got when you die, you’re going to die with it. And you
are going to die with your aces. You thought “asshole” was insulting. It’s starting to make sense,
isn’t it? It was a bit of a compliment, wasn’t it?
(laughter)
A participant named Jacob stood and took a microphone.
JACOB
Angel seems to be very concerned about the notion that nothing means anything.
ERHARD
No no. Nobody said “nothing means anything.”
JACOB
Well, at any rate...
ERHARD
It means what it means.
JACOB
Well, at any rate...
ERHARD
A bowl is a bowl.
JACOB
Yeah.
ERHARD
It’s not nothing. It’s a bowl.
The right circumstances in which to be happy
are not going to come along. They’re not. You’re
waiting for it to turn out. Life is not going to
work out. And someday it’s not going to be all
better. Today is the way it is today and some-
day is the way someday is going to be. And in
between it’s going to be the way it is in between.
And the ultimate beyond that will be the way it
is there.

Forum Day Three: Session Three 235
JACOB
I was just thinking if you take the phrase “nothing means anything” in a positive way. The
words are interchangeable. The word nothing means anything; anything is nothing. That
might be the kind of hippy defi nition you don’t like.
ERHARD
True.
JACOB
I know, I know. I don’t like it either, but...
ERHARD
I’ll tell you what I do like, though, is I like that you’re engaged in the conversation. What I
don’t like is being facile about it. Do you know what I mean by the word facile? Live easy with
it.
JACOB
Yeah.
ERHARD
You’ve got to be ballsy with it. You’ve got to get down with this. This is not some airy fairy crap.
I didn’t say you’ve got to talk bad like I do. You’ve got to get down in your own way, but you’ve
got to get down. You’ve got to get out of that “whoooo” shit.
KIPP
And you’ve made it into that. Do you know that?
JACOB
Yeah. What I wanted to say a couple of days ago about doing what you can or can’t do, I think
it was Benjamin Franklin who said...
(forgetting)
ERHARD
I know what they said too, but I can never seem to remember it. We’ll read you that Einstein
quote we butchered later.
(laughter)
JACOB
I remember now. He had a good defi nition of the word character. To have character is to follow
through with the decision after the emotion of making that decision has passed. I thought
that’s what Werner was saying about being facile.
236
SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
What he’s saying is that the way you’re listening to what’s happening in the room is like a
concept. You’re doing the same thing Angel’s doing, just a diff erent meaning. Hers is “As the
Turd Whirls,” and yours is “Fireside Chat with” whatever your name is.
JACOB
Yeah, but the point is, if you don’t change, then it’s not...
KIPP
And this is more of it. This is more Angel coming out of you. Same thing!
JACOB
Yeah.
KIPP
Same thing. Diff erent meaning, that’s all. And you’re attached to those quotes like she’s
attached to the soap opera.
JACOB
Okay, okay, okay.
KIPP
That’s “shut up, shut up, shut up.”
JACOB
I didn’t mean that.
KIPP
Yes you did.
JACOB
I didn’t mean for it.
KIPP
Yeah, that’s the problem. That’s what you’re saying. You see, you don’t want to be with that
it’s empty and meaningless. You’ve got a nice neat package, just like Angel’s got a dramatic
package.
JACOB
And the problem with that is that I’m attracted to that meaning.
KIPP
Attracted to it? You’re addicted to it! That’s all you got.
Forum Day Three: Session Three 237
JACOB
No, no, no, I’m attracted to... I like the idea...
KIPP
So what if you like the idea? Why do you like it?
JACOB
Because it’s light-hearted. Taking the drama out of it...
KIPP
It’s like morning TV instead of afternoon TV. Doesn’t matter.
JACOB
Yeah, I know, what I’m saying is because I like your philosophy, I’m going to have to try to
make it meaningful...
KIPP
I don’t have a philosophy.
JACOB
Then what were you talking about?
KIPP
What I was saying. You think this is a philosophy. No philosophy here. Or if it is, it’s not The
Forum. See, this is fi reside chats with Jacob. This is your little place where you hang out. This
is your meaning you’re holding onto with your fi ngernails and your toes and everything else.
It’s all in a nice neat box, the same as Angel. And for everyone else here in the room, what you
should get is that this is what yours sounds like too, just your version of it.
ERHARD
This is not a philosophy. This is not a view of life. This is not one of the many views. This
is not another religion. That’s not what this is. It doesn’t replace or negate anything. It’s
more like dog shit than it is like philosophy—something to step in. If you treat it like
philosophy, you’ll fuck it up. If you’re going to treat it like something, treat it like dog shit.
Step in it.
KIPP
As you were saying, Jacob...
JACOB
I was just thinking that I should sit down because as long as I’m standing I’m going to want an
answer to all this.
The Same
In suggesting that the experiences evoked in The Forum and in
the est Training are at some level the same, we are venturing into
important and precarious Heideggerian territory. Werner Erhard
suggested the nature of this territory in a 1983 interview, when
challenged to compare the est Training with other enlightenment
systems, such as Zen:
I think that discussions about enlightenment
are useless, and I think making enlightenment
sacred is even more futile. My question is, what’s
this conversation all about? . . . We’re not really
talking about anything. I don’t know how else to
respond to you. You can’t ask, “Is this enlighten-
ment like that enlightenment?” That’s counting
enlightenments. That’s nuts! (Network Review,
1:4, September 1983, emphasis added)
“
238
SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
Then when you sit down you’ll do whatever you do when you sit down. And that’s all there is.
JACOB
What’s the motivation then?
KIPP
Whatever it is. You are the kind of being that thinks there has to be a motivation. There is
no motivation, because there’s no place to get to. People who are addicted to motivation are
addicted to trying to get somewhere. Can you see that that’s the source of motivation? But there
is no place to get to. You know why?
JACOB
Why?
KIPP
There’s no place to get to because it’s already turned out. This is the way it turned out. How do
you like it?
JACOB
No.
KIPP
It doesn’t matter. You turned out this way, right?
JACOB
Yeah, but, it’s imperfect. I can live with it, but...
KIPP
What’s imperfect?
JACOB
The world’s imperfect.
KIPP
Where?
JACOB
Ethiopia.
KIPP
Ethiopia is Ethiopia.
One cannot compare enlightenment experiences, because one
cannot compare nothing with nothing, since there is only one
nothing. Or, as an alternative interpretation, there is no nothing;
nothing is a nullity, its existence is self-nullified. There is nothing to
be compared. And yet, I can say these sentences, so nothing can be
talked about.
In Heidegger’s words, “‘there is given’ [es gibt] the Nothing.”
He adds: “but we cannot, at present, determine more closely who
or what gives the Nothing” (BC 45). That question must remain
open to call forth thinking. So Heidegger moves on to another
possible interpretation of the situation: “We can also say that the
Nothing presences [west], in order to indicate that the Nothing is
not merely the absence and lack of beings” (BC 45).
The Nothing does not first need beings and a
being in order to presence, as if it would pres-
ence only if beings were eliminated in advance.
The Nothing is not the result of such an elimina-
tion. There is given the Nothing in spite of the
fact that beings are. (BC 45)
“
We referred to this territory as precarious, not because the topic
is subversive, but because the conversation can easily begin to
sound silly. Sophomoric. Heidegger is not surprised that we may
be thinking this:
Here we easily fall into the danger of playing
with words. People make use of the justifiable
indication of this danger in order to banish all
thought “about” the Nothing as fatal. But the
danger is no less that, because we seem to be
merely playing around with words, we take the
Nothing too lightly and fail to recognize that
there is given the Nothing. (BC 45–46)
“
Forum Day Three: Session Three 239
JACOB
I want to change it. I know this sounds sappy...
KIPP
Not sappy. Just disempowering. You’re the kind of guy that’s going to make no diff erence
because you’re going to try to change Ethiopia. Where is the world imperfect?
JACOB
There’s two kinds of perfect. There’s what you strive for, which we are neglecting here, and
then there is what already is.
WES (standing on the platform)
Let’s deal with your life fi rst. You haven’t seen what you look like.
JACOB
Yeah.
WES
You’re talking to Kipp like someone who hasn’t seen what a human being looks like who
follows what you’re talking about. You’re proposing a way of being and you haven’t seen how
absurd it is. When you see how absurd it is you’ll give it up in a minute: The absurdity of the
story that uses people’s lives.
JACOB
Yeah, I was going to say that there’s what happened, and then there’s the story. It makes life
interesting.
WES
What makes life interesting? Certainly not your story. You know what you’re story looks like?
JACOB
Yeah, violins playing in the background.
WES
Yeah, good.
JACOB
But it’s still interesting to me.
WES
No it isn’t. It stinks. There’s no possibility. This is what you look like. I’m going to demonstrate
you.
Our experience with the work of Werner Erhard has led us to the
recognition that a transformational leap must pass through the
domain of meaninglessness, and that an experience of Being
requires a confrontation with non-Being. We will therefore endure
(or enjoy) any silliness we encounter, and recognize that we are
mining one of the richest veins of Heidegger’s thought—perhaps
his most essentially reflexive distinction, sometimes his most
perplexing, but inevitably a ride we want to be along for.
A core rubric for this distinction is the Same; and since a distinction
can only be hinted at, Heidegger approaches this one throughout his
writing from various directions. In the 1941 lecture series published as
Basic Concepts, it emerges in a section concerning Being’s uniqueness,
and its diff erence in that respect from beings:
Beings can always be compared with beings
and placed into equivalence with one another.
However, [B]eing is never merely what is equiv-
alent in the manifold beings stone, plant, ani-
mal, man, God. For to be what is equivalent it
would have to be multiple. Being, by contrast is
everywhere the same, namely, itself. In order to
be equivalent, something other and additional
is required. To be the same, only uniqueness is
needed. (BC 44)
“
Heidegger’s languaging in such writing trips up our thinking. It
forces us to stop and double back, to be certain that what we
understood was what was said. It pulls the rug from under us.
Heidegger’s next sentence gives a final yank to a rug already
well-pulled:
As the same and unique, [B]eing is, of course,
forever diff erent in and from itself. (BC 44)
“
Thinking and Being
In the 1954 collection of essays entitled Early Greek Thinking,
Heidegger develops the distinction “the Same” in his exploration
of two fragments by Parmenides. A central question for
240
SPEAKING BEING
Wes held a pen about a foot in front of his mouth, trying to bite it while continuing to hold it out of
reach, and chasing it around the stage while complaining about his failure to reach it.
JACOB
Yeah, I could have told you that, though...
WES (continuing to try to bite the carrot)
I’ll get there. Shit. I’ll get a Ph.D. Shit. I’ll get married. Shit...
At this moment a participant seated in the “no-video” section of the room called out angrily that
the cameraman focused on Jacob was also including those seated in the “no-video” section. Kipp
promised that it would be handled and it was.
JACOB (returning to the conversation)
I get that. I’m like a stupid donkey tied to a cart chasing a carrot, trying to get it. But I see that
I’m just a little bit hungry and that’s leading me toward perfection.
WES
No, that’s bullshit.
JACOB
Okay, why?
WES
Because it is.
JACOB
Okay, can I do a demonstration of you?
WES
No.
JACOB
Why not?
WES
Because I said so.
JACOB
Dick.
Heidegger—an important subordinate question to his overarching
question of Being—concerns the relation between Being and
thinking. What is the nature of that relation? How intimately do the
two phenomena belong together?
One of these Parmenidean fragments has traditionally been
translated, “For thinking and Being are the Same.” Here Heidegger
interrogates that translation:
Does this word give us an answer to the ques-
tion of how thinking belongs to Being, in that it
says both are “the Same”? The word gives no
answer. In the first place, because the deter-
mination “the Same” precludes any question
about “belonging together,” which can only
exist between things that are diff erent. In the
second place, because the word “the Same”
says nothing at all about the point of view
from which, and for what reason, diff erence
passes over into sameness. Thus to auto, the
Same, remains the enigmatic key word for both
fragments—if not for the whole of Parmenides’
thought. (EGT 88)
“
Heidegger leaves us in the dark here, because he wants us to
place that enigmatic term in question. He wants us to recognize
our tendency to gloss challenging ideas with easy and familiar
interpretations:
Of course if we are of the opinion that the word
to auto, the Same, means “identical,” and if
we accept “identity” completely as the most
transparent presupposition for the thinkability
of whatever is thinkable, then by this opinion
we become progressively more deaf to the key
word, assuming that we have ever heard its
call. It is suff icient, however, to keep the word
in our hearing in its thought-provoking charac-
ter. In doing so we remain listeners. . . . (EGT 88)
“
Forum Day Three: Session Three 241
WES
You’re doing whatever you’re doing, and you’re adding this story that it’s leading me toward
perfection. But it’s leading you toward a hole in the ground, and they’re going to throw you in
it, and they’re going to throw dirt in your face. Think about that.
JACOB
Yeah, yeah. That’s what happened.
WES
No, that’s what will happen.
JACOB
Yeah, when I get there that will be what happened. I don’t mind adding a story to my life, just
to make it interesting, or entertaining. I don’t mind tinting my life with fi ction. Just to make it
interesting.
ERHARD
You were doing fi ne until you added the “just to make it interesting.”
JACOB
Or entertaining.
ERHARD
Or “just to make it entertaining.” The story “in order to be entertained.” That’s terrible.
JACOB
Yeah, yeah.
ERHARD
The purpose to the story is the story.
JACOB
Yeah, yeah.
ERHARD
What’s more entertaining than a tree? Nothing. Standing in front of a tree: nothing can be
more entertaining than standing in front of a tree.
JACOB
So when you take what happened then there should be automatic meaning added to it without
having to play violins...
ERHARD
There’s no meaning to it. The tree doesn’t mean anything. It’s just a tree.
We have suggested that an essential relationship exists between the
experience evoked in the est Training and that made available in The
Forum; and we have said that neither experience is captured in the
spoken words of the conversations, but that both are communicated
in the unspoken context of those words. Heidegger likewise directs
us to consider the character of the context. If modern human beings
are to engage in a thoughtful dialogue with the writing of the pre-
Socratics—and Heidegger sees such a dialogue as critical for this
moment in history—then we must begin to apprehend in our thinking
“the unified totality of the manifold” (EGT 22).
Dialogue with early Greek thinking will be fruit-
ful only when such listening occurs. It is proper
to dialogue that its conversation speak of the
same thing; indeed that it speak out of partici-
pation in the Same. (EGT 22)
“
Over the vast chasm of time and language, can what we hear
be the same as what the Greek thinkers are saying? To develop
this question, Heidegger places a passage from the pre-Socratic
thinker Parmenides alongside one from the thinking of a modern
philosopher, Nietzsche, and makes this observation regarding the
juxtaposition:
The ancient fragment of early Western thinking
and the late fragment of recent Western think-
ing bring the Same to language, but what they
say is not identical. However, where we can
speak of the Same in terms of things which are
not identical, the fundamental condition of a
thoughtful dialogue between recent and early
times is automatically fulfilled. . . . [G]ranting
the diff erences between these epochs, we are
together with the early thinkers in the realm of
the Same. (EGT 23)
“
242
SPEAKING BEING
JACOB
Rather than meaning, there’s a plot to it.
ERHARD
There’s no plot to it. You add the plot. And you’re not doing it to entertain yourself. You’re doing
it because you’re doing it. You justify doing it in here when we get you to see that you’re doing it
by saying I’m doing it in order to entertain myself. But you’re not doing it. And you’re not doing
it to entertain yourself.
JACOB
But what if it does entertain me?
ERHAD
Then it does. But you don’t do it in order to entertain yourself.
JACOB
Yeah. You don’t do anything in order to anything.
ERHARD
Exactly. You do what you do and you don’t do what you don’t do. And you got all the
justifi cation that you add to that.
JACOB
I do what I like.
ERHARD
You don’t do what you like.
JACOB
That would be an in-order-to.
ERHARD
Right. Nobody ever does what they like. They do what they do. Have you ever done anything
you didn’t do?
JACOB
No.
ERHARD
Have you ever done anything you didn’t like to do?
JACOB
Yeah.
Thus we can say, in the sense that Heidegger is distinguishing
here, that the est Training and The Forum are the Same but not
identical. Further, we can likewise say that the Same relationship
exists between the “single thought” of Heidegger’s thinking and
the transformational experience evoked in The Forum.
Heidegger further teases out the distinction “the Same” in a
discussion of the Logos, the site where beings, emerging into
the world of meaning, are gathered and sheltered. Although in
the West logos is traditionally translated as discourse or spoken
language—and for Heidegger, of course, language is the realm of
Being—the root term, legein, does not primarily indicate speaking,
but means to lay down, to lay before.
To say is legein. This sentence, if well thought,
now sloughs off  everything facile, trite, and vac-
uous. It names the inexhaustible mystery that
the speaking of language comes to pass from the
unconcealment of what is present. (EGT 64)
Saying and talking occur essentially as the letting-
lie-together-before of everything which, laid in
unconcealment, comes to presence. (EGT 63)
“
A central question for Heidegger concerns the truth of a
being—the Being of the being—at the point of its emergence
into the world. How can we perceive the thing itself, physis in
the moment of its first flowering into meaning, but before its
deflowering by the distortions of opinion and perspective? At
the heart of the matter, says Heidegger in this intensely reflexive
passage, is the possibility of openness to letting, and to the Same:
before us as lying-before. It establishes this as
itself. It lays one and the Same in one. It lays one
as the Same. Such legein lays one and the same,
the omon. Such legein is omologein: One as the
Same, i.e., a letting-lie-before of what does lie
before us, gathered in the self-sameness of its
lying-before. (EGT 66)
“
Forum Day Three: Session Three 243
ERHARD
You do what you do, and coincidentally it sometimes matches the story you’ve got about what
you like to do. And what makes you stupid is to say, “When I’m good I do what I like to do and
when I’m bad I do what I don’t like to do.” No. When you’re bad you’re bad and when you’re
good you’re good. And don’t fuck it up with all that philosophical horseshit. That’s what he
means by fi reside chat. That’s your racket Jacob. I know you think that’s the way to be. I know
you think that’s the right way to be.
JACOB
No, it’s a way to be.
ERHARD
No, it’s not even a way to be. That’s just the way you are.
JACOB
And if I do it another way, it’ll be another way.
ERHARD
But you won’t do it another way. You’ll do it the way you do it. That conversation is
nonsensical. It gets you into trouble. Things are the way they are, and they are always not the
way they’re not. And what you do is say that you do it to make life interesting; and not because
that’s the right thing to say, but because that’s what you do.
JACOB
But the one thing that I can control is...
ERHARD
But here’s the thing. You’re not getting the point, Jacob. You’re too engaged in the
conversation. Listen to what’s not being said. There’s something to get out of the conversation
and I’m not going to say it and you’re not going to say it. It’s going to be unsaid. And that’s
what there is to get here. Otherwise you’re paying 625 dollars to pass on your philosophy to a
guy who couldn’t care less. You paid him to pass on your philosophy.
JACOB
I paid 625 dollars to hear your philosophy.
ERHARD
No, I don’t have any philosophy. All I have is dog shit.
JACOB
How about my philosophy through you?
ERHARD
That’s horseshit. I don’t like philosophies. That’s more nah nah nah nah nah. Philosophies.
Heidegger’s languaging here may occur as tortured or as
poppycock, unless we keep in mind the enigmatic nature of
hints, which always beckon us away from that toward which
they simultaneously point us; and of reflexive languaging, which
creates perplexities to liberate our thinking. Under the rubric of the
Same, Heidegger is distinguishing a way of listening for the world,
and he invites us to follow:
To think is surely a peculiar aff air. The word of
thinkers has no authority. The word of thinkers
knows no authors, in the sense of writers. The
word of thinking is not picturesque; it is with-
out charm. The word of thinking rests in the
sobering quality of what it says. Just the same,
thinking changes the world. It changes it in the
ever darker depths of a riddle, depths which
as they grow darker off er promise of a greater
brightness. (EGT 78)
“
We read in this passage an iteration of The Forum’s rhetorical
process, which takes participants down one level at a time to
confront the empty depths of the Nothing, before lighting the
opening that has thereby been unconcealed.
244
SPEAKING BEING
JACOB
Okay.
ERHARD
You’re up there and this is The Forum. It’s not like I picked you out. Why am I staying in this
conversation with you? The Forum is for you and I to engage in this until what you’re not
saying and what I’m not saying is there for you to hear. There’s something to hear that neither
of us is going to say. That’s the name of this game. It’s underneath all that wisdom you got. I’m
not denigrating your wisdom. Your wisdom’s pretty good. I like it. And if we were out having a
drink I would listen to it and discuss it. I would. I like that stuff  too. But that’s not The Forum.
The Forum is to get what’s underneath that. And what there is to get here is that it’s empty and
meaningless. Now you’re a pretty sharp guy and you got some of that. But now you’re going to
turn that into a philosophy. Don’t do that. Just get it. It’s empty and meaningless, and it’s empty
and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless. And life is not going to turn out.
JACOB
It’s the part that it is empty and meaningless that gets me, because that has a little bit of
meaning to it.
ERHARD
No. It has no meaning to it. That’s why I said it is empty and meaningless that it is empty and...
JACOB
I guess it was because I was thinking “because.”
ERHARD
Beautiful. Exactly. You got it. You can’t get “because” in there at all. Zero. If you add “because,”
you’re above zero. At zero it’s just empty and meaningless and it’s empty and meaningless that
it’s empty and meaningless. It’s not your life that’s empty and meaningless. It’s a rainstorm. Life
is empty and meaningless and you showed up in that, and got wet in it. It’s not your particular
little crappy life that’s empty and meaningless. It’s that life is empty and meaningless. That’s
what we showed up in.
Erhard stood close to Jacob and spoke intimately.
ERHARD
Jacob, you want to listen up here. Some people I don’t identify with. I can get them because I’m
trained to get them. I can identify with you. And you’re sharp enough to fuck yourself. I know
you can do it because I did it. I got the answers very early, and I developed them really well, but
I got them as answers.
JACOB
Yes, I’ve got this bucket of answers I carry around with me.
The Forum is for you and I to engage in this
until what you’re not saying and what I’m not
saying is there for you to hear. There’s some-
thing to hear that neither of us is going to say.
That’s the name of this game.

بله ، شما آن را به یک اپرا صابون لعنتی تبدیل کردید. شما می خواهید آن را بدست آورید ، می خواهید آن را واقعی کنید
روشن است زیرا می خواهید همین کار را انجام دهید. شما آن را انجام خواهید داد من در مورد آن به شما نمی گویم بنابراین
که شما این کار را نمی کنید. این یک احمق از من خواهد بود. ‘چون این کار را خواهید کرد. به یاد داشته باشید "سوار شوید

بنابراین ، شما ساخته اید که به چه معنی است؟ فرشته
که من اهمیتی نمی دهم خشونت معنا
انسان حیواناتی با زبان هستند. در نتیجه ، ما
روزانه در درک معنی دار از جهان بیدار شوید. ما
معنا را به هر آنچه که وجود دارد و هر آنچه که وجود دارد اختصاص دهید
اتفاق می افتد ما مجبور هستیم بدانیم که چیزهایی به چه معنی است و نمی تواند
بایستید که نمی دانید. برای درک عمق دلبستگی ما به معنی ،
نظر مارتین هایدگر را در نظر بگیرید: زبان یک خاصیت نبود
این به نوعی به انسان اعطا شد. فقط از طریق
زبانی که انسانها به انسان تبدیل شدند. انگیزه
به معنای و دانستن سازنده وجود ما است. خیلی زیاد است
ما به این ترتیب که نمی توانیم نزولی آن را تشخیص دهیم ، یعنی همین است
نکته مرگ ما در معنا منشأ اکثر مشکلات ما است. بنابراین در هر کاوش عمیق انسان ، مانند آن
در انجمن انجام شده است ، در نظر گرفتن عملکرد ضروری است
معنا ، و همچنین فرایندی که معانی در آن ظهور می کنند
جهان ، و در آنجا نیستند. چطور شد
جهان رخ می دهد چگونه انسان ها اتفاق افتاد؟ در نوشتن
فیلسوفان یونانی قبل از سوکراتیک ، هایدگر این دیدگاه را پیدا می کند:
موجوداتی که در حال حاضر در جهان وجود دارد به دلیل انسانها وجود دارد
آنها را به وجود آورد. علاوه بر این ، با انجام این کار ، ما در یکسان بودیم
زمان ایجاد خود به عنوان انسان. erhard (ادامه)

کله
دیروز چیزی در مورد عدم مراقبت دیدید. فرشته
من دیدم که مراقبت از گاهی اوقات خوب است و گاهی اوقات نمی کنم. کله
درست فرشته
خوب نیست که زندگی به معنای چیزی گاهی اوقات باشد و گاهی اوقات زندگی به معنای آن نیست
هر چیزی درز
این هرگز به معنای چیزی نیست. این به معنای گاهی اوقات چیزی نیست و به معنای چیزی نیست
اوقات دیگر زندگی خالی و بی معنی است. فرشته
پس چرا باید زنده باشم؟ پس نباید زنده باشم. مرده کله
سپس شما مردید. درز
شما می دانید که فقط چه کاری انجام داده اید؟ گفتم زندگی خالی و بی معنی است و شما این را معنی کردید
چیزی گفتم زندگی خالی و بی معنی است و شما از آن ناراحت شدید. "واقعاً؟ اوه. ما خواهیم کرد
شاید من الان دراز بکشم و تلویزیون تماشا کنم. "
فرشته
و بنابراین فقط به این دلیل که می گویید زندگی بی معنی است باید آن را باور کنم؟ درز
من نگفتم که چیزی باور کنم. آیا من به شما نگفتم که به چیزی که می گویم باور نکنید؟ فرشته
بله ، فراموش کردم. درز
حقیقت برای خودش صحبت می کند ، به من احتیاج ندارد. به هر حال ، وقتی گفتم "خالی و
بی معنی ، "شما گفتید ،" خدای من ، اوه که وحشتناک است. " شما خالی و بی معنی درست کردید
معنی چیزی شما یک ملکه درام هستید. فرشته (به شدت)
بله ، من هستم مرد ، تا آنجا که او به عنوان انسان وجود دارد ، همیشه داشته است
قبلاً در مورد فیزیک [بودن] صحبت شده است ،
در مورد کل غالب که خود او است
متعلق است انسان نه تنها از طریق
واقعیت و به منظور صحبت کردن خاص-
Cally در مورد چیزها ؛ برای وجود به عنوان انسان در حال حاضر
معنی: برای ساختن هر آنچه که غالب باشد وجود دارد
صحبت شده (FCM 26 ، تأکید اضافه شده است)
"
برای اینکه در مورد آنها صحبت شود ، باید از موجودات صحبت شود. برای
یونانیان ، "صحبت کردن به نام legein ؛ غالب که بوده است
صحبت از آرم ها "(FCM 26). اما هایدگر بیشتر پیشنهاد می کند
معنای اصلی برای هر دو کلمه: Legein ، به معنای اصلی خود ، بود
نه صحبت کردن ، بلکه جمع آوری و جمع آوری ، یا دراز کشیدن. آرم ، به عنوان چه
جمع شده و در مقابل ما گذاشته شده است ، اصل اصلی گردهمایی بود. این معنای "اصلی" آرم ها ، توجه ما را به خود جلب می کند
قبل از ظهور هر آنچه قبل از بیان وجود دارد - قبل از ظهور
قضاوت ، ادعای عقیده و تضاد
چشم انداز اینها البته اجتناب ناپذیر است. اما نوشتن
از پیش سکوراتیک ها به هایدگر پیشنهاد می کند که در طلوع آفتاب
بشریت ، چیزی برای دلهره انسان در دسترس بود ، الف
آرم ها ، که اکنون از ما فرار می کند. برای هراکلیتوس ، این آرم ها بود ، پس زمینه جمع آوری
نس ، در صورت ظهور آن به جهان ، نوسان می کند. در
بی معنی بودن که از آن موجودات ظهور می کنند نمی توانند حفظ کنند
خود در دنیایی از معنا ، اما برای لحظه ای در تاریخ ، برای آن ها
که برای ظهور آن باز بودند ، به نظر می رسید. هراکلیتوس
نشان می دهد که در دسترس است ، اما انسان به عنوان یک
کل - Hoi Polloi - برای نگاه کردن به آن در دسترس نیست. اما در حالی که آرم ها به طور مداوم خود باقی می مانند ،
انسان مانند کسانی که نمی کنند رفتار می کنند
درک (axunetoi) ، هر دو قبل از داشتن
شنیده و از آنها شنیده اند. بشر بشر بشر از این رو یکی
باید با هم در موجودات دنبال کنید - یعنی ،
به آن پایبند باشید اما در حالی که آرم ها اساساً غیر
در موجودات با هم جمع می شود ، زندگی انبوه
گویی هرکدام درک (حس) خود را داشتند. (هراکلیتوس ، قطعات 1-2 ، در IM 140-141)

خوب و به آن افتخار می کند. فرشته
و گاهی اوقات من نیستم. درز
ملکه چیپ کجاست؟ من قصد دارم شما را با هم جمع کنم. شما می توانید یک جلسه داشته باشید. این که
عالی خواهد بود در مورد فیلم ها صحبت کنید. این سرگرمی واقعی است: ملکه درام و تراشه
ملکه با هم. فرشته ، آیا می فهمید که من سعی نمی کنم شما را به روشی که شما نیستید
هستند؟ من به سادگی سعی می کنم نوری را که در آن ایستاده اید ، ریخته ام. من نمی خواهم شما راه نباشید
تو هستی من می دانم که شما یک ملکه درام هستید. شما همیشه به درام خواهید رسید. و من این کار را نکردم
بگو این بد است اما شما می خواهید همه چیز را به معنای چیزی بسازید. شما خود را بر روی همه پیچ می کنید
زمان چون شما آن را معنی می دهید. فرشته
آیا این انسان نیست که همه چیز را به معنای چیزی باشد؟ درز
این همان چیزی است که من گفتم ما قصد داشتیم ماهیت همیشه بودن برای انسان را فاش کنیم. فرشته
بنابراین آنچه من بدست آوردم این بود که من یک انسان هستم و نمی توانم از انسان بودن دور شوم. وت
من وقت زیادی را صرف کردم و کار کردم و سعی کردم یک انسان نباشم. درز
بسیار خوب ، اما اکنون شما آن را به یک گاو مقدس تبدیل کرده اید. شما یک انسان هستید
به یک گاو مقدس "اکنون پسر یک عوضی می خواهد گاو مقدس جدیدم را از من دور کند."
فرشته
و گاو مقدس جدید من یک انسان است. درز
بله ، شما آن را به نوعی داستان تبدیل کردید. به جای اینکه فقط یک انسان باشید که چرخیدید
این به یک اپرا صابون ، یک درام. زندگی به معنای هر چیزی نیست ، sweatheart. این به معنای یک چیز نیست. فرشته
شما نمی دانید که چقدر ناراحتم می کند. درز
من می فهمم که این باعث ناراحتی شما می شود. من به شما گفتم ، این دومین انجمن من است. من به شما گفتم وقتی من
دریافت که من واقعاً ناراحت شدم. فرشته
اما پس با آن چه کار کردید؟ هایدگر این تمایز را بیشتر توسعه می دهد:
هراکلیتوس می خواهد بگوید: انسان می شنود ،
و آنها کلمات را می شنوند ، اما در این شنوایی آنها
نمی توان "شنید" ، یعنی دنبال کنید ، چیست
مانند کلمات قابل شنیدن نیست ، آنچه صحبت نیست اما
آرم ها بشر بشر بشر اما شنیدن واقعی هیچ چیز ندارد
با گوش و زبان لعاب ، اما
در عوض به معنای مطیع پیروی از چه آرم ها است
IS: خود جمع موجودات. (IM 142-143)
"
آرم ها ، بودن ، با هم در موجودات ، پیشینه ناگفته است
در گفتگوی انجمن به نظر می رسد. اگر ما به دنبال آرم ها هستیم ، ممکن است این گردهمایی را بشنویم
سخنان هایدگر یکی از مهمترین و تحریک آمیز او
نکات: بازی مداوم او در مرز فازی بین بودن
و موجودات با اذیت کردن ، بیش از یک سال حرفه ای سال y ، این سوال
از نمایندگی در رابطه با وجود ، هایدگر انسان را فراهم کرد
فکر کردن با یک quandary اساساً بازتابنده ،
فکر کردن از طریق ممکن است ما را به یک جهش تبدیل کند و ما را با یک
درک آزادتر از جهان. اوایل هایدگر این سوال را در زمان و زمان ،
این بود که داسین از طریق
دستاورد قاطعیت و انتخاب های وجودی از این طریق
در دسترس ساخته شده است یکی از این گزینه ها متوقف کردن فرار از واقعیت شخص است
و بگذارید ، با تشخیص اینکه معانی آن ساخته شده است و
قابل انعطاف: "وقتی داسین مصمم است ، به طور واقعی به دست می گیرد
در وجود خود این واقعیت که این مبنای تهی تهی خود است "
(BT 354). در انجمن ، این خرید معتبر از وجود
با تمایز باطل امکان پذیر است (زندگی خالی است و
بی معنی) ، و از خود به عنوان مبنای تهی آن باطل (این است
خالی و بی معنی است که خالی و بی معنی است). هایدگر در بازپرداختهای بعدی خود ، تجاوز و تخصیص ، هایدگر
به سمت سمت پذیرنده تر تعادل موجود ، حرکت کرد ،
اجازه دادن و اجازه دادن به عنوان لحظه های دستیابی
اصالت اما پاکسازی در همه اینها باز شد
مفصل ها یکسان است ، که در Reverberations ناگفته ظاهر می شود
همانطور که تمایز از بین می رود. هایدگر گفت: "نکات ،"
وسیع ترین کره ای که در آن نوسان "(" DL "در جغد 27).

من بیش از حد ناراحت شدم. این نه تنها به معنای چیزی نیست ... (مکث)
گوش کن زندگی نه تنها خالی و بی معنی است ، بلکه خالی و بی معنی است که خالی است
و بی معنی ببینید ، برخی از آسفالت ها در اینجا می گویند ، "خوب ، اگر خالی و بی معنی باشد
سپس من به خانه می روم. "
(با صدای بلند)
نه! شما آن را به معنای چیزی ساختید! شما آن را دریافت نکردید. خالی و بی معنی است و خالی است
و بی معنی است که خالی و بی معنی است. زندگی به جایی نمی رود. مثل این است شما
این را دوست ندارید؟ خیلی بد این روشی است که هست. درست مثل این ، و آن ، و آن. فردا خواهد بود
مثل فردا ، و روز بعد مانند روز بعد خواهد بود. و یک سال از
اکنون مثل یک سال دیگر خواهد بود: مثل امروز. بسیاری از شما در حال شنیدن من توهین آمیز هستید
تمرین شما شما می دانید ، با توهین به تمرین خود ، بیایید آن را ، رابطه شما با خدا ، خود بنامیم
مراقبه ، هرچه هست. من به تمرین شما توهین نمی کنم. من توهین به تمرین در سفارش را دارم. شما هنگام تمرین تمرین می کنید. ساکت شو فقط تمرین کنید این نمی خواهد شما را به جایی برساند. اگر
شما برای رسیدن به جایی تمرین می کنید ، آن را متوقف کنید زیرا وقت خود را هدر می دهید. شما
قرار نیست به جایی برسم. شما همیشه در جایی که هستید درست خواهید بود. اگر طولانی تمرین می کنید
به اندازه کافی ، شما این کار را می کنید. با KIPP چند مورد دیگر صحبت کنید ، شما کار خوبی انجام می دهید. کله
حالا چی؟ فرشته
این یک سوال بسیار خوب است درز
خیلی خوب ... فرشته
من این واقعیت را دوست دارم که ... erhard
به یاد داشته باشید وقتی گفتم که فکر می کردید اگر این درام را ندارید ، دوباره شما بیرون می رود؟ فرشته

بله فرشته
اما من از احتمال داشتن یک بوم خالی از آن استفاده کردم. 230

درز
من می دانم شما این کار را به یک فیبر دیگر تبدیل کردید: درام ، به معنی ، cance scentifi. شما همه چیز را می گیرید
و آن را به گه تبدیل کنید. ما چیزی به نام امکان ایجاد می کنیم و شما آن را به نوعی تبدیل می کنید
لعنتی گوساله طلایی. مثل "اوه! این مرا نجات خواهد داد. مرد ، خوشحالم که به اینجا رسیدم! من نمی دانستم
این جواب بود. " پاسخ این است که هیچ پاسخی وجود ندارد.
جواب هر کاری که می کنید انجام دهید ، هرگز نمی خواهید این کار را به اندازه کافی انجام دهید
آن این به نتیجه نمی رسد زیرا قبلاً معلوم شد. و این روشی است که معلوم شد. عادل
مثل این فردا دقیقاً مثل فردا خواهد بود. و وقتی می میرید ، آنها شما را در یک جعبه قرار می دهند
و خاک را روی صورت خود پرتاب کنید. و اینگونه است که همه چیز معلوم خواهد شد. این به معنای چیزی نیست. فرشته
خوب اکنون که من این را می دانم ، چرا الان کثیفی را در صورتم نمی اندازم؟ درز
این به معنای چیزی است. و این به معنای درام بالایی است. شما می توانستید بگویید ، "من می روم
تلویزیون را تماشا کنید. " شما می توانستید این حرف را بزنید اما به اندازه کافی چشمگیر نیست.
در اینجا که دراماتیک های زیادی مانند شما نیستند. برخی از مردم می گویند "من به خانه می روم و تماشا می کنم
بازی. " مال شما "من خودم را می کشم." این فقط یک موضوع است.
در اینجا تغییر کنید. این متوقف می شود که به شکلی که هست. کله
حالا چی؟ آیا می توانید ببینید که چقدر به داشتن آن وصل شده اید؟ فرشته
بله دیروز من به مراقبت وصل شدم و این به معنای چیزی است. کله
بله ، و بنابراین آنچه شما به آن وصل شده اید پیوست شده است. درز
این برای اکثر شما کمی پیشرفته است. فرشته
بنابراین ، اگر من دیگر به آن وابسته نیستم ، به این معنی نیست که هنوز در آنجا نیست. این فقط یعنی من نیستم
دیگر به آن وصل شده است. درز
نه. این نوعی نعل اسب است. شما به آن وصل نشده اید. شما به آن وصل نشده اید ، و
این پایان آن داستان است. فرشته
اگر من در برابر آن مقاومت نمی کنم ، دیگر به آن وصل نشده ام. بیرون
جنبه دیگر این دیدگاه: در صحبت کردن ، ما هستیم
"سفر" چیزی که قبلاً وجود داشته است ، در پس زمینه ،
به عنوان یک امکان در واقع: "اگر ما از این وضعیت AFF استفاده کنیم
به روش ابتدایی و اصیل ، ما می بینیم که آنچه گفته می شود این است
در حال حاضر لزوماً در فیزیک است ، در غیر این صورت نمی توان گفت
از خارج از آن "(FCM 26). هایدگر این نکته را فشار می دهد: همه چیز
این وجود دارد که گفته شده است ، و هر آنچه بوده است
صحبت شده از قبل آنجا بود. بنابراین:
سوال برای ما این است: این لژین چه می کند ،
این صحبت کردن انجام شده است؟ آنچه در
آرم؟ آیا این فقط یک موضوع است که
آنچه در کل موجودات است به یک
کلمه ، فرموله شده ، به کلمه بیایید؟ برای آمدن
کلمه - این معنی چیست؟ (FCM 26-27)
"
هایدگر می گوید ، برای درک معنای یک اصطلاح یا مفهوم ،
ممکن است در نظر گرفتن برعکس آن مفید باشد. او در بخشی از
هراکلیتوس این پیشنهاد را که برعکس لژین - یعنی ، "نه
اجازه دهید به کلمه بیاید " - برای یونانیان دقیقاً درک شده است
پنهان کردن:
از این طریق لزوماً به این نتیجه می رسد که
عملکرد ذهنی لژین این است که هر کاری را انجام دهید
غالب از پنهان کاری. بشر بشر بشر آشکار ، ‘tak-
از پنهان کردن ، "این اتفاق می افتد که
در آرم ها رخ می دهد. در آرم ها ، غالب
از موجودات آشکار می شود ، می شود-
جشنواره (FCM 27)
"
روز اول انجمن: جلسه سه 231
بنابراین ، این همان چیزی است که در صحبت کردن ما اتفاق می افتد: ما صحبت می کنیم
از پنهان شدن ؛ ما دنیای موجودات را غافل می کنیم. چقدر خوشبخت هستیم
آیا ما توانایی ایجاد معانی را داریم و از این طریق می توانیم در آن زندگی کنیم
دنیایی از فرهنگ و فناوری ، و از مزایای آنها بهره می برد. اما البته در این مورد صلاحیت وعده ای وجود دارد
وضعیت ، که هایدگر در جای دیگری در نوشتن هراکلیتوس پیدا می کند:
درز
ذن گلوله. فرشته
من اهل کالیفرنیا هستم درز
درست است آخرین چیزی که شما گفتید کیپ چیست؟ کله
شما به پیوست بودن پیوست شده اید. erhard (نشانگر فرشته)
تو تو بودی نور کمی در حال ظهور. پیوست به معنی. این همان چیزی بود که بود او به تو گفت
به معنی وصل شده بودند ، و شما گفتید دیروز من به مراقبت وصل شده ام و همین باعث شده است
معنی چیزی و امروز من یک سطح اساسی تر را پایین آورده ام ، "من پیوست شده ام
به معنی. "
فرشته
بله درز
بله شما به معنی پیوستید. این همان چیزی است که می توان دریافت کرد. شما با معنی گیر کرده اید. شما آزادی ندارید. همه چیز باید به معنای چیزی باشد. همه چیز باید باشد
قابل توجه نیست. این ملکه درام است. فرشته
من نمی بینم چه چیزی باقی مانده است. درز
بنابراین من به شما می گویم. شما می خواهید بدانید چه چیزی باقی مانده است؟ هیچی چیزی که مانده است هیچ چیز نیست. من به شما گفتم
ما قصد داشتیم راه خود را به صفر برگردانیم. این صفر است. فرشته
من نمی توانم با صفر باشم. درز
من می دانم من به شما گفتم که این مرا ناراحت کرد. این درست نخواهد بود این به شکلی خواهد بود. آنچه باید با آن وجود داشته باشد این است که زندگی خالی و بی معنی است. این همان چیزی است که باید با آن وجود داشته باشد. من
قرار نیست معلوم شود این درست نخواهد بود. این به هر روشی لعنتی خواهد بود. با این حال است. فرشته
مهم نیست که چه کاری انجام می دهم؟ دوست داشتن پنهان کردن چرا اینطور است سوالی است که هایدگر برای آن
پاسخی را مشخص نمی کند ، زیرا این سؤال باید باز شود. در چرخش آن سؤال باز ، تفکر ممکن است متمایز شود
مسیرهای جدید به وجود. به عنوان مثال ، اگر انجمن مکالمه است
برای ظهور وجود ، و اگر تلاش برای پنهان کردن خود است ،
سپس پیامدهای جالب در مورد ماهیت
تجربه انجمن ، که ما همچنان به کشف و آشکار شدن می پردازیم
این نوارهای جانبی و فواصل. ■
[i] f غالب از پنهان شدن در
آرم ها ، پس باید ، مانند گذشته ، سعی کنید پنهان شود
خود همان هراکلیتوس به ما می گوید
علاوه بر این بشر بشر چرا فیزیک فاش شد
و از پنهان کردن صریح در لژین پاره شده است. در مجموعه قطعات یک جمله
تنها ایستاده است که تا به امروز هرگز نبوده است
درک شده یا درک شده در عمق آن:
"غالب چیزها به خودی خود تلاش می کند
برای پنهان کردن خود. " (FCM 27 ، تأکید اضافه شده است)

وجود
درز
بله ، اما ببینید ، چیزی کمی در این مورد وجود دارد ، زیرا شما فقط می خواهید آنچه را که هستید انجام دهید
رفتن به انجام مردم کاری را که می خواهند انجام دهند انجام نمی دهند. آنها آنچه را انجام می دهند انجام می دهند. شما همیشه چه کاری انجام می دهید
شما انجام می دهید و شما همیشه کاری را که می خواهید انجام دهید انجام نمی دهید ، آیا؟ تنها باری که کاری را انجام می دهی
می خواستم انجام دهم این است که به طور تصادفی کاری که انجام دادید. شما آنچه را که می خواستید انجام نمی دهید
انجام شما کاری را که انجام می دهید انجام می دهید. و شما این داستان لعنتی خدا را در مورد خواسته ها گرفتید. مردم
آنچه را که می خواهند انجام دهند انجام دهید. آنها آنچه را که انجام می دهند ، همیشه و فقط انجام می دهند. "می خواهم" یک داستان است. مانند
توضیح بیماری با ارواح شیطانی. voodoo ستاره ها برای آنچه می خواهید حرکت نمی کنند. شما انجام می دهید
کاری که شما انجام می دهید ، و آنچه را که انجام نمی دهید انجام نمی دهید. و بقیه آن داستانی جنجالی است
این سادگی ، قدرت ، شیرینی راه را از بین می برد. ببین ، آیا تا به حال متوجه شده ای
شما هرگز لعنتی رضایت بخش نیستید؟ همیشه این تفاوت چندانی ندارد که چقدر خوب است. هرگز
آنچه را که به دست می آورید تفاوت ایجاد می کند. همیشه همیشه شما فقط نمی توانید دریافت کنید که این همان است. کیپ ، به آنها بگویید
در مورد زندگی تمرین کار خود را در مورد کارت های بازی انجام دهید. کله
کارتهای بازی زندگی ... کیپ یک کاغذ کاغذ - به عنوان کارت - به سینه او نگه داشت. کله
آنچه که انسان بودن است این است که به Aces خود ادامه دهید. چون می دانید ، یک بار در
زندگی وقتی همه چیز را به شما دادید ... erhard
وقتی یک بار بچه بودید ، اوج خود را به شما هدیه دادید و خرد شدی ... هر یک از
شما و از آن به بعد ، شما "من بازی های خود را بازی نمی کنم." این تصمیم صرفاً یا
صرفاً فکر می کنید ، از آن پس شما "من Aces خود را بازی نمی کنم."
کله
شما به عنوان یک فرد باهوش شناخته شده اید. آنچه یک فرد باهوش به نظر می رسد شخصی است که
در اطراف نگه داشتن Aces خود قدم می زند. سپس به همراه انیشتین آمد ، و انیشتین گفت: مشکلات آن
ما قرار نیست با روشی که فکر می کنیم به آن مشکلات رسیدیم حل شود ... erhard (قطع کردن کیپ)
نگه دارید ، آن نقل قول را لعنتی نکنید. کله
شما آن را لعنتی (خنده)
درز
مشکلاتی که ما داریم قرار نیست در سطحی که در آن ایجاد کردیم حل شود. چه
این یعنی؟ واقعاً ساده است شما جایی در زندگی دارید. مردم به جایی رسیده اند
مردم کاری را که می خواهند انجام دهند انجام نمی دهند. آنها انجام می دهند
کاری که انجام می دهند شما همیشه کاری را که انجام می دهید انجام می دهید. وت
شما همیشه کاری را که می خواهید انجام دهید انجام نمی دهید ، انجام دهید
شما؟ تنها باری که می خواستید انجام دهید
آیا این است که به طور تصادفی کاری که شما انجام دادید. "
روز اول انجمن: جلسه سه 233
زندگی آنچه شما را در آنجا به وجود آورد ، مشکلاتی را که به دست آورده اید به شما می دهد. این چیزی نیست که شما چیزی را لعنتی کرده اید
در راه این است که شما موفق شده اید. اگر از آنچه برای رسیدن به جایی که هستید استفاده می کنید ، آن
موفقیت و مجموعه خاصی از مشکلات را تولید می کند. شما نمی توانید آن مشکلات را با آن حل کنید
که با آن موفق شدید ، زیرا این مشکلات محصول مورد استفاده شما است
برای موفقیت این را گرفتی؟ این مشکلات محصول رسیدن به اینجا است و شما نمی توانید
آن مشکلات را با آنچه شما در اینجا به وجود آورد ، حل کنید. چون آنچه شما را به اینجا رسانده است ، شما را به اینجا و
این مشکلات را به شما داد. شما نمی توانید مشکلاتی را که در آن دارید حل کنید
مشکلات را ایجاد کرد. کله
بنابراین آنچه لازم است سطح جدیدی از تفکر است. در اینجا به نظر می رسد: شما همه Aces من را می خواهید؟ اینجا! کیپ تکه های کاغذ را به نمایندگی از Aces خود به جلو انداخت. کله
اما شما نمی توانید این کار را انجام دهید زیرا اگر این کار را کردید ، از زندگی استفاده می کنید. درز
او کمی خنده دار است و شما آن را دریافت نمی کنید. شما آسفالت لعنتی! شما به Aces خود ادامه دادید
شما عادت نخواهید کرد شما می خواهید به قبر خود بروید که Aces خود را نگه دارید. KIPP ادامه داد ، بسیار زیاد نشان داد که این کار را به این همسر نمی دهد ، این کار ،
و غیره
ببینید ، من قصد نداشتم که او را به همسرم کریستین بدهم ، زیرا او یکی نبود. شما
بدانید که یکی به نظر می رسد بلند ، بلوند ، همیشه اسب سوار می شود و هرگز لباس نمی پوشد. اینقدر
در هر زمان که با کریستین در یک مهمانی خواهم بود ، در صورت یکی از او خیلی نزدیک نمی شوم
سوار بر اسب شدم ، فقط می توانستم پرش کنم و از فاصله دور سوار شوم. چطور
کار؟ شما نمی خواهید ACE خود را به آن کار بدهید ، این فقط کار عملی است. در مورد شما چطور
بدن؟ سوال این است: چه چیزی در سنگ قبر شما نوشته خواهد شد؟ درز
شما این نکته را می گیرید. این زندگی واقعی شما نیست. شما زندگی تمرین خود را زندگی می کنید. هیچ کس نمی خواهد
به اندازه کافی احمق باشید که زندگی واقعی آنها را انجام دهید و کاری را که با آن انجام داده اید انجام دهید. فرض کنید شما بودید
با همسر واقعی خود ازدواج کرد - منظورم مثل واقعی است. مرد ، شما همه چیز را به او می دادید. هر چیزی که دارید اما کسی که با آن ازدواج کرده اید "همسر تمرین" شماست. در اینجا چگونه آورده شده است
می توانید بگویید اگر او یکی بود ، زن رویاهای شما ، شما مانند شما نیستید
با او ، و شما آن را می دانید. همین کار را با شغل خود شما به هر آنچه به دست آورده اید نمی دهید
این کار این فقط یک کار عملی است. شما وقتی که واقعی به وجود می آید ، Aces خود را حفظ می کنید. این زمانی است که شما زندگی خود را صرف زندگی خود می کنید ، وقتی واقعی می آید ، اما نه
این زندگی اگر از آنچه برای رسیدن به جایی که هستید استفاده می کنید ، آن
موفقیت و مجموعه خاصی از مشکلات را تولید می کند. شما نمی توانید این مشکلات را با آن حل کنید
که شما موفق شده اید ، زیرا این مشکلات
محصولی از آن چیزی است که شما برای موفقیت در آن استفاده کرده اید. "

من فقط فکر می کردم اگر شما عبارت "هیچ چیز به معنای چیزی" باشید. در
کلمات قابل تعویض هستند. کلمه هیچ چیز به معنای چیزی نیست. هر چیزی هیچ چیز نیست. این که
ممکن است نوع کمبود هیپی باشد که دوست ندارید. درز
درست است ژاکت
می دانم ، می دانم. من آن را دوست ندارم ، اما ... erhard
من به شما می گویم که من چه کاری را دوست دارم ، آیا من دوست دارم که شما درگیر مکالمه باشید. چه من
دوست ندارید در مورد آن صورت بگیرید. آیا می دانید منظور من از کلمه Facile چیست؟ با آسان زندگی کنید
آن ژاکت
بله درز
شما باید با آن دست و پنجه نرم کنید. شما باید با این کار پایین بیایید. این برخی از تله های پری هوایی نیست. من نگفتم که شما باید مثل من بد صحبت کنید. شما باید به روش خود پایین بیایند ، اما
باید پایین بیاید شما باید از آن گه های "Whoooo" خارج شوید. کله
و شما آن را به آن تبدیل کرده اید. آیا این را می دانید؟ ژاکت
بله فکر می کنم چند روز پیش در مورد انجام کارهایی که می توانید یا نمی توانید انجام دهید ، بگویم ، فکر می کنم
این بنیامین فرانکلین بود که گفت ... (فراموش کردن)

من می دانم که آنها چه گفتند ، اما هرگز نمی توانم آن را به یاد بیاورم. ما شما را می خوانیم که انیشتین
به نقل از ما بعداً قصابی کردیم. (خنده)

الان به یاد دارم او از شخصیت کلمه شخصیت خوبی برخوردار بود. داشتن شخصیت دنبال کردن است

آنچه او می گوید این است که روشی که شما به آنچه در اتاق اتفاق می افتد گوش می دهید مانند یک
مفهوم شما همان کاری را انجام می دهید که فرشته انجام می دهد ، فقط یک معنی متفاوت است. هرس "به عنوان
گردبادهای Turd ، "و شما" چت با آتش سوزی با "هر آنچه نام شما است. یعقوب است
بله ، اما نکته این است که ، اگر تغییر نکنید ، پس ... کیپ نیست
و این بیشتر از آن است. این بیشتر فرشته است که از شما بیرون می آید. همین چیز! ژاکت
بله کله
همان چیز معنی متفاوت ، این همه است. و شما به آن نقل قول هایی مانند او متصل هستید
متصل به اپرا صابون. ژاکت
خوب ، خوب ، خوب. کله
این "تعطیل ، تعطیل ، خاموش" است. "
ژاکت
منظور من این نبود. کله
بله شما این کار را کردید ژاکت
منظور من نبود کله
بله ، این مشکل است این همان چیزی است که شما می گویید می بینید ، شما نمی خواهید با آن باشید
خالی و بی معنی است شما یک بسته مرتب و مرتب دارید ، دقیقاً مثل فرشته دراماتیک است
بسته بندی ژاکت
و مشکل این است که من به این معنی جذب می شوم. کله
جذب آن شد؟ شما به آن معتاد هستید! این تمام چیزی است که شما بدست آورده اید روز اول انجمن: جلسه سه 237

نه ، نه ، نه ، من جذب شده ام ... من ایده را دوست دارم ... کیپ
خوب اگر ایده را دوست دارید چه می کنید؟ چرا آن را دوست دارید؟ ژاکت
چون کم نور است گرفتن درام از آن ... کیپ
مثل تلویزیون صبح به جای تلویزیون بعد از ظهر است. مهم نیست ژاکت
بله ، من می دانم ، آنچه من می گویم به این دلیل است که من فلسفه شما را دوست دارم ، باید سعی کنم
آن را معنی دار کنید ... kipp
من یک فلسفه ندارم. ژاکت
پس شما در مورد چه چیزی صحبت می کردید؟ کله
آنچه می گفتم شما فکر می کنید این یک فلسفه است. هیچ فلسفی در اینجا وجود ندارد. یا اگر اینگونه باشد ، این نیست
انجمن. ببینید ، این FI Reside با Jacob است. این مکان کوچک شماست که در آنجا آویزان هستید. این
آیا معنی شماست که با دست و پا و انگشتان پا و هر چیز دیگری روی آن قرار دارید. این همه در یک جعبه مرتب و مرتب است ، همان فرشته. و برای هر کس دیگری اینجا در اتاق ، شما چه چیزی
باید بدست آورید که این همان چیزی است که شما نیز به نظر می رسد ، فقط نسخه شما از آن است. درز
این یک فلسفه نیست. این نمایی از زندگی نیست. این یکی از دیدگاه های بسیاری نیست. این
دین دیگری نیست. این چیزی نیست که این است. این چیزی را جایگزین یا نفی نمی کند. این است
بیشتر شبیه به گه سگ از آن مانند فلسفه است - چیزی که باید قدم بردارید. اگر با آن رفتار کنید
فلسفه ، شما آن را لعنتی خواهید کرد. اگر می خواهید مانند چیزی با آن رفتار کنید ، مانند گه سگ با آن رفتار کنید. قدم در آن کله

من فقط فکر می کردم که باید بنشینم زیرا تا زمانی که ایستاده ام می خواهم
پاسخ به همه اینها یکسان
در این نشان می دهد که تجربیات برانگیخته در انجمن و در
آموزش EST در بعضی از موارد یکسان است ، ما در حال ورود به آن هستیم
سرزمین مهم و نامطلوب هایدگریا. ورنر ارهارد
ماهیت این قلمرو را در مصاحبه ای در سال 1983 ، هنگامی که
برای مقایسه آموزش EST با سایر روشنگری ها به چالش کشیده شده است
سیستم هایی مانند ذن:
من فکر می کنم که بحث در مورد روشنگری
بی فایده هستند ، و من فکر می کنم روشنگری
مقدس حتی بیهوده تر است. سوال من این است ، چیست
این مکالمه همه چیز در مورد؟ بشر بشر بشر ما واقعاً نیستیم
صحبت در مورد هر چیزی من نمی دانم چگونه دیگر
به شما پاسخ دهید شما نمی توانید بپرسید ، "آیا این روشنگری است-
مانند آن روشنگری؟ " این حساب می کند
روشنگری این آجیل است! (بررسی شبکه ،

سپس وقتی می نشینید ، هنگام نشستن هر کاری را انجام می دهید. و این همه وجود دارد ژاکت
آن زمان انگیزه چیست؟ کله
هرچه هست شما نوع موجودی هستید که فکر می کنید انگیزه ای وجود دارد. وجود دارد
هیچ انگیزه ای ندارد ، زیرا جایی برای رسیدن به آن وجود ندارد. افرادی که به انگیزه معتاد هستند
معتاد به تلاش برای رسیدن به جایی. آیا می توانید ببینید که این منبع انگیزه است؟ اما آنجا
جایی برای رسیدن به آن نیست. می دانید چرا؟ ژاکت
چرا؟ کله
جایی برای رسیدن به آن وجود ندارد زیرا قبلاً معلوم شده است. این روشی است که معلوم شد. چگونه
شما آن را دوست دارید؟ ژاکت

بله ، اما ، ناقص است. من می توانم با آن زندگی کنم ، اما ... کیپ
ناقص چیست؟ ژاکت
ناقص جهان کله
کجا؟ ژاکت
اتیوپی کله
اتیوپی اتیوپی است. نمی توان تجربیات روشنگری را مقایسه کرد ، زیرا یکی
نمی تواند هیچ چیز را با هیچ چیز مقایسه کند ، زیرا فقط یک نفر وجود دارد
هیچی یا ، به عنوان یک تفسیر جایگزین ، هیچ چیز وجود ندارد.
هیچ چیز باطل نیست ، وجود آن به خودی خود زودهنگام است. هیچ چیز وجود ندارد
مقایسه شود و با این حال ، من می توانم این جملات را بگویم ، بنابراین هیچ چیز نمی تواند باشد
در مورد به قول هایدگر ، "" وجود دارد "[es gibt] هیچ چیز."
وی می افزاید: "اما ما در حال حاضر نمی توانیم با دقت بیشتری تعیین کنیم
یا آنچه به هیچ چیز نمی دهد "(قبل از میلاد 45). این سؤال باید باقی بماند
باز برای فراخوانی تفکر. بنابراین هایدگر به سمت دیگری حرکت می کند
تفسیر احتمالی از وضعیت: "ما همچنین می توانیم بگوییم که
هیچ چیز حاکی از [غرب] است ، تا نشان دهد که هیچ چیز نیست
نه فقط غیبت و فقدان موجودات »(قبل از میلاد 45)
برای حضور در حضور ، انگار که
فقط در صورتی که موجودات از قبل حذف شوند. هیچ چیز نتیجه چنین حذف نیست-
tion علی رغم هیچ چیز وجود ندارد
واقعیتی که موجودات هستند. (قبل از میلاد 45)
"
ما از این قلمرو به عنوان نامطلوب یاد کردیم ، نه به این دلیل که موضوع
خرابکارانه است ، اما از آنجا که مکالمه به راحتی می تواند شروع شود
صدا احمقانه سوفوموریک هایدگر تعجب نمی کند که ما ممکن است
به این فکر کنید:
در اینجا ما به راحتی در معرض خطر بازی قرار می گیریم
با کلمات مردم از توجیه پذیر استفاده می کنند
نشانه این خطر به منظور از بین بردن همه
فکر کردن در مورد "در مورد" هیچ چیز به عنوان کشنده است. اما
خطر کمتر نیست ، زیرا به نظر می رسد ما هستیم
ما فقط با کلمات بازی می کنیم ، ما
هیچ چیز خیلی سبک نیست و نمی تواند آن را تشخیص دهد
هیچ چیز وجود ندارد. (قبل از میلاد 45-46)
"

ژاکت
من می خواهم آن را تغییر دهم. من می دانم که این صداها خوشحال است ... کیپ
خوشحال نیست فقط قدرت را نادیده بگیرید. شما یک پسر هستید که نمی خواهید تفاوت چندانی نداشته باشید
از آنجا که می خواهید سعی کنید اتیوپی را تغییر دهید. جهان ناقص کجاست؟ ژاکت
دو نوع کامل وجود دارد آنچه شما در آن تلاش می کنید وجود دارد ، که ما در اینجا از آن غفلت می کنیم ، و
سپس آنچه در حال حاضر است وجود دارد. وس (ایستاده روی سکو)
بیایید با اولین زندگی شما سر و کار داشته باشیم. شما ندیده اید که چگونه به نظر می رسید. ژاکت
بله وهمی
شما مانند کسی که ندیده است که یک انسان به نظر می رسد با کیپ صحبت می کنید
آنچه را که در مورد آن صحبت می کنید دنبال می کند. شما راهی برای بودن را پیشنهاد می کنید و چگونه ندیده اید
پوچ است وقتی می بینید که چقدر پوچ است ، در یک دقیقه آن را تسلیم خواهید کرد: پوچی
داستانی که از زندگی مردم استفاده می کند. ژاکت
بله ، من قصد داشتم بگویم که آنچه اتفاق افتاده است ، و سپس داستان وجود دارد. این زندگی را می سازد
جالب وهمی
چه چیزی زندگی را جالب می کند؟ مطمئناً داستان شما نیست. شما می دانید داستان شما به نظر می رسد؟ ژاکت
بله ، ویولن ها در پس زمینه بازی می کنند. وهمی
بله ، خوب ژاکت
اما هنوز هم برای من جالب است. وهمی
نه نیست بد بو می شود. امکان وجود ندارد این همان چیزی است که شما به نظر می رسید. من قصد دارم نشان دهم
شما تجربه ما با کار ورنر ارهارد ما را به سمت
تشخیص اینکه یک جهش تحول آمیز باید از آن عبور کند
حوزه بی معنی بودن ، و آن تجربه بودن
نیاز به رویارویی با عدم تحمل دارد. بنابراین ما تحمل خواهیم کرد
(یا لذت ببرید) هرگونه صدایی که با آن روبرو می شویم ، و تشخیص می دهیم که ما هستیم
استخراج یکی از ثروتمندترین رگه های فکر هایدگر - شاید
اساساً تمایز انعکاسی او ، گاهی اوقات بیشترین او
گیج کننده ، اما ناگزیر سوارکاری که می خواهیم در کنار آن باشیم. یک موضوع اصلی برای این تمایز یکسان است ؛ و از آنجا که یک تمایز است
فقط می توان به آنها اشاره کرد ، هایدگر به این یکی نزدیک می شود
نوشتن از جهات مختلف. در سری سخنرانی های سال 1941 به عنوان
مفاهیم اساسی ، در بخشی از منحصر به فرد بودن بودن ، ظهور می کند ،
و تفاوت آن در این رابطه از موجودات:
موجودات همیشه با موجودات قابل مقایسه هستند
و با یکدیگر هم ارزی قرار گرفت. با این حال ، [b] eving هرگز صرفاً معادل نیست-
در موجودات منیفولد سنگ ، گیاه ، آن-
مال ، انسان ، خدا. برای اینکه معادل آن باشد
باید چندگانه باشد. در مقابل ، بودن است
در همه جا ، یعنی خود. به منظور
معادل باشید ، چیز دیگری و اضافی
لازم است یکسان بودن ، فقط منحصر به فرد بودن است
مورد نیاز (قبل از میلاد 44)
"
زبان هایدگر در چنین نوشتن به تفکر ما سفر می کند. من
ما را مجبور می کند که متوقف شویم و دو برابر شویم ، تا مطمئن باشیم که ما چه چیزی هستیم
فهم آنچه گفته شد فرش را از زیر ما می کشد. جمله بعدی هایدگر در حال حاضر یک فرش نهایی به فرش می دهد
خوب کشیده:
همانطور که یکسان و منحصر به فرد است ، البته [b]
برای همیشه متفاوت از خود و از خود. (قبل از میلاد 44)
"
فکر کردن و هستی
در مجموعه مقاله های سال 1954 با عنوان تفکر اولیه یونانی ،
هایدگر در کاوش خود تمایز "همان" را توسعه می دهد
از دو قطعه توسط پارمنیدها. یک سوال اصلی برای

وس قلم را در حدود یک پا در جلوی دهان خود نگه داشت و در حالی که همچنان به بیرون نگه داشتن آن ادامه داد ، سعی کرد آن را نیش بزند
در حالی که از عدم موفقیت وی در رسیدن به آن شکایت می کند ، دسترسی پیدا کنید و آن را در اطراف صحنه تعقیب کنید. ژاکت
بله ، من می توانستم به شما بگویم که ، هر چند ... وس (ادامه سعی در نیش هویج)
من به آنجا خواهم رسید گه من دکتری دریافت خواهم کرد. گه من ازدواج خواهم کرد گه ... در این لحظه یک شرکت کننده در بخش "بدون فیلم" اتاق نشسته بود
این فیلمبردار روی یعقوب نیز متمرکز شده بود ، از جمله کسانی بود که در بخش "No-Video" نشسته بودند. کله
قول داده است که به آن رسیدگی می شود و چنین بود. یعقوب (بازگشت به مکالمه)
من آن را دریافت می کنم من مثل یک خر احمقانه هستم که به سبد خرید یک هویج گره خورده است و سعی می کند آن را بدست آورد. اما من آن را می بینم
من فقط کمی گرسنه هستم و این مرا به سمت کمال سوق می دهد. وهمی
نه ، این گلوله است ژاکت
خوب ، چرا؟ وهمی
چون هست ژاکت
خوب ، آیا می توانم نمایشی از شما انجام دهم؟ وهمی
شماره یعقوب
چرا نه؟ وهمی
چون این را گفتم ژاکت
دیک هایدگر - یک سؤال اساسی مهم برای فراگیر او
سوال بودن - ارتباط بین هستی و
فکر کردن ماهیت آن رابطه چیست؟ چقدر از نزدیک انجام می شود
دو پدیده با هم تعلق دارند؟ یکی از این قطعات پارمنیدی به طور سنتی بوده است
ترجمه شده ، "برای فکر کردن و بودن یکسان است." اینجا هایدگر
این ترجمه را بازجویی می کند:
آیا این کلمه به ما پاسخ می دهد
در مورد اینکه چگونه تفکر متعلق به هستی است ، در آن
می گوید هر دو "یکسان" هستند؟ کلمه نه
جواب در وهله اول ، زیرا
MINATION "همان" از هر سؤالی جلوگیری می کند
درباره "تعلق به هم" ، که فقط می تواند
بین چیزهایی که متفاوت هستند وجود دارد. در
مقام دوم ، زیرا کلمه "همان"
در مورد دیدگاه اصلاً چیزی نمی گوید
از آن ، و به چه دلیلی تفاوت دارد
به یکنواختی منتقل می شود. بنابراین به خودکار ،
یکسان ، کلمه کلیدی مبهم برای هر دو باقی مانده است
قطعات - اگر نه برای کل پارمنیدها "
فکر (EGT 88)
"
هایدگر ما را در تاریکی اینجا ترک می کند ، زیرا او ما را می خواهد
آن اصطلاح مبهم را در مورد آن قرار دهید. او می خواهد ما را بشناسیم
تمایل ما به براق کردن ایده های چالش برانگیز با آسان و آشنا
تفسیرها:
البته اگر ما این عقیده را داشته باشیم
به طور خودکار ، همان ، به معنای "یکسان" است و اگر
ما "هویت" را کاملاً به عنوان بیشترین پذیرش می پذیریم
پیش فرض شفاف برای تفکر
از هر چیزی که قابل فکر باشد ، پس با این نظر
ما به تدریج ناشنوا تر می شویم
کلمه ، با فرض اینکه ما تاکنون آن را شنیده ایم
تماس با این حال ، حفظ کلمه کافی است
در دادرسی ما در چاراک تحریک کننده آن-
تر با انجام این کار ما همچنان شنوندگان هستیم. بشر بشر بشر (EGT 88)

شما هر کاری را انجام می دهید انجام می دهید ، و این داستان را اضافه می کنید که این مرا به سمت من سوق می دهد
کمال اما این شما را به سمت سوراخی در زمین سوق می دهد ، و آنها می خواهند شما را به داخل پرتاب کنند
این ، و آنها می خواهند خاک را در چهره شما پرتاب کنند. به آن فکر کنید ژاکت
بله ، بله این همان اتفاقی است که افتاد وهمی
نه ، این اتفاق خواهد افتاد. ژاکت
بله ، وقتی به آنجا می روم این همان اتفاقی خواهد افتاد. من فکر نمی کنم داستانی به زندگی خود اضافه کنم
برای جالب توجه یا سرگرم کننده. من فکر نمی کنم زندگی خود را با تثبیت رنگ آمیزی کنم. فقط برای ساختن آن
جالب درز
شما تا زمانی که "فقط برای جالب شدن آن" اضافه کنید ، در حال انجام fi ne بود.

یا سرگرم کننده درز
یا "فقط برای سرگرمی آن". داستان "برای سرگرمی." این وحشتناک است ژاکت
بله ، بله درز
هدف داستان داستان است. ژاکت
بله ، بله درز
چه چیزی سرگرم کننده تر از یک درخت است؟ هیچی ایستاده در مقابل یک درخت: هیچ چیز نمی تواند باشد
سرگرم کننده تر از ایستادن در مقابل یک درخت. ژاکت
بنابراین وقتی آنچه را که اتفاق افتاده است ، باید معنای اتوماتیک بدون آن اضافه شود
مجبور به بازی ویولن ... erhard
معنایی برای آن وجود ندارد. درخت به معنای چیزی نیست. این فقط یک درخت است ما پیشنهاد کرده ایم که یک رابطه اساسی بین
تجربه برانگیخته در آموزش EST و در دسترس است
انجمن ؛ و ما گفتیم که هیچ تجربه ای در
سخنان گفتاری از مکالمات ، اما این که هر دو ابلاغ می شوند
در متن ناگفته آن کلمات. هایدگر به همین ترتیب کارگردانی می کند
ما باید شخصیت متن را در نظر بگیریم. اگر انسانهای مدرن
آیا با نوشتن پیش از گفتگوی متفکرانه شرکت می کنند
سقراط - و هایدگر چنین گفتگو را برای این امر بسیار مهم می داند
لحظه ای در تاریخ - آنگاه ما باید در تفکر خود شروع به دستگیری کنیم
"کلیت یکپارچه منیفولد" (EGT 22). گفتگو با تفکر اولیه یونانی میوه خواهد بود-
فقط وقتی چنین گوش دادن اتفاق می افتد کامل است. مناسب است
برای گفتگو که گفتگوی آن از
همان چیز ؛ در واقع این که از شرطی صحبت می کند
pation در همان. (EGT 22)
"
بیش از حد وسیع زمان و زبان ، آنچه می شنویم می تواند
همان چیزی باشید که متفکران یونانی می گویند؟ توسعه
این سوال ، هایدگر گذرگاهی از پیش سکوراتیک قرار می دهد
متفکر پارمنیدس در کنار یکی از تفکر مدرن
فیلسوف ، نیچه ، و این مشاهدات را در مورد
مخلوط کردن:
قطعه باستانی تفکر اولیه غربی
و قطعه اواخر فکر اخیر غربی-
همین مسئله را به زبان می آورد ، اما آنچه آنها هستند
بگو یکسان نیست. با این حال ، جایی که می توانیم
از نظر چیزهایی که هستند از همان صحبت کنید
یکسان نیست ، وضعیت اساسی a
گفتگوی متفکرانه بین اخیر و اوایل
بارها به طور خودکار برآورده می شود. بشر بشر بشر [G] Ranting

این به این دلیل است که شما آن را انجام می دهید. شما این کار را در اینجا توجیه می کنید وقتی که ما را به دیدن اینکه شما این کار را انجام می دهید
با گفتن من این کار را می کنم تا خودم را سرگرم کنم. اما شما این کار را نمی کنید. و شما انجام نمی دهید

شماره erhard
آیا تا به حال کاری انجام داده اید که دوست ندارید انجام دهید؟ ژاکت
بله بنابراین می توانیم بگوییم ، به این معنا که هایدگر متمایز است
در اینجا ، که آموزش EST و انجمن یکسان هستند اما نه
یکسان علاوه بر این ، ما نیز می توانیم بگوییم که همان رابطه
بین "فکر مجرد" تفکر هایدگر و
تجربه تحول آمیز در انجمن برانگیخته است. هایدگر بیشتر تمایز "همان" را در یک
بحث در مورد آرم ها ، سایتی که موجودات در آن ظاهر می شوند
دنیای معنا ، جمع شده و پناه می برند. اگرچه در
آرمهای غربی به طور سنتی به عنوان گفتمان یا گفتاری ترجمه می شوند
زبان - و برای هایدگر ، البته ، زبان قلمرو است
بودن - اصطلاح ریشه ، لژین ، در درجه اول نشانگر صحبت کردن نیست ،
اما به معنای دراز کشیدن ، قبل از دراز کشیدن است. گفتن لژین است. این جمله ، اگر خوب فکر شود ،
اکنون همه چیز را از هر چیز آسان ، تریت و خالی دور می کند
uous این رمز و راز غیرقابل توصیف است که
صحبت از زبان می آید از
عدم پذیرش آنچه موجود است. (EGT 64)
گفتن و صحبت کردن اساساً به عنوان اجازه-
قبل از همه چیزهایی که در آن قرار داده شده است
عدم حضور ، به وجود می آید. (EGT 63)

یک سوال اصلی برای هایدگر مربوط به حقیقت a است
بودن - موجود بودن - در مورد ظهور آن
به جهان چگونه می توانیم خود را درک کنیم ، فیزیک
لحظه اولین گلدهی آن به معنی ، اما قبل از آن
از تحریف نظر و دیدگاه منحرف می شود؟ در
هایدگر در این مورد بسیار بازتابنده می گوید: قلب موضوع می گوید
گذر ، امکان باز بودن در اجازه دادن و به همین ترتیب است:
قبل از ما همانطور که قبل از دروغ گفتن. این را به عنوان ایجاد می کند
خود یک و یکسان در یک قرار می گیرد. یکی می کند
به همان اندازه چنین لژین یک و یکسان است ،
امون چنین لژین Omologein است: یکی به عنوان

قبل از ما ، در خودخواهی آن جمع شده است
قبل از دروغ (EGT 66)

شما کاری را که انجام می دهید انجام می دهید ، و به طور تصادفی گاهی اوقات با داستانی که در مورد چه چیزی دارید مطابقت دارد
شما دوست دارید انجام دهید و آنچه شما را احمق می کند این است که بگویید ، "وقتی من خوب هستم آنچه را که دوست دارم انجام دهم و
وقتی من بد هستم ، کاری را انجام می دهم که دوست ندارم انجام دهم. " نه. وقتی بد هستید بد هستید و چه زمانی هستید
خوب شما خوب هستید و آن را با همه آن نعل اسب فلسفی لعنتی نکنید. این همان چیزی است که او
