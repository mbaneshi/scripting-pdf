Forum Day Three: Session Three 223
ERHARD
Yeah.
BETH
That I don’t take risks.
ERHARD
So what?
BETH
So what? I know...
ERHARD
I asked you fi rst. So what “you avoid risks”? 
BETH
Yeah.
ERHARD
You avoid risks. You made that into some kind of crummy meaning. You know what? You 
avoid risks. Okay. You turned it into a soap opera. You made it mean something. You put 
violins in the back, and turned it into some meaning. What does it mean that you avoid risks? 
It doesn’t mean anything. Rocks are hard. You know what that means? Nothing. They’re just 
hard. You avoid risks. What does that mean? Nothing. I’m getting older. What does that mean? 
Nothing. I didn’t succeed in life. What does that mean? Nothing. I had a divorce. What does 
that mean? Nothing... but I had two divorces. What does that mean? Two nothings. But I’m 
not worthy. So what you’re not worthy? You’re going to make a federal case out of it? You’re 
not worthy. I got that. Now what? You want to make something out of it. It does not mean 
anything! It’s meaningless. Does it mean something that rocks are hard? What about the 
spirits-in the-rocks shit? More fucking voodoo. 
(laughter)
Voodoo! You avoid risks. I got it. “Oh, but you don’t understand.” What you mean is, I don’t 
get all the meaning and drama and turmoil and soap opera and the sadness and upset. You’re 
right. I don’t get that. That’s your crap. What I get is that you avoid intimacy. I got that. Rocks 
are hard. Water’s wet. And you avoid intimacy. And each one of those has an equal amount of 
signifi cance. But you made a big deal out of avoiding intimacy. Turned it into a whole fucking 
soap opera. You know, it’s back and forth. Sometimes Beth resists that and tries to be intimate. 
And sometimes she succumbs to it and gives up the attempt to be intimate. She changes so that 
she’s more intimate. Is that getting clearer?
BETH
Yeah. I’m going to take a risk.
