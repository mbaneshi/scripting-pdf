Forum Day Two: Session One

MARSHA
Yeah, because I want relationships with people, and I canâ€™t get close.
ERHARD
Listen up here, because most of you are not going to have the courage for this. So you need
to get it from those who do have the courage. That thereâ€™s something sad for her about being
angryâ€”thatâ€™s why sheâ€™s afraid she might be angry, then itâ€™s all mashed in with being close.
Convoluted in a knot.
MARSHA
My whole life has been an act about being happy and cheerful, giving and caring, getting every-
body to like me, and they do. The truth is that I donâ€™t have an enemy in the world.
ERHARD
Hold on for a second. So if youâ€™re a person who has the skills that Marsha has, the skills of be-
ing related to people well, and somehow thatâ€™s not nurturing her deeply and profoundly; thatâ€™s
not leaving her full of joy, because itâ€™s there in order for her not to be angry! Do you hear the
in-order-to? In order not to be angry?
Marsha remained standing while Erhard worked with several other participants.
ERHARD
So if Iâ€™m nice in order not to be angry, what persists? Youâ€™ve got to get clear on this. Whoâ€™s not
clear on this?
A participant named Mike stood.
ERHARD
So Mike, if I relate well, in order not to be angry, when I relate well, whatâ€™s always there is being
angry. Itâ€™s being there as something Iâ€™m resisting.
Erhard approached another participant, and did a demonstration in which each man grasped the
otherâ€™s hands and attempted to push the other away.
ERHARD
So if Iâ€™m resisting something, Iâ€™m attached to what Iâ€™m resisting. All this relating-well dances
around anger, is attached to anger. I never have any profound sense of being related, because
what persists under being related is being angry all the time. I donâ€™t have a deep sense of fulfi ll-
ment out of relating well, because what persists is being angry all the time. See, Iâ€™m not related
well in order to be related, Iâ€™m related well in order not to be angry. You ever notice that real
nice people, when you crack their shell a little bit, thereâ€™s a lot of dissatisfaction and sadness?
You know, thereâ€™s a lot of real nice people in here; all you got to do is crack the surface and then
thereâ€™s dissatisfaction. Is it starting to be clear?

SPEAKING BEING
MIKE
Just a bit. I see you pushing against this gentleman over here, and Iâ€™m understanding something
about anger. Youâ€™re saying, pushing it away, itâ€™s still there. Kind of fuzzy.
ERHARD
When I push him away, am I not attached to him?
MIKE
Youâ€™re touching him yes.
ERHARD
No, attached to him. I canâ€™t get away from him as Iâ€™m pushing him away, can I?
MIKE
No you canâ€™t.
ERHARD
So in a sense Iâ€™m attached to him, am I not?
MIKE
And youâ€™re doing the attaching.
ERHARD
Never mind who is doing the attaching.
Erhard returned to the other participant and had him hold Erhardâ€™s shoulders.
ERHARD
So, heâ€™s got me now, right? And I canâ€™t get away. Heâ€™s holding on to me, right?
MIKE
Right.
ERHARD
Whatâ€™s the diff erence between that and this?
Erhard pushed the participant as he did in the previous instance.
ERHARD
In terms of being attached? Whether John is holding on to me, or Iâ€™m pushing him away, we are
r
equally attached.
MIKE
Okay.
