Forum Day Four: Session One

JOYCE
Not liking yourself?
ERHARD
Yeah. Obvious, huh? You can’t have liking yourself without not liking yourself. Get rid of both 
of them. It’s a bullshit conversation. There’s nothing in there. It’s pure drama.
JOYCE
It’s arguing with yourself.
ERHARD
It’s like arguing if you’re blue or green. Are you blue or green?
JOYCE
I’m neither.
ERHARD
Absolutely. It’s like, are you likable or unlikable? It’s like asking you if you’re blue or green. 
It’s the same kind of question. Are you blue or green? It’s nonsense. It’s garbage, and if you 
ask garbage questions you get garbage answers. Every time someone likes theirself, what gets 
reinforced?
JOYCE
I don’t know.
ERHARD
Not liking theirself. Don’t you see that you can’t have a lot of liking yourself and just a little 
bit of not liking yourself? They got to be exactly even, because you can’t build liking yourself 
except in contrast to not liking yourself.
JOYCE
You’re saying to throw both of them away.
ERHARD
Yeah. This is a garbage question liking yourself/not liking yourself. Cut that out. Hold some-
body’s hand; look up at the sky; go make something happen: But don’t waste your time with the 
question of liking yourself or not liking yourself. That’s your racket. 
JOYCE  (weeping)
One of my rackets...
