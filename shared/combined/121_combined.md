Forum Day Two: Session One
107
MARSHA
That’s when I changed my name to Marsha. I wouldn’t answer to that other name any more.
And by the time I got to high school, there was a new group. The act was down great. It worked.
I was class vice president. I became popular on a diff erent...
ERHARD
Not quite right, though, still popular; popular enough to avoid being unpopular. Your identity
got built when the issue was popularity.
(to the group)
You got put together for the purpose of dealing with issues like popularity.
MARSHA
As years went by, I got it down good that I won homecoming queen in college; student body
president; president of the sorority: everything.
ERHARD
She’s now one of those kids you couldn’t be that you thought had it all together. She was the
popular kids: the in-crowd; the one who whispered behind your back. These were the people
who were really happy, not like you.
Erhard stopped to address a participant sitting down, who remained seated, without a microphone,
and who shook her head in response to each of Erhard’s questions.
ERHARD (continuing)
Is this hitting close to home? Popularity wasn’t your thing? What did you care? You have a chip
on your shoulder? If I asked your friends if you had a chip on your shoulder, what would they
tell me? I know you can’t think for them, but what do you think they would say? Think about it.
I’ll be back.
(laughter; to Marsha)
You were saying?
MARSHA
I’ve got six children, a wonderful husband: I arrange everything.
ERHARD
You generate the family. You source the family.
MARSHA
But I am so thin and my body can’t do it anymore.
THE THEY-SELF
Throughout his work, Werner Erhard has proposed that the fun-
damental purpose for human beings in our current Cartesian
paradigm—their design function—is the survival of the self; and
that just as survival for a biological organism requires food and water,
108
SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Listen carefully. What Marsha’s telling you doesn’t belong to her. That bullshit is all over the
place. It’s a rainstorm. It’s all over the place: that bullshit about being stretched too thin. You
ain’t ever going to be big enough to operate in a way that doesn’t leave you unnurtured and too
thin. You’re going to die disappointed, because you aren’t ever going to accomplish enough to be
fulfi lled when accomplishment is there in-order-to. All you’re doing is building dissatisfaction that
accomplishment is designed to avoid. It looks like a big pile of satisfaction. I mean, here’s a wom-
an who was successful as an older child; successful in college. Extraordinarily successful raising
six children, married to a great guy: and it’s making her “thin.” It makes you thin when those
accomplishments are in-order-to. It ought to be making her “thicker” not “thinner.” They make
you thinner when they’re not fulfi lling, when they’re not enlivening, when they’re a strategy.
(to Marsha)
What else?
MARSHA
Here I am today.
ERHARD
You’re in the right place.
(applause)
You aren’t going to be around that much honesty for the most part. What you and I did yes-
terday was put together a structure in which it is possible to be honest. You need to develop a
language for honesty. You can’t be honest in everyday language. It’s not designed for honesty.
You and I have been building a structure of distinctions designed for honesty. So you and I have
been building a language, a set of distinctions, building a structure where it is possible to be
honest. You’ve got to be a big person to be authentic about your inauthenticity. Being authentic
about your inauthenticity gives you being big. There’s no “big” inside of Marsha. No qualities
in there. What you and I describe as “qualities” arise in the moment of action. Someone who is
authentic about their own inauthenticity is giving themselves being big. Is that clear to you?
(returning to participant who remained seated without a mic)
There are no big people in here, because people are neither big nor small. They’re just people.
And when you’re authentic about your inauthenticity, it gives you being big. If she already had
the quality in there, that would be like being tall. If big were inside us, there wouldn’t be any-
thing very interesting about that, would there? Big arises in the acting. On the common sense
view, what would it occur to you to do with your inauthenticity? Hide it. Stamp it out. Change
it. Fix it. Repair it. The way you already always are about your inauthenticity is something
across the spectrum from fi x it, not-be-it, shove it down, across the spectrum to hide it. The idea
to share it would never occur to you. The idea to dump it on others might occur to you because
of the idea you’ve got called “friends.” It’s pure crap, what you tell your friends, pure crap. Be-
cause what do you tell your friends? The story. They have no respect for you so they sympathize
with you. They think you’re crap, just the same as you do, and that’s sad. And the appropriate
for an ontological entity, such as a human identity, the essential
survival requirements are being right and looking good, which
together justify and maintain whatever way we wound up being.
Both of these elements are addressed here during the second
day of The Forum. Being right is proposed as one of the primary
payoff s in the structure of a racket; and the discussion of looking
good grows out of the assignment given at the end of the first day,
when participants were told to locate the places in their life where
they were being “used by looking good.” Both of these distinctions
are essential elements of the model Erhard is creating in order to
deconstruct our Cartesian understanding and reveal the clearing
for a new possibility of being human.
Heidegger has likewise proposed a structure for understand-
ing human Being (Dasein) in terms of its domination by a concern
for the opinions of others. His rubric for this structure is das Man.
In the standard translation of Being and Time, this phrase is ren-
dered as the “they,” and here Heidegger describes the situation:
“
[Dasein] itself is not; its Being has been taken
away by the Others. . . . These Others, more-
over, are not definite Others. On the contrary,
any Other can represent them. What is de-
cisive is just that inconspicuous domination
by Others which has already been taken over
unawares from Dasein as Being-with. . . . The
“who” is not this one, not that one, not one-
self, not some people, and not the sum of them
all. The ‘who’ is the neuter, the “they.y ” (BT 164)
Hubert Dreyfus proposes that to translate das Man in this way
suggests that I am to be distinguished from them. But the point is
that the “they” has taken me over, so that in being dominated by
the “they” I am one of them. Therefore Dreyfus prefers the trans-
lation “the One”; that is, we don’t conform to the norms because
“they” do it, but because “it’s what one does” (BITW 151–152).
W
Says Heidegger: “In this inconspicuousness and unascertainability,
the real dictatorship of the ‘they’ is unfolded” (BT 164). As a result,
T
Dasein loses itself in the ways of Being of the “they,” and the Self of
everyday Dasein becomes the they-self.

response to that is sympathy. Awww, you poor thing. Marsha, thank you very much. And you
want to be clear that when Marsha sits down some of what didn’t resolve for her while she was
standing up, although she was pretty complete about that, the rest of that will resolve for her.
See it’s like a house of cards: when you take one of the cards out, the whole thing falls down.
That whole thing that’s tied together begins to break apart. There’s more attached to that, that
Marsha didn’t tell us. She hasn’t looked all the way through it, and doesn’t want to be up there
for a half hour telling the whole thing. She already gave you one insight. Anger was related to
“people don’t like me.” And “I’m angry at people for not liking me.” So you fi nd the anger and
see that what’s attached to that is “people don’t like me.” And what’s attached to that is I’ve got
to be likeable, and then you get really good at being likeable. Not in some cheap sense, not with
smoke and mirrors; earned like. She produced the results, earned the contribution. Put out the
energy. And she’s gotten really good at it.
(moving among the participants on the fl oor)
The problem is that when it’s there in order to avoid not being liked, about which I’m angry...
Accomplishment doesn’t leave you nurtured. That’s why they have happy hours after work. The
way people relate to their job, accomplishment in their job doesn’t nurture them.
(turning to a participant who had been standing the entire time)
JODIE
Interesting how much things have changed since I stood up.
ERHARD
Amazing, right?
JODIE
Looking good rules my life: completely and utterly.
ERHARD
If you haven’t seen yet that looking good owns your life... if you haven’t seen that yet... I prom-
ise you that that’s the case. You may not have seen it yet. So you don’t know that it is the case.
Like I said, I don’t know the truth, but I’m also not a guy in a diner about this, not a guy with
an opinion. If you haven’t seen this you want to be listening up. Like Mike and I were saying,
you want to listen to this like a possibility...that when Jodie’s fi nished, you want to stand in the
possibility that you don’t own your life, that your life doesn’t belong to you. Yeah, you’ve got
this arrogant façade that you run your life and call the shots. Listen to Jodie’s sharing out of this
possibility: to see how your life is shaped by looking good. And the quality of your life is that
of a life devoted to looking good. Your actions are limited to the span of action being given by
looking good. Stand in that possibility when Jodie is fi nished.
JODIE
What also came up from yesterday when you talked about concept and experience and rein-
forcing each other, my whole life is, that I’ve got to look good and if I don’t look good it doesn’t
Heidegger specifies other characteristics of the “they” which
thereby become aspects of our everydayness. First, because we
generally encounter others in the context of our everyday con-
cerns—the competitive environment of the workplace, as well as
the social and political realms—we experience “constant care as
to the way one diff ers from them, whether one’s own Dasein has
lagged behind the Others and wants to catch up in relationship
to them, or whether one’s Dasein has priority over them and sets
out to keep them suppressed” (BT 164–165). As this complex of
T
concerns takes Dasein over, the withness of Being-with-Others is
interrupted:
“
The care about this distance between them is
disturbing to Being-with-one-another, though
this disturbance is one that is hidden from
it. If we may express this existentially, such
Being-with-one-another has the character of
distantiality. (BT 164)
Further, since the “they” is everyone and no one, it is characterized
as well by averageness:
“
Thus the “they” maintains itself factically
in the averageness of that which belongs to
it, of that which it regards as valid and that
which it does not, and of that to which it grants
success and that to which it denies it. In this
averageness with which it prescribes what
can and may be ventured, it keeps watch over
everything exceptional that thrusts itself to
the fore. Every kind of priority gets noiseless-
ly suppressed. Overnight, everything that is
primordial gets glossed over as something that
has long been well known. Everything gained
by a struggle becomes just something to be
manipulated. Every secret loses its force. This
care of averageness reveals in turn an essential
tendency of Dasein which we call the “levelling
down” of all possibilities of Being. (BT 165)
110
SPEAKING BEING
come off  well, and that reinforces that I’ve got to look good. And it just goes
around and around.
ERHARD
So when you don’t look good, it reinforces looking good, and when you do
look good, that reinforces looking good.
JODIE
And that there’s been times in my life where, that looking good prevents me
from expressing what I want to express. I could go home to my intimate rela-
tionship and I could go home alone and say “okay, at least I look good.”
ERHARD
Yeah. Listen. Your little $625, that’s chicken shit compared to what you just
got from her. You can’t buy that kind of honesty. That’s more insight than most
people are ever going to have in their entire life. What she told you is that you
don’t own your life.  Looking good owns your life. And life is not about self-ex-
pression. You now know why there’s no satisfaction in your success. Looking
good is gratifying, but not fulfi llment. You notice it’s never enough. Nothing is
ever enough. Nothing. Nothing leaves you whole and complete, nothing leaves
you full of joy. Because that’s not the name of the game. The name of the
game is looking good. It’s the only game in town. You are not living life. You
are looking good. Of course, some people look good by looking bad. A lot of
people look good by being the victim. For example, if you screw up someplace
when you’re a kid and get a lot of attention. People who are unable. It’s a way
of life. There’s an organ for some people called dealing with electrical things,
and they don’t have that organ, you see.
(laughter)
Not long ago they burned women to death in Scotland as a favor because their
souls were possessed. The best people in the community applied the tests to
see if a woman’s soul was possessed by a devil. A lot of what you know to
be true is in the same order as what those Scots knew that led them to burn
women to death. One of those things that isn’t true is that you own your life,
because you don’t. One of those things that isn’t true is that you’re free, but
you’re not. You’re owned by looking good.
JODIE
For me what happened was I was unattractive as a child. I was 5 feet 8 inches
at 12 years old. I always stood out in a crowd, was gawky and all that. Always
popular with the girls and never with the boys. Unattractive all the way through
high school. And when I was 17 the transformation took place. I lost 35 pounds,
got contact lenses and a professional haircut. All of a sudden men liked me.
What showed up for me was that when I was young men didn’t like me.
Collectively, these ways of being—distantiality, averageness, and
levelling down—constitute what Heidegger calls “Publicness,”
which
“
controls every way in which the world and Da-
sein get interpreted, and it is always right—not
because there is some distinctive and primary
relationship-of-Being in which it is related
to ‘Things,’ or because it avails itself of some
transparency on the part of Dasein which it
has explicitly appropriated, but because it is
insensitive to every diff erence of level and of
genuineness and thus never gets to the ‘heart
of the matter.’ (BT 165, emphasis added)
Finally, although all of this would seem to paint an unrelieved-
ly bleak picture for Dasein’s possibility of Being-in-the-world, there
is one more element that, at first glance, might seem to provide
some relief, and might (initially at least) be called “the upside of
the they-self.” In Werner Erhard’s model, it is in fact one of the
“payoff s” in the structure of a racket:
“
[B]ecause the “they” presents every judgment
and decision as its own, it deprives the particu-
lar Dasein of its answerability. The “they” can,
as it were, manage to have ‘them’ constantly
invoking it. . . . It ‘was’ always the “they” who
did it, and yet it can be said that it has been
‘no one.’ . . . .Thus the particular Dasein in its
everydayness is disburdened by the “they.” Not
only that; by thus disburdening it of its Being,
the “they” accommodates Dasein if Dasein has
any tendency to take things easily and make
them easy. (BT 165)
And what Dasein wouldn’t want to make things easy? Avoidance
of responsibility for one’s situation, and off -loading of blame
JODIE (continuing)
Forum Day Two: Session One
111
ERHARD
Now is that true? Did that ever happen? “Men don’t like me?” Is it true “I’m not attractive”? Is
that true? Could that be true? Who said yes? “Not attractive” could happen? Stand up. I want
you to tell me how that could happen.
SAM
I could make it up that I’m not attractive.
ERHARD
Oh, that’s a story. “Not attractive” can’t happen. Did you ever wonder, “that guy is so unattractive.
How did he ever get that woman? She must be blind.” Do you know that attraction is the weirdest
stuff  in the universe? Everybody’s attractive. A lot of people don’t troll their bait, that’s all. So if
your story is that “I’m tall and gawky and not attractive,” you don’t have your bait out. I would be
willing to bet that there isn’t anybody for whom there are no fi sh, given what I’ve seen. You begin
to live out of a story that you’re not attractive. Don’t tell me there are no fi sh if you’re not trolling.
(to Jodie)
You were saying?
JODIE
So I got attractive. And I know that I can walk into a room and every man will look at me.
That’s happened for me.
ERHARD
Nothing’s changed about being tall, right? Tall is now attractive. Same stuff . I want to get this
clear with you. You gotta get this.
Erhard walked to the blackboard, and drew two circles. One circle he labeled “attractive,” one he
labeled “not attractive.” He wrote “tall” in both.
(continuing)
The way things are is not determined by the way things are. That’s hard to think, so that’s what
I’m asking you to think. The way things are is determined by the context in which things occur.
t
I’m wanting you to begin to see that this part—the circle, the context—is critically important.
I’m saying that the circumstances never produce problems. I don’t care what happened in your
r
life. That’s not the problem. I don’t care if you were raped when you were a little girl or you
were molested when you were a little boy. I don’t care who’s sitting there with cancer. I know
you think that did something bad to you. I’m saying no. The circumstances never are the prob-
lem. Tall occurs as not attractive in one context, in one domain of existence, and tall occurs as
attractive in another domain of existence. Anybody not get that? It’s never what happened that’s
the problem. I don’t care what’s happened in your life. That is not the problem. The problem is
the context in which “what happened” occurred.
(to Jodie)
Yes, you were saying...
onto someone or something else whom you can make wrong, is
a significant payoff  of one’s racket, a distinction that has been
mentioned several times but will not be distinguished until the
next session.
Aside from the payoff , the structure of a racket has another
element: the cost. And here Heidegger names it: “[B]ecause the
‘they’ constantly accommodates the particular Dasein by disbur-
dening it of its Being, the ‘they’ retains and enhances its stubborn
dominion” (BT 165). Through its surrender to the domination of
T
the “they,” Dasein has embraced the Cartesian security of being
right in its averageness; but it has at the same time sacrificed its
freedom and power. As The Forum participant Jodie states, “look-
ing good rules my life.”
In these “characters of Being,” says Heidegger, we find “the
‘constancy’ of Dasein which is closest to us” (BT 166). Certainly, the
T
attitudes and behaviors he has presented here are familiar to all
of us—and if we can’t quite recognize them in ourselves, we can
certainly recognize them in others, or in the culture at large. And
we must feel some discomfort in acknowledging that his descrip-
tions are so apt.
But straight talk about the way things look now is the essen-
tial first step in gaining a new perspective; and in The Forum, the
creation of a new possibility must be preceded by a hard look at
our present way of Being. Heidegger takes us through the steps
one at a time.
“
Neither the Self of one’s own Dasein nor the
Self of the Other has as yet found itself or lost
itself as long as it is in the modes we have
mentioned. In these modes one’s way of Being
is that of inauthenticity and failure to stand
by one’s Self. (BT 166)
Confronting the reality of the they-self responds to the first question
of The Forum: “What is the Being of human being?” Authenticity
and taking a stand become available when the second is addressed:
“What is the possibility of Being for human being?” ■
112
SPEAKING BEING
JODIE
When I was a child, I was not liked by boys. That’s my story...
ERHARD
Or boys didn’t say certain things to you. That’s what happened. And boys didn’t act in certain
ways with you. There’s a thousand possible stories: “I was so awesome that those twerps didn’t
have the balls to say to me what they said to those little girls.”
JODIE
That’s what I say now.
ERHARD
All I’m trying to point out is that a story is just a story. The “what happened,” that’s what’s true
or not. It did or it didn’t. Mostly true. Because she wouldn’t have even noticed boys not saying
or acting a certain way unless her listening was “boys don’t like me.” If your listening is that
somebody doesn’t like you, everything they say is an expression of not liking you. If we pushed
Jodie hard enough she could go back and remember that “oh yeah, one of them was trying to be
nice to me once.” Something like that.
JODIE
So I got attractive and, men asked me out. What I fi nd now is that as an adolescent I believed
that men didn’t like me, so when I got attractive it was like a shell I was putting on.
ERHARD
This is good. I got to stop you because they are listening like this is a soap opera and they need
to listen deeply.
(to the group)
If you’re attractive to make up for not being attractive... if who you really are is unattractive, but
they don’t know that, every time you are attractive, what you are left with is being unattractive.
When you change unattractive to attractive, what persists is unattractive. It’s a con game, under-
neath which is unattractive. There’s no object that has the quality “attractive.” There’s no being
fulfi lled in being attractive. There’s stuff  in my house I think is wonderful, the dog walks right by.
JODIE
When someone tells me “You’re really beautiful,” what comes up for me is “but you don’t
really know me.” When I go home I take this off  and there’s the real me and you won’t like that
person.
ERHARD
Here’s what you want to get: nobody wants to know that about themselves. Nobody wants to
get that really underneath it all they’re really unattractive. That’s why you paid $625. Because
in here, it’s structured so you can get at that—to the degree that Jodie can be with this, and she
“
All I’m trying to point out is that a story is just
a story. The “what happened,” that’s what’s
true or not. It did or it didn’t. Mostly true.

مارشا
این زمانی است که من نام خود را به مارشا تغییر دادم. من دیگر به آن نام دیگر پاسخ نمی دهم. و تا زمانی که به دبیرستان رسیدم ، یک گروه جدید وجود داشت. این عمل عالی بود. کار کرد من معاون رئیس جمهور کلاس بودم. من در مورد یک چیز مختلف محبوب شدم ... erhard
کاملاً درست نیست ، اما هنوز هم محبوب است. به اندازه کافی محبوب برای جلوگیری از غیرقانونی بودن. هویت شما
وقتی مسئله محبوبیت بود ساخته شد. (به گروه)
شما به منظور مقابله با موضوعاتی مانند محبوبیت کنار هم قرار گرفتید. مارشا
با گذشت سالها ، من خوب شدم که در کالج Queen Homecoming برنده شدم. بدن دانشجویی
رئیس جمهور رئیس جمهور Sorority: همه چیز. درز
او اکنون یکی از آن بچه هایی است که شما نمی توانید باشید که فکر می کردید همه اینها را با هم داشته باشید. او بود
بچه های محبوب: در جمع ؛ کسی که پشت شما زمزمه کرد. اینها مردم بودند
که واقعاً خوشحال بودند ، مثل شما. Erhard متوقف شد تا به یک شرکت کننده نشسته ، که نشسته است ، بدون میکروفون ، متوقف شود.
و چه کسی در پاسخ به سؤالات هر یک از ارهارد سر خود را تکان داد. erhard (ادامه)
آیا این ضربه نزدیک به خانه است؟ محبوبیت چیز شما نبود؟ به چه چیزی اهمیت دادی؟ شما یک تراشه دارید
روی شانه شما؟ اگر از دوستانتان پرسیدم که آیا شما یک تراشه روی شانه خود دارید ، آنها چه می کردند
به من بگو؟ من می دانم که شما نمی توانید برای آنها فکر کنید ، اما فکر می کنید آنها چه می گویند؟ به آن فکر کنید من برمی گردم (خنده ؛ به مارشا)
می گفتی؟ مارشا
من شش فرزند دارم ، یک شوهر فوق العاده: من همه چیز را ترتیب می دهم. درز
شما خانواده را تولید می کنید. شما به خانواده منبع می دهید. مارشا
اما من خیلی نازک هستم و بدنم دیگر نمی تواند این کار را انجام دهد. آنها خودشان
در طول کار خود ، ورنر ارهارد پیشنهاد کرده است که سرگرم کننده-

این دقیقاً همانطور که بقا برای یک ارگانیسم بیولوژیکی نیاز به غذا و آب دارد ،

وجود
درز
با دقت گوش دهید آنچه ما مارشا به شما می گوید متعلق به او نیست. آن زورگویی در سراسر
مکان این یک طوفان باران است در همه جا قرار دارد: آن زورگویی در مورد کشش بیش از حد نازک است. شما
هرگز به اندازه کافی بزرگ نخواهد بود که به شکلی کار کند که شما را غیرقانونی نمی کند
نازک شما می خواهید ناامید شوید ، زیرا هرگز نمی خواهید به اندازه کافی انجام دهید
هنگامی که موفقیت در آنجا وجود دارد ، انجام می شود. تمام کاری که شما انجام می دهید ایجاد نارضایتی است که
موفقیت برای جلوگیری از آن طراحی شده است. به نظر می رسد یک تکه بزرگ رضایت است. منظورم این است که در اینجا یک زن است
کسی که به عنوان یک کودک بزرگتر موفق بود ؛ موفق در کالج. افزایش فوق العاده موفق
شش فرزند ، با یک پسر بزرگ ازدواج کردند: و او را "نازک" می کند. این باعث می شود شما نازک شوید
دستاوردها به صورت سفارش هستند. این باید "ضخیم تر" او را "نازک تر" کند. آنها می سازند
وقتی آنها یک استراتژی هستند ، وقتی که آنها زنده نمی شوند ، نازک تر می شوید. (به مارشا)
چه چیز دیگری؟ مارشا
اینجا من امروز هستم. درز
شما در جای مناسب هستید (تشویق)
شما نمی خواهید در بیشتر قسمت ها صداقت زیادی داشته باشید. آنچه شما و من انجام دادیم بله-
Terday ساختاری را که در آن می توان صادقانه بود ، جمع کرد. شما باید توسعه دهید
زبان برای صداقت. شما نمی توانید به زبان روزمره صادق باشید. این برای صداقت طراحی نشده است. من و شما در حال ساختن ساختاری از تمایزها هستیم که برای صداقت طراحی شده است. بنابراین من و شما داریم
در حال ساختن یک زبان ، مجموعه ای از تمایزها ، ساختن ساختاری که در آن امکان پذیر است
صادقانه شما باید یک فرد بزرگ باشید تا در مورد عدم صحت خود معتبر باشید. معتبر بودن
در مورد عدم اطمینان شما به شما بزرگ می شود. در داخل مارشا "بزرگ" وجود ندارد. بدون ویژگی
در آنجا آنچه شما و من به عنوان "خصوصیات" توصیف می کنیم در لحظه عمل ایجاد می شود. کسی که هست
معتبر بودن در مورد عدم اعتماد به نفس خود ، به خود بزرگ می شود. آیا این برای شما روشن است؟ (بازگشت به شرکت کننده که بدون میکروفون نشسته است)
در اینجا افراد بزرگی وجود ندارد ، زیرا مردم نه بزرگ و نه کوچک هستند. آنها فقط مردم هستند و هنگامی که در مورد عدم اطمینان خود معتبر هستید ، به شما بزرگ می شود. اگر او قبلاً داشت
کیفیت در آنجا ، این مانند قد بلند بودن است. اگر بزرگ در درون ما بود ، وجود نخواهد داشت
آیا در مورد آن بسیار جالب است ، آیا وجود دارد؟ بزرگ در بازیگری بوجود می آید. روی عقل سلیم
مشاهده ، چه کاری برای شما اتفاق می افتد که با عدم اعتماد به نفس خود انجام دهید؟ مخفی کردنش تمبر آن را. تغییر
آن آن را برطرف کنید. تعمیر آن روشی که قبلاً در مورد عدم اطمینان خود هستید چیزی است
در طول طیف از fi x it ، نه ، آن را به سمت پایین ، در سراسر طیف برای مخفی کردن آن قرار دهید. ایده
برای به اشتراک گذاشتن آن هرگز برای شما اتفاق نمی افتد. ایده ریختن آن بر دیگران ممکن است برای شما اتفاق بیفتد زیرا
از ایده ای که شما "دوستان" خوانده اید. این تله خالص است ، آنچه شما به دوستان خود می گویید ، تله ناب. be-
چون به دوستان خود چه می گویید؟ داستان آنها هیچ احترامی به شما ندارند بنابراین همدردی می کنند
با شما آنها فکر می کنند شما تله ای هستید ، دقیقاً مانند شما ، و این ناراحت کننده است. و مناسب
برای یک موجود هستی شناختی ، مانند هویت انسانی ، ضروری است
الزامات بقا درست و خوب به نظر می رسد ، که
با هم به هر روشی که وجود داشته باشیم ، توجیه و حفظ می کنیم. هر دوی این عناصر در طی دوم در اینجا خطاب می شوند
روز انجمن درست بودن به عنوان یکی از اصلی پیشنهاد می شود
بازپرداخت در ساختار یک راکت ؛ و بحث در مورد نگاه کردن
خوب از تکالیف داده شده در پایان روز اول رشد می کند ،
وقتی به شرکت کنندگان گفته شد مکانهای زندگی خود را پیدا کنند
آنها "با نگاه خوب" مورد استفاده قرار می گرفتند. هر دوی این تمایزها
عناصر اساسی مدل Erhard به منظور ایجاد
درک دکارتی ما را از بین ببرید و پاکسازی را فاش کنید
برای احتمال جدید انسان بودن. هایدگر نیز به همین ترتیب ساختاری را برای درک پیشنهاد داده است-
از نظر مسلط بودن انسان (dasein) از نظر یک نگرانی
برای نظرات دیگران موضوع او برای این ساختار Das Man است. در ترجمه استاندارد هستی و زمان ، این عبارت دوباره است
به عنوان "آنها" ، و در اینجا هایدگر وضعیت را توصیف می کند:
"
[dasein] خود نیست ؛ موجود آن گرفته شده است
دور توسط دیگران. بشر بشر بشر این دیگران ، بیشتر-
بیش از این ، دیگران قطعی نیستند. برعکس ،
هر دیگری می تواند آنها را نمایندگی کند. چیست
cisive فقط آن سلطه ناآگاهانه است
توسط دیگران که قبلاً به دست گرفته شده است
غافل از Dasein به عنوان موجود است. بشر بشر بشر در
"چه کسی" این یکی نیست ، نه آن ، نه
خود ، نه بعضی از افراد ، و نه جمع آنها
همه. "چه کسی" Neuter ، "آنها" (Bt 164)
هوبرت دریفوس پیشنهاد می کند که برای ترجمه Das Man از این طریق
پیشنهاد می کند که من باید از آنها متمایز شوم. اما نکته این است
که "آنها" مرا به دست گرفته است ، به طوری که در آن تحت سلطه
"آنها" من یکی از آنها هستم. بنابراین dreyfus ترجیح می دهد
"یکی" ؛ یعنی ما با هنجارها مطابقت نداریم زیرا
"آنها" این کار را انجام می دهند ، اما به این دلیل که "این همان کاری است که انجام می دهد" (Bitw 151-152). حرف
هایدگر می گوید: "در این ناخوشایند بودن و غیرقابل اطمینان ،
دیکتاتوری واقعی "آنها" آشکار می شوند "(BT 164). در نتیجه ،
حرف
داسین خود را در راه های "آنها" و خود از دست می دهد
هر روز داسین به خودشان تبدیل می شود. روز اول انجمن: جلسه یک

پاسخ به آن همدردی است. awww ، شما چیز ضعیف مارشا ، خیلی ممنون و تو
می خواهم واضح باشم که وقتی مارشا برخی از آنچه را که برای او حل نشده بود ، نشسته است
ایستادن ، اگرچه او در این باره کاملاً کامل بود ، اما بقیه آن برای او حل می شود. این مانند یک خانه کارت است: وقتی یکی از کارت ها را بیرون می آورید ، همه چیز از بین می رود. این همه چیز که به هم گره خورده اند شروع به تجزیه می کنند. بیشتر به آن متصل است ،
مارشا به ما نگفت. او تمام راه را از طریق آن نگاه نکرده است ، و نمی خواهد در آنجا باشد
به مدت نیم ساعت به همه چیز گفت. او در حال حاضر یک بینش به شما داده است. عصبانیت مربوط به
"مردم من را دوست ندارند." و "من از مردم عصبانی هستم که مرا دوست ندارند." بنابراین شما عصبانیت و
ببینید که آنچه به آن وصل شده است "مردم من را دوست ندارند". و آنچه به آن وابسته است این است که من دارم
دوست داشتن ، و سپس در دوست داشتن واقعاً خوب می شوید. نه به معنای ارزان ، نه با
دود و آینه ؛ مانند او نتایج را به دست آورد و سهم خود را بدست آورد. کنار گذاشتن
انرژی و او واقعاً خوب شده است. (حرکت در بین شرکت کنندگان در محل کار)
مشکل این است که وقتی در آنجا وجود دارد تا از دوست داشتن آن جلوگیری شود ، که در مورد آن عصبانی هستم ... موفقیت شما را پرورش نمی دهد. به همین دلیل آنها ساعتهای خوشی پس از کار دارند. در
راهی که مردم با شغل خود ارتباط دارند ، موفقیت در شغل خود آنها را پرورش نمی دهد. (روی آوردن به یک شرکت کننده که تمام وقت ایستاده بود)
جودی
جالب است که از زمان ایستادن چقدر اوضاع تغییر کرده است. درز
شگفت انگیز ، درست است؟ جودی
به نظر خوب قوانین زندگی من: کاملاً و کاملاً. درز
اگر هنوز ندیده اید که به نظر خوب زندگی شما است ... اگر هنوز آن را ندیده اید ... من تبلیغ می کنم
شما را که اینگونه است شاید هنوز آن را ندیده اید. بنابراین شما نمی دانید که این مورد است. همانطور که گفتم ، من حقیقت را نمی دانم ، اما من هم یک پسر در این موضوع نیستم ، نه یک پسر با
یک نظر اگر این را ندیده اید می خواهید گوش دهید. مثل مایک و من می گفتیم ،
شما می خواهید مانند یک احتمال به این گوش دهید ... این که وقتی جودی به وجود آمد ، می خواهید در آن بایستید
احتمال اینکه زندگی خود را نداشته باشید ، زندگی شما متعلق به شما نیست. بله ، شما دارید
این نمای متکبر که شما زندگی خود را اجرا می کنید و عکس ها را صدا می کنید. به اشتراک گذاری جودی گوش دهید
امکان: برای دیدن اینکه زندگی شما چگونه با نگاه خوب شکل می گیرد. و کیفیت زندگی شما این است
از زندگی اختصاص داده شده به نگاه خوب. اقدامات شما محدود به طول عمل است که توسط
خوب به نظر می رسد هنگامی که جودی در معرض دید قرار می گیرد ، در این امکان بایستید. جودی
آنچه از دیروز نیز به وجود آمد وقتی که شما در مورد مفهوم و تجربه صحبت کردید و دوباره
مجبور کردن یکدیگر ، تمام زندگی من این است که من باید خوب به نظر برسم و اگر خوب به نظر نمی رسم اینگونه نیست
هایدگر سایر خصوصیات "آنها" را مشخص می کند
بدین ترتیب به جنبه های روزمره ما تبدیل می شود. اول ، چون ما
به طور کلی با دیگران در زمینه روزمره ما روبرو می شوید
cerns - محیط رقابتی محیط کار ، و همچنین
قلمروهای اجتماعی و سیاسی - ما "مراقبت مداوم را تجربه می کنیم
به روشی که شخص از آنها تفاوت دارد ، خواه دازین شخصی خود داشته باشد
عقب مانده از دیگران و می خواهد در رابطه به عقب بیفتد
برای آنها ، یا اینکه آیا Dasein شخص اولویت دارد و مجموعه ها را تنظیم می کند
برای سرکوب آنها "(Bt 164-165). به عنوان این مجموعه از این مجموعه
حرف
نگرانی ها دزین را به دست می گیرد ، و با وجود افراد بودن
قطع شده:
"
مراقبت از این فاصله بین آنهاست
مزاحم بودن برای داشتن یک-یک دیگر ، هر چند
این آشفتگی یکی است که از آن پنهان شده است
آن اگر ممکن است این را به صورت وجودی بیان کنیم ، چنین
بودن با یک-یکی از شخصیت های دیگر
دور بودن (bt 164)
علاوه بر این ، از آنجا که "آنها" همه هستند و هیچ کس مشخص نمی شود
همچنین توسط میانگین:
"
بنابراین "آنها" به طور واقعی خود را حفظ می کنند
در میانگین بودن آنچه متعلق به آن است
این ، از آنچه که آن را معتبر و آن می داند
که این کار را نمی کند ، و از آن که به آن اعطا می کند
موفقیت و آن چیزی که آن را انکار می کند. در این
متوسط ​​بودن با آن چه چیزی را تجویز می کند
می تواند و ممکن است مورد توجه قرار گیرد ، مراقب آن است
همه چیز استثنایی که خود را به آن سوق می دهد
جلو هر نوع اولویت بی صدا می شود-
سرکوب شده یک شبه ، هر آنچه هست
ابتدایی به عنوان چیزی که می شود براق می شود
مدتهاست که شناخته شده است همه چیز به دست آورد
با یک مبارزه فقط به چیزی تبدیل می شود
دستکاری شده هر راز نیروی خود را از دست می دهد. این
مراقبت از متوسط ​​بودن به نوبه خود ضروری است
گرایش Dasein که ما آن را "تراز کردن" می نامیم
پایین "از همه امکانات موجود. (Bt 165)

خوب بیایید ، و این تقویت می کند که من خوب به نظر می رسم. و فقط می رود
اطراف و اطراف درز
بنابراین وقتی خوب به نظر نمی رسید ، خوب به نظر می رسد ، و وقتی این کار را می کنید
خوب به نظر برسید ، این باعث می شود خوب به نظر برسد. جودی
و این در زندگی من وجود داشته است که در آن ، به نظر می رسد خوب من را مانع می کند
از بیان آنچه می خواهم بیان کنم. من می توانم به خانه به ارتباط صمیمی خود بروم-
من و من می توانیم به تنهایی به خانه برویم و بگوییم "خوب ، حداقل من خوب به نظر می رسم."

بله گوش کن 625 دلار کوچک شما ، این مرغ در مقایسه با آنچه شما فقط است
از او گرفتم شما نمی توانید آن نوع صداقت را بخرید. این بینش بیشتر از بیشتر است
مردم همیشه در کل زندگی خود خواهند داشت. آنچه او به شما گفت این است که شما
زندگی خود را ندارید. به دنبال خوب زندگی شما است. و زندگی مربوط به خود نیست-
PRESSESSION اکنون می دانید که چرا هیچ رضایت در موفقیت شما وجود ندارد. نگاه
خوب خوشحال کننده است ، اما برآورده نمی شود. متوجه می شوید که هرگز کافی نیست. هیچ چیز نیست
به اندازه کافی هیچی هیچ چیز شما را کامل و کامل نمی کند ، هیچ چیز باقی نمی ماند
شما پر از شادی زیرا این نام بازی نیست. نام
بازی خوب به نظر می رسد. این تنها بازی در شهر است. شما زندگی نمی کنید. شما
خوب به نظر می رسند البته برخی از افراد با نگاه بد خوب به نظر می رسند. بسیاری از
مردم با قربانی بودن خوب به نظر می رسند. به عنوان مثال ، اگر جایی را پیچ کنید
وقتی بچه هستید و توجه زیادی می کنید. افرادی که قادر نیستند. این یک راه است
از زندگی برای برخی از افراد ، ارگان وجود دارد که با چیزهای الکتریکی سروکار دارند ،
و آنها آن اندام را ندارند ، می بینید. (خنده)
چندی پیش آنها زنان را به عنوان یک نفع در اسکاتلند به مرگ سوزاندند زیرا آنها
روح در اختیار داشت. بهترین افراد جامعه از آزمایشات استفاده کردند
ببینید آیا روح یک زن در اختیار یک شیطان بود. بسیاری از آنچه شما می دانید
درست باشد به همان ترتیب همان چیزی است که آن اسکاتلندی ها می دانستند که باعث سوزاندن آنها شد
زنان به مرگ. یکی از آن مواردی که درست نیست این است که شما زندگی خود را دارید ،
زیرا شما نمی کنید. یکی از آن مواردی که درست نیست این است که شما آزاد هستید ، اما
شما نیستید شما متعلق به نگاه خوب هستید. جودی
برای من آنچه اتفاق افتاد این بود که من به عنوان یک کودک جذاب نبودم. من 5 فوت 8 اینچ بودم
در 12 سالگی من همیشه در یک جمعیت ایستاده بودم ، گاو و همه اینها بود. همیشه
محبوب دختران و هرگز با پسران. در تمام راه غیر جذاب
دبیرستان. و هنگامی که من 17 ساله بودم ، دگرگونی اتفاق افتاد. من 35 پوند از دست دادم ،
لنزهای تماسی و یک مدل موی حرفه ای دارید. همه مردان ناگهانی من را دوست داشتند. چیزی که برای من نشان داد این بود که وقتی من جوان بودم ، من را دوست نداشتند. در مجموع ، این روشهای بودن - مقاومت ، میانگین و
سطح پایین - آنچه را که هایدگر "عمومی بودن" می نامد ، تنظیم کنید.
کدام
"
هر راهی را کنترل می کند که جهان و داعش
sein تفسیر می شود ، و همیشه درست است - نه
زیرا برخی متمایز و اولیه وجود دارد
رابطه ای که در آن مرتبط است
به "چیزها" ، یا به این دلیل که از برخی خود بهره می برد
شفافیت از طرف Dasein که آن است
صریحاً تخصیص داده است ، اما به این دلیل که هست
حساس به هر تفاوت سطح و از
اصالت و به این ترتیب هرگز به قلب نمی رسد
از موضوع. "(Bt 165 ، تأکید اضافه شده)
سرانجام ، اگرچه به نظر می رسد همه اینها یک غیرقابل اعتماد را نقاشی می کنند-
تصویر تاریک برای احتمال Dasein در جهان بودن ، در آنجا
یک عنصر دیگر است که در نگاه اول ممکن است به نظر برسد
برخی از تسکین ، و ممکن است (حداقل در ابتدا) "صعود از آن" نامیده شود
آنها خودشان. " در مدل ورنر ارهارد ، در واقع یکی از موارد است
"بازپرداخت S" در ساختار یک راکت:
"
[ب] به دلیل "آنها" هر داوری را ارائه می دهد
و تصمیم خود را به عنوان خاص خود ، از این امر محروم می کند
لار داسین از پاسخگویی آن. "آنها" می توانند ،
همانطور که بود ، می توانید دائماً "آنها" داشته باشید
دعوت از آن بشر بشر بشر این "همیشه" بود "آنها"
این کار را کرد ، اما با این وجود می توان گفت که بوده است
"هیچ کس." بشر بشر . این داسین خاص در آن است
روزمره توسط "آنها" از بین می رود. نه
فقط آن ؛ با این کار آن را از وجود آن جدا کرد ،
"آنها" در صورت داشتن داسین ، داسین را در خود جای می دهند
هرگونه تمایل به آسان کردن کارها و ساختن
آنها آسان است (bt 165)
و چه داسین نمی خواهد کارها را آسان کند؟ اجتناب

حالا این درست است؟ آیا این اتفاق افتاده است؟ "مردان من را دوست ندارند؟" آیا این درست است "من جذاب نیستم"؟ است ،
این درست است؟ آیا این می تواند درست باشد؟ چه کسی گفت بله؟ "جذاب نیست" ممکن است اتفاق بیفتد؟ بایستید من می خواهم
شما به من بگویید که چگونه می تواند این اتفاق بیفتد. سام
من می توانم آن را درست کنم که جذاب نیستم. درز
اوه ، این یک داستان است "جذاب نیست" نمی تواند اتفاق بیفتد. آیا تا به حال تعجب کرده اید ، "آن مرد خیلی جذاب نیست. چگونه او تا به حال آن زن را بدست آورد؟ او باید نابینا باشد." آیا می دانید که جذابیت عجیب ترین است
چیزهایی در جهان؟ همه جذاب هستند بسیاری از مردم طعمه خود را ترول نمی کنند ، این همه است. بنابراین اگر
داستان شما این است که "من قد بلند و مبهم و جذاب نیستم" ، شما طعمه خود را ندارید. من خواهم بود
با توجه به آنچه من دیده ام ، مایل به شرط بندی هستم که کسی وجود ندارد که هیچ کس در آن وجود نداشته باشد. شما شروع می کنید
برای زندگی از داستانی که جذاب نیستید. اگر در حال ترول نیستید ، به من نگویید که هیچ فری وجود ندارد. (به جودی)
می گفتی؟ جودی
بنابراین جذاب شدم. و می دانم که می توانم به یک اتاق راه بروم و هر مردی به من نگاه می کند. این برای من اتفاق افتاده است درز
هیچ چیز در مورد بلند بودن تغییر نکرده است ، درست است؟ قد بلند اکنون جذاب است. همان چیزها من می خواهم این را بدست آورم
با شما پاک کنید شما باید این را بدست آورید. Erhard به سمت تخته سیاه قدم زد و دو محافل را کشید. یک دایره ای که او را "جذاب" می نامید
دارای برچسب "جذاب نیست". او در هر دو "بلند" نوشت. (ادامه)
نحوه چیزها با روشی که امور تعیین نمی شود ، تعیین نمی شود. فکر کردن سخت است ، بنابراین این چیزی است که
من از شما می خواهم که فکر کنید. نحوه تعیین امور با زمینه ای که در آن اتفاقات رخ می دهد تعیین می شود. حرف
من می خواهم که شما شروع به دیدن این قسمت - دایره ، زمینه - بسیار مهم است. من می گویم که شرایط هرگز مشکلی ایجاد نمی کند. من اهمیتی نمی دهم که در شما اتفاق افتاده است
حرف
زندگی این مشکل نیست من اهمیتی نمی دهم که وقتی یک دختر کوچک یا تو بودی مورد تجاوز قرار گرفتی
وقتی پسر بچه ای بودید مورد آزار و اذیت قرار گرفتید. من اهمیتی نمی دهم که چه کسی در آنجا با سرطان نشسته است. من می دانم
شما فکر می کنید که این کار بدی برای شما انجام داد. من می گویم نه شرایط هرگز احتمال وجود ندارد
لیم قد بلند در یک زمینه جذاب نیست ، در یک حوزه از وجود ، و قد بلند اتفاق می افتد
جذاب در حوزه دیگری از وجود. کسی آن را دریافت نکرده است؟ این هرگز اتفاقی نیست که اتفاق افتاده است
مشکل من اهمیتی نمی دهم که در زندگی شما اتفاق افتاده است. این مشکل نیست. مشکل این است
زمینه ای که "چه اتفاقی افتاد" رخ داد. (به جودی)
بله ، شما می گفتید ... به کسی یا چیز دیگری که می توانید اشتباه کنید ، این است
بازپرداخت قابل توجه راکت شخص ، تمایزی که بوده است
چندین بار ذکر شده اما تا زمان مشخص نمی شود
جلسه بعدی گذشته از بازپرداخت ، ساختار یک راکت دیگری دارد
عنصر: هزینه. و در اینجا هایدگر آن را نامگذاری می کند: "[b]
"آنها" دائماً dasein خاص را توسط disbur-
"آنها" که آن را از وجود آن نفی می کند ، سرسختانه خود را حفظ و تقویت می کند
Dominion "(Bt 165). از طریق تسلیم خود به تسلط
حرف
"آنها" ، داسین امنیت دکارتی بودن را پذیرفته است
درست در میانگین آن ؛ اما در عین حال آن را قربانی کرده است
آزادی و قدرت. همانطور که جودی شرکت کننده در انجمن اظهار داشت ، "نگاه کنید-
با قوانین خوب زندگی من. "
هایدگر می گوید ، در این "شخصیت های وجود"
"ثبات" Dasein که به ما نزدیکترین است "(BT 166). مطمئناً ،
حرف
نگرش و رفتارهایی که وی در اینجا ارائه کرده است برای همه آشنا است
از ما - و اگر نتوانیم آنها را در خودمان بشناسیم ، می توانیم
مطمئناً آنها را در دیگران یا در فرهنگ به طور کلی تشخیص دهید. وت
ما باید در تأیید اینکه توصیف او- احساس ناراحتی می کنیم-
تهاجم بسیار مناسب است. اما صحبت مستقیم در مورد نحوه نگاه چیزها اکنون Essen-
اولین قدم برای به دست آوردن دیدگاه جدید ؛ و در انجمن ،
ایجاد یک امکان جدید باید با یک نگاه سخت انجام شود
روش فعلی ما هایدگر ما را از مراحل عبور می دهد
یک بار "
نه خود Dasein خود و نه
خود دیگری هنوز خود را پیدا کرده یا گمشده است
خودش تا زمانی که در حالت هایی باشد که داشته باشیم
ذکر شده در این حالت ها یک روش بودن
آیا عدم اعتماد به نفس و عدم ایستادن است

وقتی کودک بودم ، پسران را دوست نداشتم. این داستان من است ... erhard
یا پسران چیزهای خاصی را به شما نگفتند. این همان اتفاقی است که افتاد و پسران به طور مشخص عمل نکردند
راه با شما هزار داستان ممکن وجود دارد: "من آنقدر عالی بودم که آن دسته از Twerps این کار را نکردند
توپ ها را به من بگویید که آنها به آن دختران کوچک گفتند. "
جودی
این همان چیزی است که من اکنون می گویم. درز
تنها چیزی که من سعی می کنم به آن اشاره کنم این است که یک داستان فقط یک داستان است. "چه اتفاقی افتاد" ، این واقعیت است
یا نه این کار را کرد یا این کار را نکرد. بیشتر درست است از آنجا که او حتی متوجه نمی شد پسران نمی گویند
یا به روشی خاص عمل کنید ، مگر اینکه گوش دادن او "پسران من را دوست ندارند". اگر گوش دادن شما همین است
کسی شما را دوست ندارد ، هر آنچه که می گویند بیان دوست داشتن شما نیست. اگر هل دادیم
جودی به اندازه کافی او می توانست برگردد و به یاد بیاورد که "آره ، یکی از آنها سعی داشت باشد
یک بار با من خوب است. " چیزی شبیه به آن
بنابراین من جذاب شدم و مردان از من خواستند. آنچه اکنون من به عنوان یک نوجوان اعتقاد داشتم
آن مردها من را دوست نداشتند ، بنابراین وقتی جذاب شدم ، مثل پوسته ای بود که من روی آن قرار می گرفتم. درز
این خوب است من مجبور شدم شما را متوقف کنم زیرا آنها مانند این گوش می دهند یک اپرا صابون است و آنها به آنها احتیاج دارند
برای گوش دادن عمیق (به گروه)
اگر جذاب نیستید که جذابیت نداشته باشید ... اگر واقعاً کسی هستید غیر جذاب است ، اما
آنها نمی دانند ، هر بار که جذاب هستید ، آنچه در آن باقی مانده اید غیر جذاب است. هنگامی که شما جذابیت جذاب را تغییر می دهید ، آنچه همچنان ادامه دارد غیر جذاب است. این یک بازی con است ، under-
نیت که غیر جذاب است. هیچ شیء وجود ندارد که کیفیت "جذاب" داشته باشد. وجود وجود ندارد
در جذابیت بودن. من فکر می کنم چیزهای فوق العاده ای در خانه من وجود دارد ، سگ درست قدم می زند. جودی
وقتی کسی به من می گوید "شما واقعاً زیبا هستید" ، آنچه برای من مطرح می شود "اما شما این کار را نمی کنید
واقعاً من را بشناسید. " وقتی به خانه می روم ، این کار را می کنم و من واقعی هستم و شما آن را دوست ندارید
شخص درز
این چیزی است که شما می خواهید بدست آورید: هیچ کس نمی خواهد این را در مورد خودشان بداند. هیچ کس نمی خواهد
واقعاً در زیر آن همه چیز را واقعاً غیر جذاب قرار دهید. به همین دلیل 625 دلار پرداخت کردید. چون
در اینجا ، ساختار یافته است تا بتوانید به این نتیجه برسید - تا حدی که جودی می تواند با این کار باشد و او
"
تنها چیزی که سعی می کنم به آن اشاره کنم این است که یک داستان فقط است
یک داستان "چه اتفاقی افتاد" ، این همان چیزی است که
درست است یا نه این کار را کرد یا این کار را نکرد. بیشتر درست است
