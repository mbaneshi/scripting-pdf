Forum Day Four: Session One
327
Probably a lot of people here can identify with that. I’ve noticed a lot of tears. I’ve been identi-
fying and commiserating with a lot of people. What I tell myself is that I’m crying for me. I’m
very selfi sh. And what I thought I heard Werner say yesterday was “Get off  it.” And that really
scares me.
KIPP
What does that mean, it really scares you to get off  it?
KENNETH
Well I just lost my job. I’m about to lose my marriage. I think I just lost the house I was going
to buy.
KIPP
You mean you got fi red?
KENNETH
Yes.
KIPP
You don’t lose jobs. You lose keys, right?
KENNETH  (laughter)
Right. My story is I got laid off . I really got fi red.
KIPP
Got it.
KENNETH
It feels good to say that. I’ve got a long history of “poor me” and boy that’s fucking me.
KIPP
No, it’s poor me-ing you. Poor me is poor me; not poor me is not poor me. They both mean the
same thing: nothing.
KENNETH
Yes. I almost got to the point where I can laugh about that.
KIPP
Careful, don’t. It’ll be a shock to your system.
KENNETH
Right. And when I was looking at...

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
You are truly a heavy guy, aren’t you?
KENNETH
Yes. And I’ve lost a lot of vitality in the last...
There was laughter from the participants, because the absence of vitality was so apparent.
KIPP
You’re also a master of understatement.
KENNETH  (laughing)
And to have a certain façade that really I thought worked.
KIPP
And you have to keep that whole heavy and signifi cant thing in place!
KENNETH
Right. And then to fi nd out it doesn’t mean shit.
KIPP
Right.
KENNETH
Wooo!
KIPP
What it means is being heavy and signifi cant, and whatever else you say, that’s what it means.
KENNETH
Just before dinner last night I got light.
KIPP
Yeah, and it scared the shit out of you. You see it’s risky. See, what you already are is familiar.
Being scared, sad, upset. That’s what you call “you.” Anything else is unfamiliar. Unfamiliar is
awkward, embarrassing, so you’ll take anything that’s familiar, even if it’s destroying your life.
KENNETH
Yeah, at dinnertime I felt great, like maybe I could get off  this schtick. I had a real sense there
of lightness and then I got heavy.
