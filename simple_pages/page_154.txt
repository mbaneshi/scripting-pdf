SPEAKING BEING
MIKE
I don’t know.
KIPP
Look at your life. What is your life about? What is something that if you could do, you’d do it?
MIKE
I would have everybody like me.
KIPP
But...
MIKE
But if they get to know me, they stop listening to me after ninety seconds.
KIPP
When you are in the presence of another human being, what’s there?
MIKE
I look at the ceiling.
KIPP
Do you feel stupid?
MIKE
Yes.
KIPP
What happened when you were young?
MIKE
I tried to get in with a crowd of kids at school. I tried to blend in. A good friend of mine turned 
away and cut me out of the circle.
KIPP
Any others?
MIKE
When I was sweeping. Ten-years-old. My dad said I didn’t sweep well. I wasn’t smart enough to 
sweep.
