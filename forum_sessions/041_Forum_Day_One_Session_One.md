Forum Day One: Session One
27
BILL
I appreciated her concern about my welfare.
ERHARD
Did you really, or were you bullshitting her?
BILL
No.
ERHARD
So you never told her “no,” right?
BILL
Never directly “no.”
ERHARD (turning to the group)
I’m revealing the nature of pressure. That’s what Bill and I are having this conversation
about. Nobody does The Forum because they were pressured into it.
(Erhard placed his hands on Bill’s head and pushed down)
That’s what pressure is. But what had the people from the Center done? They called you. They
spoke to you. What else did they do? They stayed engaged in the conversation with you because
you never said no.
BILL
They called me every day.
ERHARD
Every day?
BILL
Well, maybe every other day.
ERHARD (to the group)
You all have a story, and your story is as full of shit as Bill’s. And I’m using language that’s
clear enough for everybody to understand.
(to Bill)
Bill, because you’ve been carrying this load for everyone, you can leave now whatever your
reason.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (pausing)
You’ve got a story called pressure. You’ve got a story and then there’s what happened.
BILL
I just want to say that I was disillusioned by the salesmanship involved in getting me into the
program...
ERHARD (interrupting)
What is this salesmanship?
BILL
Let me fi nish my sentence!
ERHARD
I’m not interested in your fi nishing your sentence when it’s bullshit.
BILL
Bullshit fl ows both ways.
(laughter)
ERHARD
What is this salesmanship you’re talking about? You wouldn’t have been called any more if
you’d said no. You said “Call me some more.”
(turning to the group)
If you think you were pressured, I want you to stop lying about it and tell the truth about what
happened or get out of here.
BILL
Why don’t you look at me? These people aren’t interested in being entertained by you on my
eccentricities.
ERHARD
Bill, I’m more likely to know what they’re interested in than you. Are you able to make a choice
about being here now that you’ve got a choice?
BILL (stammering)
Some of what you’ve done is off ensive to me. I might get something. I don’t know.
ERHARD
Would you make that choice for me?
