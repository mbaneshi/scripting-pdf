Forum Day Four: Session Three 479
ERHARD
Now, you think that the ball is uncatchable or isn’t uncatchable. I’m telling you that his
actions are not correlated to an “is uncatchable.” His actions are correlated with an “occurs as
uncatchable.” Occurs. You get the diff erence?
JERRY
I get the second, what was the fi rst...?
ERHARD (throwing the ball to a participant in another part of the room from Jerry)
Let me ask you something: Was that ball uncatchable for you?
JERRY
Yes.
ERHARD
No, because there’s a possibility of your catching the ball.
(throwing the ball the same way again)
Catch that ball. What happened?
JERRY
I didn’t catch it.
ERHARD
Because it occurred as uncatchable for you.
JERRY
Right.
ERHARD
Is that clear for you?
JERRY
Yes.
ERHARD
And if I’m a certain way, and the ball goes like  that,
(throwing the ball again)
the ball occurs as uncatchable for me. If I threw the ball and it occurred as uncatchable for you,
you wouldn’t have put your hand up like that, you would have acted “clumsy.” So your actions,
and her actions, and my actions, and his actions are all a correlate of the ball as an occurring,
not the ball as an is. That ball is going a certain rate of speed and it is within a certain number
of inches from your body.
Event Ontology
To begin, try this: imagine that the phenomena in the world
around you—people, trees, dogs, the sky—do not merely exist, but
are at every moment coming into existence. Imagine that when you
look at a tree, you aren’t observing a thing that is just there, but
an event. The tree is occurring. Instead of just a tree, like a thing,
you are in the presence of a happening: treeing. The happening is
ongoing, as the tree withdraws from the world and emerges—its
emergence and withdrawal so correlated in time that they are
perceived only as a quality of aliveness. You sense the withdrawal,

SPEAKING BEING
JERRY
I hear you. I’m worried that I’m missing what “is” means.
ERHARD.
Good. Listen up. You told me what you didn’t get. We would say, you and I, because of the way
you and I are, that the ball is going at a certain speed, and it is arriving at a certain proximity to
your body at a certain place. So we would say it is catchable depending on how fast it’s going
and on how far it was when it started coming at you...
JERRY
I have a problem concentrating on what you’re saying. I’m sorry. It’s like you’re talking too fast
or I’m thinking too slow.
ERHARD
I understand: We’re talking in a place where you have your foot nailed to the fl oor. It’s all right.
You’re doing great. Just tell me to slow down.
JERRY
Thank you. Please slow down.
ERHARD
We’re contrasting an “is” ball and an “occurring” ball.
JERRY
I understand an occurring ball, I don’t understand an “is” ball.
ERHARD
The ball is going at a certain speed, yes? And the ball is in your range of vision for a certain
amount of time.
JERRY
Okay.
ERHARD
That’s what is, you and I would say. It is going at a certain speed. And it is in your range of
vision for a certain amount of time. And you and I would say if it is going in this envelope of
speed—not faster than this, but in this envelope of speed—and if you have that much time to
watch the ball going at that speed, the ball is catchable.
JERRY
Right. I got it.
ERHARD
So that’s an is catchable ball. But you and I do not act on “is ball”; you and I act on “occur ball.” It
doesn’t make any diff erence how fast the ball is going. Your actions are correlated to how fast the ball
and the absence, as a persisting background that contextualizes
your experience of the presence. In the presence of something,
you sense the possibility of nothing.
Heidegger scholar Susan Schoenbaum has proposed an
interesting analogy as a clue to this world of emergence and
withdrawal: the way the diff erentiation between foreground and
background occurs for us in our visual consciousness:
In this diff erentiation, the background is deter-
mined as receding into indetermination as the
foreground becomes more or less determinate.
The phenomenal movement of foregrounding
and backgrounding, the coming to be back-
ground and the coming to be determinate fore-
ground, all occur simultaneously. This complex
movement of determination is originary in the
sense that it makes simultaneously possible
(a) the determination of background (however
indeterminate) as background and foreground
as foreground, (b) the consequent appearing
of determinate beings that appear (in the
foreground), and (c) the coming into being of
the entire constellation as context or world,
including background, foreground, and the
determinate movements of diff erentiation. All
these aspects belong to an originary event of
diff erentiation of background and foreground.

Metaphysics, 149–150, emphasis added)
“
In other words, there is much going on in our perception of the
world that happens below the level of awareness even as it shapes
that awareness.
Imagine now that this is the nature of reality: that we live
in a world of be-ings, rather than merely beings, a world that is
renewing itself in each instant. And imagine further that you, as a
being in that world, are likewise emerging newly in every moment.
Imagine that “you” are not a fixed phenomenon, but that, like
the tree, you occur, for yourself and for others, and withdraw, and
occur, a new being in each occurrence. Imagine that a human
