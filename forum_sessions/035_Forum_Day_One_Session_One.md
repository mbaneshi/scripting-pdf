Forum Day One: Session One
21
DORIS
Okay.
She sat. A man rose to object to Erhard’s earlier assertion that our ways of being, such as nervous-
ness, own us.
FOSTER
I understand that being nervous is a human quality. Why don’t I own being nervous? Isn’t that
a quality of me?
ERHARD
Where is this quality?
FOSTER (pointing to his heart)
Here, and it’s pounding!
ERHARD
My dog’s heart pounds. You and I explain things about people by assigning qualities to them.
But this may not be eff ective if what you want to do is have access to the things you’re explain-
ing. The language we use every day is designed to explain things. The language we use in here
is designed to gain access to things. So it’s a diff erent language. Explanations give no access to
power. If you want power and access, we’re going to invent such a language in here. I’m not
limited to merely reporting the way I am. I’m an anti-quality-ist. You ain’t got any qualities
inside you. Qualities are an explanatory principle. It won’t hold up on closer examination.
Erhard was now in the aisle, moving among the participants. One rose to defend the importance of
having what he called self-beliefs.
RAY
How does one hold beliefs about oneself and about reality in a way to be powerful and creative?
ERHARD
One of the ways is to not have any beliefs. Does anyone need to believe that the fl oor is there?
You don’t need to have any belief about the fl oor and it works just fi ne. And if you didn’t have
any beliefs about gravity it would work just fi ne. You only need to believe in things that you
doubt. The only problem with belief is that you can’t think about anything you believe.

RAY
I have an interpretation about myself, and how do I hold that interpretation?
ERHARD
As an interpretation.
Being-in articulates an essentially different relationship
from the one we usually have in mind when we say something is
“in” something. If we say “the water is in the glass,” for example,
the two phenomena being related have a prior and individual
existence in space: the water was there, and the glass was there.
We have simply put one in the other. Further, as Heidegger points
out, we can easily extend such relationships outward: the glass is
on the table, the table is in the kitchen, the kitchen is in the house,
and so on, until finally we can say that the water is in “world
space” (BT 79).
T
Objects such as the glass and the table are, in Heidegger’s
vocabulary, “things occurring ‘within’ the world” (BT 79).
T
Therefore they have a different kind of being from Dasein. The
table and the glass are whats; their characteristics are categorical.
While the table and the glass can have a location-relationship
within the world, the water is not in the glass in the same way that
a human being is in-the-world.
Dasein, on the other hand, is a who, and its characteristics
are existential, which define an existence structure quite different
from that of a table. This is, of course, on one level obvious.
But Heidegger, remember, is languaging a view of the world
that is very different from our everyday way of understanding
things. Therefore he is rigorous in setting out the terminological
differences between states of being.
A chair can be next to the wall, but the chair can never touch
the wall, “even if the space between them should be equal to
zero” (BT 81). Heidegger is not making a sensory distinction but
T
an ontological one. To touch is to encounter meaningfully, and
such meaningful encounters are possible only for entities with
meaning. In Heidegger’s vocabulary, a table and a chair are
worldless.
Werner Erhard can be seen as distinguishing worldlessness
early in The Forum, in his interactions with participants on the
subject of whether the rain falls in order to water the flowers. In
doing so, he is beginning to create an understanding of meaning
as a human characteristic, rather than an aspect of the things out
there in the world. This distinction will be further developed later

SPEAKING BEING
RAY
Thank you.
Shortly before the fi rst break of the morning, Erhard introduced a new topic:
ERHARD
The next subject is the matter of your being here. At the upcoming break, you will be given an
opportunity to leave and have your money refunded. You want to listen up! I’m going to give
you the opportunity not to be here. You shouldn’t be here if you didn’t put yourself here. The
Forum won’t work for you anyhow, so you’re wasting your time here. You shouldn’t be here if
you’re here because you were threatened. We don’t allow people to participate in The Forum
who were coerced or threatened. You may have been here on that basis up till now. You can
leave now and you’ll get all your money back. And if you’ll get in trouble with whoever you’re
here for, I’ll write a note that says that you begged and pleaded and tried to stay here and I
threw you out. If you’re here because you were pressured into being here, would you stand up
please?
(one participant stood)
Anybody else?
(another long pause as another stood)
I’m going to say “Anybody else?” fi ve more times.
Eventually several people stood in response to his request, and he began to interact with them
individually. The interactions varied strikingly in their tone. With the fi rst participant, a teenager
named Kathy, Erhard’s manner was quite gentle. He moved closer to her, standing at a distance of
about four feet. Before beginning the conversation, he asked her if she was willing to interact with
him in front of the group, acknowledging that it might be “scary” for her to do so. He then reiterat-
ed his assertion that pressure, like embarrassment and hustle, was a clearing she was bringing to
the circumstances:
ERHARD (continuing)
I know that if you’re here because somebody pressured you to be here, that that’s an issue in
your life. The only people who experience being pressured about The Forum are those for
whom pressure is an issue. I’m giving you the opportunity to make a choice. Now that I’ve
given you the choice, would you like to leave or would you like to be here? There will be no bad
results from you leaving. You’ll get your money back.
KATHY
That’s good. I feel like I have the opportunity to choose now, whereas, before, I didn’t feel like
that.
on the first day when participants’ stories about the events in
their lives are distinguished from the events themselves.
Human beings exist in a world of meaning, and their
relationship with that world is fundamental. In-ness is an aspect
of Dasein’s existence from the ground up. Consider: a human
being never exists as a (meaningful) human being until she exists
in-the-world, and when she leaves the world (dies), she ceases to
exist (as a human being). Heidegger’s German term for the Being-
in relationship (Sein bei) carries the implication of what we would
call being at home (BT 80, note 3). Dasein is at home in the world,
T
Being-with others. “Being-with” is examined in the first sidebar of
Session One of Day Two, and we address the “world” of Being-in-
the-world at the beginning of Session One of Day Four. ■
