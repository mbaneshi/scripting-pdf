Forum Day Three: Session Three 235
JACOB
I was just thinking if you take the phrase “nothing means anything” in a positive way. The 
words are interchangeable. The word nothing means anything; anything is nothing. That 
might be the kind of hippy defi nition you don’t like.
ERHARD
True.
JACOB
I know, I know. I don’t like it either, but...
ERHARD
I’ll tell you what I do like, though, is I like that you’re engaged in the conversation. What I 
don’t like is being facile about it. Do you know what I mean by the word facile? Live easy with 
it.
JACOB
Yeah.
ERHARD
You’ve got to be ballsy with it. You’ve got to get down with this. This is not some airy fairy crap. 
I didn’t say you’ve got to talk bad like I do. You’ve got to get down in your own way, but you’ve 
got to get down. You’ve got to get out of that “whoooo” shit.
KIPP
And you’ve made it into that. Do you know that?
JACOB 
Yeah. What I wanted to say a couple of days ago about doing what you can or can’t do, I think 
it was Benjamin Franklin who said...
(forgetting)
ERHARD
I know what they said too, but I can never seem to remember it. We’ll read you that Einstein 
quote we butchered later.
(laughter)
JACOB
I remember now. He had a good defi nition of the word character. To have character is to follow 
through with the decision after the emotion of making that decision has passed. I thought 
that’s what Werner was saying about being facile.
