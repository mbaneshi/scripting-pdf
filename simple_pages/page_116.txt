SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
Don’t try to digest everything. What I want you to do is stand in it and look out in life.
MIKE
How do I do that?
ERHARD
Tell me how to walk. And then I’ll tell you how to do that.
MIKE
Lean forward.
ERHARD
Tell me how to lean forward.
MIKE
Bend your back.
ERHARD
Tell me how to bend my back.
(silence)
The truth is, you don’t know how to walk. You walk, but you don’t know how to walk. You 
don’t walk out of “knowing how.” Even if you studied anatomy and knew every single muscle I 
needed to use, and understood the operation of all the parts of the body, and all the neural path-
ways impulses had to be sent down, you wouldn’t know how to generate them in the fi rst place,
besides which, you couldn’t keep all that in mind to lift one leg up, let alone to walk, right? The
fact is you don’t know how to walk. You just walk.
MIKE
I guess I never looked at it from that point of view.
ERHARD
You never looked at it from that point of view. You don’t need to guess about it. Who you are is 
an “I guess.” You don’t know how to walk, do you?
MIKE
I can walk.
ERHARD
Yes. That’s not in discussion.
