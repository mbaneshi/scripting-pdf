Forum Day Four: Session Two

(laughter)r
Because you can’t choose mouth open with food in it. “Not that! No, not that!” You’ve got no
mastery yet. You’ve got no muscles for living your life yet. You’ve got a lot of muscles for per-
sisting and a lot of muscles for surviving, but no muscles for living, and the rest of the Forum
is committed to bringing forth a body of distinctions to give you those muscles. To begin to: It’s
not over in just four days. You’re not going to get a PhD in four days. It’s a beginning. A break-
through. An opening. I’m inviting you during the meal break to inquire into this distinction
choice. To notice what you’re willing to choose and mostly what you are not willing to choose.
Not like you’re bad, not like you’re wrong: just like you’ve cut out most of life for yourself. So far
your life has had to be consistent with your racket and that’s all that’s been available to you. I’m
inviting you to open that up for yourself.
Kipp announced that an opportunity to register into the seminar would occur after the meal break.
The Forum supervisor announced a dinner break at 4:35 pm, and that The Forum would begin again
at 6:35 pm.

SPEAKING BEING
The Forgetting of Being, Part Eight of Eight: The Heart of
the Matter
A significant moment in the development of Western thinking, for Martin Heidegger,
was that point in ancient Greek history that he calls the “the inceptive end of the
great inception” (IM 200). The great inception was the new possibility for Being-
in-the-world that emerged in the thinking of the pre-Socratics; and this possibility
reached its end with Plato. The end of a great possibility, however, does not occur as
the culmination of a decline:
The great begins great, sustains itself only through the free
recurrence of greatness, and if it is great, also comes to an
end in greatness. So it is with the philosophy of the Greeks.
It came to an end in greatness with Aristotle. (IM 17)
This process, which Heidegger calls “the play of Being,” has proceeded in such a way
that “this ‘inception’ also covered up the inceptive inception” (IM 200). This is why
current students of Western philosophy begin their studies with Plato and Aristotle:
the great inception of the pre-Socratics has been subsumed by the metaphysical
tradition of Western thinking, which has demonstrated its own greatness, and has
created the circumstances of its own end.
Plato’s role in this development lay in his reinterpretation of physis—which for
the pre-Socratics was the self-blossoming emergence of beings into the world—as
eidos, or idea. Here Heidegger suggests the implications of this move:
We can easily assess the distance between the two intepre-
tations if we pay attention to the diff erence between the
perspectives in which these essential determinations of
Being, physis and idea, move. Physis is the emerging sway,
the standing-there-in-itself, constancy. Idea, the look as
what is seen, is a determination of the constant insofar as,
and only insofar as, it stands opposed to a seeing. (IM 203,
emphasis added)
For Platonic thinking, then, the term idea had quite specific implications: “The word idea
means what is seen in the visible, the view that something offers. What is offered is the
current look or eidos of whatever we encounter” (IM 201).  Emergence has been captured
in appearance.

SESSION TWO INTERVAL
As this development has played itself out, therefore, the visible and substantial
outcome of unconcealment (i.e., the being that is unconcealed) has come to sub-
sume in understanding the process by and through which that being has emerged.
Idea, the “whatness” of beings, becomes the definitive interpretation of Being. Even-
tually, when Greek terms were translated into Latin by the Romans, physis became
natura. Nature, the manifestation of physis which is most visible and accessible to
us, in time came to represent Being.
Being was thereby enshrined in language as beings. But an element has gone
missing in that enshrinement, says Heidegger, since “to be the Being of beings is the
matter of Being” (EGT 50). Thus a puzzle arose, a puzzle in the languaging of Be-ing;
and the puzzle lay in the unobtrusive but critical word “of”:
The grammatical form of this enigmatic, ambiguous gen-
itive [“of”] indicates a genesis, the emergence of what is
present from presencing. Yet the essence of this emergence
remains concealed along with the essence of these two
words [“Being” and “beings”]. Not only that, but the very
relation between presencing and what is present remains
unthought. (EGT 50)
The thinking of both Heidegger and Werner Erhard is designed to distinguish this
relation between Being and beings, and to retrieve this relation from oblivion.
Subsequent to the oblivion of this relation, the question of Being, now under-
stood as a higher being, had to look beyond other beings in an attempt to find its
subject. For the Greeks, the tradition which placed Being beyond nature became
meta ta physika. Furthermore, this metaphysical separation of essence from exis-
tence was set firmly in place for the Western tradition by the thinking of Plato:
...Being as idea was elevated to a suprasensory realm.
The chasm, khorismos, was torn open between the merely
apparent beings here below and the real Being somewhere
up there. Christian doctrine then established itself in this
chasm, while at the same time reinterpreting the Below
as the created and the Above as the creator [. . .]. And so
Nietzsche is right to say that Christianity is Platonism for
the people. (IM 116)
We are approaching the heart of the matter with regard to the question which has
generated this inquiry: Why does the transformational experience that is made available
in The Forum occur as elusive, evasive, as a get-it-and-lose-it phenomenon?
