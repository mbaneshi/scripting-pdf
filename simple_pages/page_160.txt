SPEAKING BEING
ANGEL
Yes.
ERHARD
And what is the payoff  for being a victim? Take your time and look up there and say what the
payoff  is. 
(pausing as Angel stares at the chalkboard
(
)
Puzzling, isn’t it?
ANGEL
I don’t know what I get to be right about. I get to be right about what?
ERHARD
About being sincere.
ANGEL
And deeply emotional and caring. You forgot about that.
ERHARD
Yeah, you’re not deeply emotional and caring or sincere. You’re a fucking racketeer. And the 
racket is being a victim and the payoff  is that it makes you right. You’ve got this bullshit golden
calf called being deeply emotional and caring and being sincere. Being emotional and caring 
and sincere is bullshit. This is not holy or sacred. I didn’t say it wasn’t nice. So, you’ve got this
racket called being a victim and it makes you right because if you weren’t a victim and you 
weren’t suff ering, then you would be wrong, you would be invalidated, would you not?
ANGEL
Yes. 
ERHARD
You would be invalidated as a caring, deeply emotional, sincere person.
ANGEL
That’s why your telling me that I don’t hurt over my divorce invalidates and hurts.
ERHARD
I understand. I understand. All I’m doing is getting you, what I call “up on the pike,” so we can
work together on something. Did you want to say something?
ANGEL
I say that what I want to get out of The Forum is a marriage that would, like, last forever, but 
obviously what I’ve been about is making sure that I never can have that.
