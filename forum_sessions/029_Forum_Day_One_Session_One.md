Forum Day One: Session One

SAL
I believe that when it rains it rains in order to sustain life.
ERHARD
Okay, let’s stay there. Anybody else in that ballpark with Sal? Stand up if you are. Stand up if it
rains in-order-to.
(a number of people rose)
If you’re not standing and you are an in-order-to, you’re interfering with your participation in
The Forum. These people who are standing are not silly. They’ve got their foot nailed to the
fl oor someplace. This will happen to all of you a lot of times during The Forum.
(to Sal, indicating the director’s chair on the platform)
Are the legs there to hold up the chair? We know that the legs do hold up the chair. For the legs,
is there any in-order-to? Are the legs in-ordering-to?
(pausing)
It’s too hard that way... let me try something diff erent. Is the wall standing in order to hold the
ceiling up?
SAL
Yes, in my opinion.
ERHARD
Does the lightning lightning in order to start forest fi res?
SAL
No.
ERHARD
Where is this organ of intentionality in the rainstorm?
SAL
The spirituality of the universe.
ERHARD  (to the group)
He just told me where his foot’s nailed to the fl oor. He’s got something he believes so he can’t
think about it.
(to Sal)
You think there’s an intentionality in the rainstorm. You said it’s your belief that matter was
invaded by spirit in some way. Does it rain in order to produce fl oods?
usual way of conceptualizing. Think “freedom” and a conceptual
barrage is evoked; think “Being” and the mind’s resources are few.
Our second thesis, since it eludes capture in concepts,
can only be hinted at. It exists always as a background,
in a domain of language that remains always unspoken.
Unspoken, it is the unexamined context that shapes the way we
understand everything else; unspoken, it is made present as
the transformational background in the dialogue of The Forum;
unspoken, it is hinted at persistently in Heidegger’s writing and in
his lectures. Our second thesis, then, is this unspoken domain of
language, formally referred to as the ontological realm.
In this book, to show what Werner Erhard and Martin
Heidegger are doing in their work, the authors are called upon
to say—to hint at—the unspoken shared dynamic at the center
of that work. Inevitably, an element of mystery attends this
topic; but nothing here is devious or arcane. While ontological
communication makes rigorous demands on our everyday
understanding, Erhard’s work is a practical pedagogical
methodology, demonstrating that education beyond the merely
epistemological is a real-world possibility.
The authors intend that our second thesis will be
communicated in the background as we proceed through this
book, leaving the reader with a hint of its nature as it emerges in
The Forum.
One aspect of this background communication is that
unfamiliar terms or concepts may not be fully defined at the
point of their first appearance. Rather, they will be distinguished
gradually as they appear and reappear in the text. A definition
specifies conceptual limits; a distinction opens a space for
thinking and acting, and the space is expanded each time the
distinction is encountered. The goal of the inquiry, then, is
never an answer, but the opening of a question from which
to experience the world. We invite the reader to embrace the
freedom that this background of questionability gives: at play in
the question, you don’t need the right answer.  ■

SPEAKING BEING
SAL
No.
ERHARD
So the intentionality organ is not operating when it produces fl oods?
SAL
No, that just happens.
ERHARD
But it doesn’t just happen that when it rains life is sustained? Remember, Sal, there’s no ques-
tion between you and me that water does sustain life. The  question is: does it rain in-order-to?
Or does it just happen, and by the way, it sustains life?
At this point Sal seemed to see Erhard’s point, and sat down.
ERHARD (to Sal)
Okay. Now, just something personal between you and me. I’ve done this a lot. There’s some-
thing I appreciated about you in this conversation. You were open in the conversation.
(to the group)
Nobody’s ever going to win with me in here. Because this is my game, and only an asshole
would try to win in another guy’s game. You and I had a discussion where we got something
t
together. Rain is impersonal. We weren’t talking about a higher order of things. I don’t want
anybody to believe anything I say. And I’m not interested in sustaining anything you believe.
BLAKE (recalling what had happened up to this moment in the conversation)
I know that there was some sequence and I missed it. I mentioned that I was nervous, that I
didn’t like it, and then we were talking about the rain.
ERHARD (to the group)
He just demonstrated not knowing, being clear he didn’t know. That’s diff erent from being con-
fused. This is one of those things to get. There’s a diff erence between knowing that you don’t
understand, knowing that you didn’t follow something; knowing something didn’t make sense
and being confused are very diff erent. You didn’t invent being nervous. Even though the rain is
impersonal, you do personally get wet. The same thing goes for being nervous. Being nervous
is part of being human. Being human doesn’t belong to you; you belong to it. You didn’t invent
being human. You were late for the party. Being human is an already always way of being that
you walked into. It’s like a rainstorm, and it’s true you personally got wet. You are a human
Ontologic al Dialogue
A striking aspect of Erhard’s method, one which appears again
and again throughout The Forum, is his persistence in pressing
any interaction or any topic of discussion through to completion.
Complete, for Erhard, does not mean simply finished, but rather
whole, and lacking none of its essential parts. Repeatedly, after
he has been engaged on a particular point with an individual, he
requests that others in the room who are not clear on that point
stand, and works with each participant individually until all of
them have “gotten” it for themselves. Erhard often uses the term
“flatten” in the same sense, as in “Let’s get that one flat before
we move on.” To get something flat, in an ontological dialogue,
means that the item in question has been moved beyond a purely
conceptual level of understanding, and has been distinguished
as an ontological possibility, at least in a preliminary sense. The
distinction will continue to be teased out as The Forum proceeds,
ultimately becoming a clearing for Being; but the first step in that
process is to flatten the concept, so that its ontological possibility
can be heard.
Of course, “getting it” and “being complete” might be
read as “having surrendered to Erhard’s point of view.” Erhard
himself seemed to support this interpretation, telling one Forum
participant Blake, “Nobody’s ever going to win with me in here.
Because this is my game, and only an asshole would try to win in
another guy’s game.” During a debriefing session with The Forum
leaders regarding their role in the dialogue, Erhard again referred
to the process in agonistic terms: “You’ve got to have some
appreciation for the advantage you’ve got there,” he said. “And
yeah, you’re going to use the advantage, that’s part of the game.”
