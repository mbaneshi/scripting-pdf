Forum Day Three: Session Three 213
ERHARD
Wait. Wait. See you just ruined it.
TONY
I’m just kidding.
ERHARD
You’re like a block and a half ahead of everybody. We’ve got to get everybody caught up to 
you. That’s why we got to discuss this now. There when you were a block and a half ahead of 
everybody, you made it mean something. “Then why am I here?” Well, where else would you 
be if you weren’t here? You’d be some other stupid place. You’re here because you’re here. You 
want to start getting what he’s saying. It’s not really a soap opera. It’s really a joke. You know 
what a joke is? A joke is when you think the soap opera’s real. That’s a joke. The joke is when 
you think you’re going to get someplace. That’s a joke. That’s a joke.
TONY
That’s a fi x.
ERHARD
Exactly. And that thing about “that’s why the world doesn’t work”; no, the world works fi ne. 
It works just like this. And the idea that you’re going to make the world work, whatever that 
means to you, is another joke. Look around you. That’s the way it is. Just like this.
TONY 
But we’ve gotten what the rest of the world hasn’t gotten.
ERHARD
So what? The fucking walls are still the walls. The ceiling is still the ceiling. Life is still the way 
it is. 
TONY
But by being diff erent...
ERHARD
What do you mean by diff erent?
TONY
By going through what we’ve just been through.
ERHARD
You’re no diff erent.
TONY
Okay.
