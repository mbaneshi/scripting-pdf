## 📄 Content

Introduction to Metaphysics, these lectures became his first book-length work to be
translated into English. He later extended his thinking on the subject in four essays,
published in 1975 as Early Greek Thinking. In these volumes, Heidegger locates the
source of Being’s withdrawal at the point of its first emergence. He calls this junc-
ture the beginning of history—the moment when the West’s first philosophers were
beginning to think about the nature of Being, and to understand themselves as
world-creators.
But in Heidegger’s account, Western thinking, at its very inception, failed to
capture the truth of Being in language. As a consequence, Being, and what its
experience might make available, has been lost to us, and so thoroughly that even
its conceptualization defies our thinking. What does Heidegger see as possible
if human access to Being was restored? He says that we would be opened to the
epiphany of a world (IM 69)—our everyday perceptions and experiences would occur
newly, in a context of possibility that is not present in our current view of things.
This context of possibility, he says, was available to humans in one brief
moment of history. What became of Being? In this series on the forgetting of Being,
during Intervals between sessions, we will present Heidegger’s account.

SPEAKING BEING
The Forum resumed at 4:20 pm. Kipp returned to the platform and called for participants to share
what they had discovered about their rackets.
KIPP
We asked you to distinguish sharing yourself. The time in The Forum for explaining your life is
f
over.
JODIE
I want a relationship.
KIPP
Are you sharing or talking about?
JODIE
I don’t know.
KIPP
My racket is... My payoff  is... The way my racket shows up in my life is... Share the juice.
JODIE
My racket is that I want a relationship. And every time one appears I sabotage it, so that it
doesn’t happen.
KIPP
What’s the truth?
JODIE
I’m not in a relationship.
KIPP
No. What’s authentic is “if I had a relationship, I’d be wrong. What gets me up in the morning is
how I can avoid being in a relationship.” And the racket is that you say what?
JODIE
That I want a relationship.
KIPP
Who do you get sucked into the racket? There’s a distinction called “on the court.” There’s
another distinction called “up in the stands talking about what’s on the court.” What your life is
about is not having a relationship. How do you feel about that?
