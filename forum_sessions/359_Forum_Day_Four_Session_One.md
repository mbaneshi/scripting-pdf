Forum Day Four: Session One

JACOB
Is that where possibility comes from, being empty?
ERHARD
It may or may not, but, in my answering you in the context in which you are asking me, that
isn’t going to make any diff erence for you, because you’re asking me in order to understand.
If you do this exercise... the way we know you did the exercise is because possibility arises.
Now I didn’t ask that question yet, we’re going to ask that question in a little while because we
need to get this other thing fl at fi rst. What we want to get fl at is not did you fi gure this out, and
does it fi t with everything you know. But rather, did you get that life is empty and meaningless
and it’s empty and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless? It has no inherent meaning,
no inherent signifi cance. Life is like a rainstorm. It does not rain in order to water the little
fl owers. It just fucking rains and life is like that. Life is just like it is. Life is just that way. It’s
not that way for a reason. It’s just that way. It’s just the way it is, and it’s just devoid of meaning
and signifi cance, except to the degree that you bring some meaning and signifi cance to it. And
the meaning and signifi cance that people bring to it does what you saw in here over the last
three days. So that’s what there is to get. What there is to get is that life is empty and meaning-
less and it’s empty and meaningless that it’s empty and meaningless. That is to say, it’s not only
empty and meaningless but you can’t make something out of that without getting into trouble.
Is that clear?
JACOB
Yeah. But...
ERHARD
You’re going to screw it up trying to make up a conclusion out of it.
JACOB
Yeah I am.
ERHARD
Don’t do that. Stop that.
JACOB
Okay.
(applause)
ERHARD
It’s very important what Jacob just illustrated for you. I heard you say it goes in and out and in
and out and in and out. It goes in and out and in and out because you try to make a conclusion.
I told you the truth has no use. It’s use-less. Worth-less. What is “worth”? Worth is what makes
Life is like a rainstorm. It does not rain in order
to water the little flowers. It just fucking rains
and life is like that. Life is just like it is. Life is
just that way. It’s not that way for a reason.
It’s just that way. It’s just the way it is, and it’s
just devoid of meaning and significance, except
to the degree that you bring some meaning
and significance to it. And the meaning and
significance that people bring to it does what
you saw in here over the last three days.

SPEAKING BEING
you right. That’s the only thing that’s worth anything. Something that makes you right; that’s
worth something. Something that makes somebody or something else wrong; that’s worth
something. Something with which you can dominate; that’s worth something. Something with
which you can avoid domination; that’s worth something. Something you can justify yourself
with or invalidate others; that’s worth something.
(loudly)
The truth isn’t worth anything. It’s worthless because you can’t use it. And the instant you try to
draw a conclusion from it, you make a “therefore”; you put a “therefore” behind the truth and
it sucks all the truth out of it. It’s no longer true; it is now more bullshit. You stumble across the
truth, you happen to bump into it, leave it alone. By leave it alone I don’t mean walk away from
it, or ignore it, I mean: let it be. Is that clear? You want to take that page out of Jacob’s book,
and it will move things forward here more rapidly. And we won’t still be here Monday morn-
ing.
(Jacob sits as Erhard addresses another standing participant)
You did not get that it’s empty and meaningless?
DENNIS
I want to believe that I’m getting it, but I’m not getting it.
ERHARD
What is it that you’re not getting?
DENNIS
That life is empty and meaningless.
ERHARD
Okay. What is the meaning of life?
DENNIS
I don’t know. That’s what I’m here for.
WES
I’m now going to tell you. You want to know the meaning of life? Let me tell you the meaning
of life, and then you’ll know the meaning of life and you’ll see the diff erence it makes in your
life.
Wes got a dictionary from the table and read from it the defi nition of “life”: “The property or quality
that distinguishes living organisms from dead organisms...etc.”
