Forum Day Two: Session Two

ERHARD
Watch out or we’re going to get too far ahead into The Forum.

In mapping this conversation onto an area of my life where I have a rich body of distinctions,
things like skiing or leading The Forum, or being with my kids. Looking at my kids’ develop-
ment. It seems like there are three things in the conversation for distinguishing distinction. I
wanted to see if I’m tracking with it. One is that it’s almost entirely in what is unsaid. What’s 
said is almost only because something needs to be said for there to be an unsaid.  The second is
that action is a necessary component.
ERHARD
Yeah, that would be misunderstood at this point. You can have an action in language too.

The spoken conversation doesn’t necessarily need to be about what’s being distinguished.
ERHARD
That’s right. That’s what I read from Heidegger about leaving it the realm of the unsaid. Like in 
the Karate Kid.

I had participation as a defi nition, and it shifted over to a distinction. I started to listen diff erent-
ly. When you talked about being used by a distinction, two things happened. I recalled a movie I
saw called The Gods Must Be Crazy. There was no Coke bottle for them, but I get that there was
no not-Coke bottle for me. I’m here for a breakthrough in my commitment in my relationship 
with my children and my wife. I’ve used up the context for my family.
 ERHARD
Listen up here. You create a possibility for your family and when you use up that possibility,
and wonder where the juice went: What’s missing may not be more and better content. What’s 
missing may be a new opening, a new possibility.

And I could see that the conversation for extending the single dimension. There’s a new demand
for myself for generating distinction.
ERHARD
Something extraordinary opens up with a new realm of distinction. It’s not additive. It’s unrelat-
ed to what it was before. No persistence of the old.

So now this isn’t news—the power of distinction—see I had that as a defi nition distinct from
HEIDEGGER’S PEDAGOGY
Here, despite the aff inities we are proposing between the thinking 
of Heidegger and the work of Werner Erhard, we call attention to a 
fundamental diff erence in the nature of their work. This diff erence 
lies in the rhetorical form of their communication. In The Forum, the
model is not orator and audience, a commonplace view of rhetoric. 
Rather, The Forum’s form, elements of which have emerged in the 
various perspectives expressed in this book, is rhetorical dialogue, a 
strategic transaction which has as its aim the inclusion of the dialogic 
participants in the disclosive experience itself. Preservation, in this 
model, stands in a diff erent relationship to disclosure: it becomes the 
dwelling-within the work by those who have themselves participated 
in the disclosive and creative act of communication.
