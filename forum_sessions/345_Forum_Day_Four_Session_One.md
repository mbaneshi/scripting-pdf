Forum Day Four: Session One

You understand that enthusiasm is a threat to your survival? Joy is a threat to your survival?
Self-expression is a threat to your survival? I’m not saying any of those are good, or the way
you should be, and the way you are isn’t the way you should be. I’m not saying that; it’s easy to
hear that. I’m just saying that you’re locked out of most of life. One’s not better than the other.
But right now you have no choice.
KENNETH
It would be nice to have a choice.
KIPP
It would give you freedom to have a choice.
KENNETH
Yeah, which is what I felt for a little bit last night.
KIPP
Yeah, and rigorously speaking, it wasn’t a feeling.
KENNETH
That’s what I saw last night.
KIPP
Yeah. Your feelings are a product of your racket, or the context of whatever you give your feelings to
occur in. So far your feelings have had the space of your racket.
KENNETH
Yes.
KIPP
Anything else?
KENNETH
Thank you.
(applause as Kenneth sat)
KIPP
Well done!
SARAH
Where do I start? Let me fi nd a place... I got my racket, and saw, last night, the terror of it.

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
Of what?
SARAH
My racket is “I’m an incompetent parent.” And as the people I had dinner with me last night
would tell you, you get anywhere close to that and like, it’s survival, this is war. It’s like, you
know...
KIPP
What are you talking about? What’s war? What’s survival?
SARAH
It’s like I... my racket is “I’m an incompetent parent.”
KIPP
You’re an incompetent parent.
SARAH
Right.
KIPP
And if somebody says...
SARAH
And if somebody even gets even pretty close to that...
KIPP
And questions you as a parent?
SARAH
They don’t even have to get that close. You know...
KIPP
Okay.
SARAH
So, last night, um, I was looking at some other always...already always beings, and I saw them
as, you know, there was no meaning there for them. I looked at my past. I’m from the South,
and I looked at some of these southern things we have; and I really got it: You can jump into
that game, or you don’t, you know, it’s there. And I looked at my “I’m an incompetent par-
ent” and the terror, and I really felt the terror, and I couldn’t get to no meaning, to empty and
meaningless. I couldn’t get it; I had that terror all night long. And I understood the person who
stood up and said “when I was a little kid I was embarrassed, and I’m never embarrassed.” He’s
The Call of Conscience
As we have shown, for both Martin Heidegger and Werner Erhard,
the current experience of human being is fundamentally missing
something. Heidegger located the source of this absence in the
assumptions of the metaphysical tradition, whose understanding
of the world does not include the background realm that he calls
Being. At this point in development of that tradition, that anything
is missing has also been forgotten; and beyond the next forgotten-
ness is oblivion (see the last sidebar of Session Three of Day
Four). “Being,” says Heidegger, “is still waiting for the time when
it will become thought-provoking to man” (“LH” in BW 227). Thus

a central task of The Forum is to make present this deficiency in
such a way that it transforms into a new possibility for Being.
However, human beings, when listening away to the “they”
self, avoid confronting any deficiency by embracing distraction,
losing themselves in the ways of the world into which they have
been thrown. The Self of Dasein, remember, is a way of existing,
and the way we exist is to fall into the arms of the possibilities we
find open to us—the arms of the “they,” a world of curiosity, idle
chatter, and ambiguity, which constitute the groundless public
discourse that is always right, and for whom nothing is new. But
in thus falling, we remain lost, wherein “Dasein makes no choices,
gets carried along by the nobody [the “they” self, or as Erhard
sometimes calls it, the “anybody” self] and thus ensnares itself in
