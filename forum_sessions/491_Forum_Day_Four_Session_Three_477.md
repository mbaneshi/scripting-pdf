Forum Day Four: Session Three 477
Nobody told her to do that: How did her actions change? What happened is this: Ellen’s actions
are perfectly correlated to the ball. They’re not perfectly correlated to the “is” ball; they’re
perfectly correlated to the occurring ball. See, you watch where the ball goes, and you’re sitting
out there observing, so the ball looks like it’s more or less diffi  cult to catch, it’s going more or
less fast, or whatever it’s doing, but that’s not what Ellen’s watching. What Ellen was watching
was the occurring ball. You get the diff erence between the two? At fi rst the ball occurred as
fast and small, and her actions were perfectly correlated with a small and fast ball. Later, after
she got oriented, the ball got bigger and slower. Instead of being up there like a threat, it was
fl oating up there, and she could reach up and catch the ball. Now I’m going to make the point
more clearly for you.
Erhard walked to the back of the podium to the table there to get a dictionary.
(walking back holding the dictionary)
So you can tell what the source of action is, we’re going to handle it with the dictionary. So
you’ve got to watch!
Erhard suddenly tossed it off  to one side into the audience. A participant caught it and then tossed it
back. This process was repeated several times.
ERHARD
Do you see any talent down there? Do you see any experience down there? Do you see any
know-how down there? No: just dictionaries fl ying and people’s hands moving. See how
that happens? No talent; no experience: just the dictionary and people’s hands moving. Is
that clear? Action is a correlate of the occurring. However the ball occurs, your actions will be
perfectly correlated. You get a truly uncoordinated person, or a person who calls themselves
uncoordinated, and you lob the ball at them... it doesn’t look like that. It looks like a pea
traveling at supersonic speed. You want to see a true athlete dealing with a pea traveling at
supersonic speed? I’ll show you how clumsy
they look.
Erhard then called for someone who was athletic to come up. Erhard began tossing the ball to this
participant, but threw it widely, to a point where he was unable to catch it. Erhard pointed out to the
group how “clumsy” the athletic participant looked.
(continuing)
That’s how the ball looks to somebody “clumsy,” where the ball occurs as uncatchable. He
acts like Ellen acts, like the occurring “uncatchable ball.” Actions are correlated to the ball as
occurring. Correlate is a diffi  cult word for people because we think in terms of “because,” or
“cause and eff ect.” Correlation is not cause and eff ect. His actions are perfectly correlated to the
ball as an occurring ball. Ellen’s actions are exactly the same: perfectly correlated to the ball as
occurring. Your actions in life, what you do at work, the way you act with your wife or husband,
the way you act with your friends, the way you act with things, are a correlate of the occurring.
become appearing in the second sense: an already prepared space.
Presence as an event of coming-to-presence is always coming-to-
presence, or it becomes constant presence.
To be always coming to presence, a being must be always
withdrawing. If a being’s existence in the world occurs as an event,
then each occurrence of the event must end with a return to the
state from which the event begins. The state from which an event
of Being begins is non-Being; therefore the happening of Being
must include non-Being as the context to which it can return and
from which it can begin.
This was the nature of the sway, where unconcealment always
returned to concealment, and meaninglessness was always the
context for meanings. In bringing the sway to stand in the world,
the pre-Socratics were creating a world in which beings did not
attain a state of constant presence, but were always wavering,
always “held out in a questioning manner into the possibility of
not-Being” (IM 31).
This wavering has been forgotten. Heidegger’s purpose, and
that of The Forum, is its recovery. ■

SPEAKING BEING
There’s no such thing as action, there’s only action-in-the-world; “world” as an occurring and
“action” are correlates of one another. That ball looked uncatchable to you. That’s how the ball
looks to somebody called “clumsy.” It looks uncatchable, and their actions are those of anybody
else, athletic or not, their actions are the same, because the actions are not a product of a
property inside one’s self called “athletic.” People’s actions are a correlate of the way the world
occurs for them. Anybody didn’t get that?
JERRY
I didn’t get it.
ERHARD
What didn’t you get? Did you get that we are talking about the source of action?
JERRY
I heard it.
ERHARD
There’s a diff erence between hearing and getting. Did you get that we’re talking about the
source of action? Is that clear to you?
JERRY
Yes.
ERHARD
So what didn’t you get? “I didn’t get...”
JERRY
I didn’t get that it’s the same thing when you throw the ball over there to him as when you
throw it to her and she doesn’t catch it.
ERHARD
That’s good. That’s clear. Now we can have a forwarding discussion. So, his actions down here
are correlated to an uncatchable ball, yes?
JERRY
Correlated to me means “goes along with.”
ERHARD
That’s close enough for the moment, yes. His actions are consistent with—go along
with—an uncatchable ball, yes?
JERRY
Yes.
