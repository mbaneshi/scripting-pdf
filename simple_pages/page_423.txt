...becomes the next problem, which you then solve, which becomes the next problem. So you’ve 
got to solve that one, which becomes the next problem. On and on and on: which is all racket,
by the way, and leaves you looking like this.

TIM
It seems that there are problems.
WES
It says up here “In life there are problems” that occur in languaging.
TIM
There are problems with solutions that don’t become problems.
WES
Really? Give me one.
TIM
I left my wallet where I bought a gift. And I came and sat down and realized I left my wallet.
I sat there and thought, “Gee, I don’t remember putting my wallet away.” I got up and went to 
check my coat and my wallet wasn’t there. So I left and went to the store...
WES
But this is a story. I don’t hear any problem in this. 
TIM
So you’re defi ning that losing a wallet is not a problem.
WES
No, not necessarily a problem.
TIM
Unless you say “it shouldn’t be.”
WES
Exactly. Losing a wallet is losing a wallet. Having cancer is having cancer. People are going to 
die. “Those people with cancer are going to die!” You are going to die.
TIM
What are the problems that are in life? Give me a problem in life?
The Drift 
The work of both Erhard and Heidegger is the generation and 
development (the teasing out) of primordial metaphors, which
may be held, for the purpose of this discussion, as what Erhard has
called distinctions (and more recently, “linguistic abstractions”),
the distinguishing of which unconceals new possibilities for Being-
in-the-world.
