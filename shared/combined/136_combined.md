SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
We’ll get to that. Here’s what I want you to get fi rst. Distinguishing establishes a domain of possi-
bility, is making possible, not giving form to, but making form possible; very important to get that
diff erence. Be in this conversation: distinction or distinguishing is an operation unlike defi ning, ex-
plaining. It does not lead to understanding. You do not understand two when you have distinguished
two. Distinction is an action which leads to power, because it creates possibility, which is freedom.

What is the diff erence between occurring and distinguishing?
ERHARD
Occurring happens in a realm distinguished. There are cultures in which, we are told, if you
show people a photographic image they don’t see it. These people, by the way, survive an
environment you would die in, so they’re probably not stupid. There’s no image on the paper
or in your brain. These cultures have never generated the possibility “photographic image,”
and so they see splotches on the paper. If you explain it to them, they don’t see an image but a
representation of an image. Where does the image happen? It happens in the distinction “pho-
tographic image.” In that domain of possibility arises “photographic image.”

I would like you to tease this out for me a bit more. Using the example, when you’re distin-
guishing two with any objects, and then it now occurs as two. So when you give me examples of
that, the occurrence now is determining how it occurs for me.
ERHARD
No. The defi nition is determining its occurring.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader
(
)r
So it’s a concept.
ERHARD
Yeah. And what you get is a conceptually driven occurring. And isn’t that the way you learned
mathematics? You weren’t creative or generative in mathematics. Mathematicians learn math at
the level of distinctions, not at the level of defi nition. Consequently, they invent numbers. They
are not limited by arithmetic; they are freed by arithmetic, because arithmetic is constituted
by distinctions not by defi nitions. Arithmetic is not conceptual for them. Art is conceptual for
most people. Artists don’t generate art conceptually. If they do, that’s not art. That’s handicraft,
not art. You can’t create out of concepts, defi nitions. Dancers don’t dance out of explanations of
dance. They generate it out of a domain of possibility in which they can invent forms. What’s
present when a dancer is dancing is an occurring allowed by the possibility, not an occurring
allowed by the conception. You start doing the same thing over and over again when your art is
reduced to a concept. That’s painting by the numbers.
Fundamentally, this thinking is a response to an appeal. The
appeal arises from the wavering in appearance of Being, from its
tendency in the act of appearing to disappear. “Nature loves to
hide,” says the common translation of a fragment of Heraclitus,
the pre-Socratic Greek thinker (Wheelwright 70), which Heidegger
retranslates to emphasize his reading of physis (pronounced foo’-
sis): “Being (emerging appearance) intrinsically inclines toward
self-concealment” (IM 126). Thus the essential—Being, that which
must be thought—turns away. Being withdraws. And although
Heidegger acknowledges that for contemporary humans this with-
drawal is now almost unnoticed, nevertheless as beings, we are.
Therefore at some level we are always turned toward that missing
aspect of our existence:
What withdraws from us, draws us along by its
very withdrawal, whether or not we become
aware of it immediately, or at all. Once we are
drawn into the withdrawal, we are drawing
toward what draws, attracts us by its with-
drawal. And once we, being so attracted, are
drawing toward what draws us, our essential
nature already bears the stamp of “drawing
toward.” (WCT 9)
“
This is the exigence in the background of our lives. We are drawn
toward the ongoing concealment of Being, and in being so drawn
we find ourselves pointing in its direction: “We are who we are by
pointing in that direction—not like an incidental adjunct but as . . .
an essential and therefore constant pointing toward what with-
draws” (WCT 9, emphasis added).
T
The way to draw toward that which withdraws is through
y
thinking, since “Being in general gets interpreted on the basis of
thinking” (IM 129), but not in the ordinary way we understand
thinking. To think is “to lend a hand to the essence, the coming to
presence, of Being” (“TT” in QCT 40). When we are thinking we are
T
looking and drawing toward what withdraws: “Whenever man is
properly drawing that way, he is thinking—even though he may
still be far away from what withdraws, even though the withdrawal

So occurrence can be constitutive of distinguishing?
ERHARD
No. The other way around and constitutive is not the right word. Allowed by is better. Occur-
ring is allowed by the distinction in which it occurs. The occurring is possible by virtue of the
domain of possibility which you have established. For instance, the photographic image doesn’t
occur in the brain or in the eyes. Those were operational before. The occurring happens in a
“house called possibility.” Possibility is a product of an operation called distinguishing.

I have a sense that there’s an architecture, or whatever word you want to use, so that in order
to objectify something, you have to be able to locate it, someplace, sometime, some form, some
architecture for defi nition. Is there an architecture for distinguishing?
ERHARD
I’m not clear about your use of the word architecture.

Anatomy or elements.
ERHARD
At one end of the spectrum is design, at the other end is making. Anatomy is at the making
end. What’s up at the design end, mostly lives in what will remain unsaid. Although present by
virtue of... all that...
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 2
(
)
Is it possible to elevate or transform a concept to a distinction, and create a possibility?
ERHARD
That’s moving from anatomy to design. When you deal with distinction, with design, there’s
something inherently satisfying about that. There’s something inherently satisfying in master-
ing something, and mastery and distinction are synonymous.
(to the group)
Whatever it is, what are you going to use it for? To look good. The problem is, you can’t use dis-
tinctions. Distinctions use you, you don’t use them. Distinctions give you. Not many people own
a yellow car, right?  Buy a yellow car and see how many yellow cars you see. We’re developing

may be as veiled as ever” (WCT 17). Therefore Heidegger says of
T
Socrates: “All through his life and right up to his death, Socrates
did nothing else than place himself into this draft , this current, and
maintain himself in it. That is why he is the purest thinker of the
West” (WCT 17).
T
The relationship of thinking to Being is easily conceived in
familiar Cartesian terms: “Being is the objective, the object. Think-
ing is the subjective, the subject. The relation of thinking to Being
is that of subject to object” (IM 150). Such a conception, however,
keeps us stuck in one of the primary dualities of metaphysical
thought. Heidegger finds an alternative view in a fragment from
the Greek thinker Parmenides: to gar auto noein estin te kai einai,
which has been translated, traditionally and (says Heidegger) inad-
equately, as “thinking and Being are the same” (IM 152). In fact, the
relation between thinking and Being is much subtler than simple
“identity,” and it is the development of the nature of this relation
which is at the center of Heidegger’s later thought. In Werner
Erhard’s work, this relation is explored persistently in the dialogue
of The Forum.
Heidegger emphasizes that the way to thinking is not think-
ing about thinking, a practice that has flourished in the West as
t
“logic” (WCT 21). Nor, even more fundamentally, is it the kind of
T
thinking which Nietzsche called “blinking,” the formation of ideas
which “present and propose of everything only the glitter, only the
appearance of surfaces and foreground facets” (WCT 82).
T
Merely having thoughts, for Heidegger, is “idea forming,”
and not at all what is involved in true thinking: “We understand,
of course, and consider it the most obvious thing in the world,
when someone says, ‘I think the matter is such and such,’ and
with it has in mind, ‘I have such and such an idea of the matter’”
(WCT 45). But we have not yet really thought what is involved
T
in idea-forming. That is, we have thought of “idea forming”
as “thinking,” but we have not yet thought of idea-forming as
idea-forming, that is, as a distinct mode of thinking. Thus we
have not thought something which is determinative of our very
existence:

SPEAKING BEING
THEODORE
How do you distinguish something without defi ning it?
ERHARD
Yeah. We’re going to get to that.
THEODORE
I got something about looking good. In being here I want this to be successful, and one of my
fears is not looking good, going home and seeing that nothing happened.
ERHARD
You’re not free and that will keep something from happening. So when you’re willing to be with
one of the possible outcomes–that nothing will happen–then you’re in a place where something
can happen to you. You see how strange that sounds? By being willing to have nothing happen
you are in a place where something can happen. Thanks.
(Theodore sits down)
Distinction is an operation in language. In the normal course of events, you and I think of
language as something we use to report on something. Language is for talking
t
about. It’s for
abouting. Describing and explaining are operations in language called reporting. We think that
there’s something out there that has a particular way it is, and I make a representation of it. And
if my representation is accurate, I can make it work. But now we’re distinguishing a new kind
of operation in language. It’s an operation in language called generating. It’s as though I said
“chair” and a chair came out of my mouth. Watch. You’re going to see this thing fall out of my
mouth as I say it: I promise. When I said “promise,” what fell out of my mouth was a promise.
When I say “I promise,” that’s a promise, isn’t it? What falls out of my mouth when I say “I
promise”? A promise. When I say “I promise,” a promise falls out of my mouth. All I want you to
see is there’s possibility in language that didn’t occur to you, because you hadn’t distinguished
language as a generative act. So we’re sneaking up on the answer to the question: what is the
operation by which one distinguishes? Not an operation in language like reporting, but creating.
Listen up. Apes are not stupid. But no ape has ever picked up a stick along a path because he
needed to knock down bananas. Why not? Because apes live in a world with no possibility; be-
cause they live without language. And I don’t mean laboratory apes. Laboratory apes are tainted
with language.
LOUISE
What about the hundredth monkey?
ERHARD
It’s totally false, that example. It’s bullshit, and demonstrated to be so. The author has acknowl-
edged that he wrote that to make a point. Lyall-Watson recanted that as scientifi c evidence. I
want to stop hearing that crap about the hundredth monkey.
That is, idea-forming shapes us, and thus “the essence of
idea-forming is probably the first thing that must be put into
the language of thinking” (WCT 55). This is the first step in the
T
appropriation of our current way of thinking: the recognition
and taking-over of that thinking, which is necessary before we
can attain a possibility beyond it.
This aspect of Heidegger’s thinking has been central through-
out its evolution, emerging in various iterations, from the reso-
luteness of Dasein in Being and Time to the gentler releasement
of his later work. It is also a central element in Werner Erhard’s
methodology. Both men posit the paradoxical idea that, rather
than resisting those aspects of ourselves that we see as in some
way problematic, we let them be, and own them, and thereby gain
a freedom to think beyond them. The idea is fundamental to the
transformation that both men are working to make available. ■
One might say, for instance: “I think it will
snow tonight.” But he who speaks that way is
not thinking, he just has views on something.
We must be very careful, however, not to
regard this “viewing” as insignificant. All our
daily life and all we do moves within what we
have in view, and necessarily so. (WCT 32)

LOUISE (continuing to object)t
Apes and dogs have language. So do rocks.
ERHARD
If everything’s got language there’s nothing to talk about, because nothing’s distinguished.
LOUISE
They are diff erent languages.
ERHARD
You’re making yourself stupid. You’re a fucking Californian. It’s that hundredth monkey shit.
You denigrate the great mysteries when you turn them into crap. Apes don’t have language. It’s
true that apes signal. But they don’t communicate. Rocks bump into each other, and animals
have a fancy form of bumping. But animals don’t have language, they have signals. Whatever it
is we’re distinguishing with the word language, it’s what human beings do. Apes don’t dwell in
possibility. To dwell in possibility you’ve got to have what I call language. I’m asserting some-
thing, and you can’t prove an assertion. You can disprove an assertion but you can’t prove it.
You can validate an assertion, and there’s a lot of evidence for that one. You can move without
language. Rocks move all the time. One distinguishes by an operation in language in which pos-
sibility is generated. And it’s generated by speaking and listening, and by what’s present without
being said by virtue of what is said. Let me give you an example.

Julie, give me some water please? She doesn’t come up and throw a bucket of water on me.
(to the group)
Where the hell is “in a bucket” or “in a glass”? It’s not in your brain. It’s in the conversation.
One of the possibilities in the domain of possibility called language is possibility itself. Two was
distinguished in the conversation we had for distinguishing distinction.
(moving to the chalkboard and drawing a series of marks)
Is this two?
LOUISE
It’s two.
(grouping the marks with two enclosing outlines)
Now it occurs as two. Two is there if you’ve got the possibility “two.” There’s an infi nite number
of ways to make that “two.”
LOUISE
But how do you do it?
ERHARD
It arises in language. Do you know how to ride a bicycle?

LOUISE
Yes.
ERHARD
How did you learn?
LOUISE
Just started to go and then discovered that my dad was not behind me.
ERHARD
That’s the story they say. But let me tell you how it happened. When you fi rst sit on a bicycle
all the sensations are the same. They all feel the same: they’re all falling. At some point some
sensations are falling and other sensations are not. They’re the same sensations you had when
you fi rst sat on the bicycle, but now some of them occur as falling and some as not falling. That
happens when the distinction balance is distinguished as a possibility. Now your father told
you, “you’ve got to balance. And balance is up like this.” That didn’t help. It all still felt like
falling. When the distinction balance is distinguished—not conceptualized—then some of the
sensations start to occur as balance, as not falling.
(pausing

)
There are no twelve easy steps to distinguishing. If you’re willing to engage in the conversation
there’s a possibility of distinguishing there. Distinction arises in the conversation. You just can’t
see conversation. Very useful conversation. Thank you.
ANOTHER PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 3

When you said “I promise,” a promise falls out of your mouth; if I had listened to you promise
twenty times and not keep your promise, then when you said the word “promise,” a promise
wouldn’t fall out of your mouth, just the word “promise” would.
ERHARD
Yeah. If you don’t keep your promise repeatedly, you create a no-possibility listening for promis-
ing, so that what falls out of your mouth is the word. So the possibility lives in the conversation.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 3

So the sacredness of a promise can only live in a conversation.

Yeah. And one of the things that fucks it up brutally is that bullshit about sincerity. Disgusting.

In mapping this conversation onto an area of my life where I have a rich body of distinctions,
things like skiing or leading The Forum, or being with my kids. Looking at my kids’ develop-
ment. It seems like there are three things in the conversation for distinguishing distinction. I
wanted to see if I’m tracking with it. One is that it’s almost entirely in what is unsaid. What’s
said is almost only because something needs to be said for there to be an unsaid.  The second is
that action is a necessary component.
ERHARD
Yeah, that would be misunderstood at this point. You can have an action in language too.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 4
(
)
The spoken conversation doesn’t necessarily need to be about what’s being distinguished.
ERHARD
That’s right. That’s what I read from Heidegger about leaving it the realm of the unsaid. Like in
the Karate Kid.
ANOTHER PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 5
(
)
I had participation as a defi nition, and it shifted over to a distinction. I started to listen diff erent-
ly. When you talked about being used by a distinction, two things happened. I recalled a movie I
saw called The Gods Must Be Crazy. There was no Coke bottle for them, but I get that there was
no not-Coke bottle for me. I’m here for a breakthrough in my commitment in my relationship
with my children and my wife. I’ve used up the context for my family.
ERHARD
Listen up here. You create a possibility for your family and when you use up that possibility,
and wonder where the juice went: What’s missing may not be more and better content. What’s
missing may be a new opening, a new possibility.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 5
(
)
And I could see that the conversation for extending the single dimension. There’s a new demand
for myself for generating distinction.
ERHARD
Something extraordinary opens up with a new realm of distinction. It’s not additive. It’s unrelat-
ed to what it was before. No persistence of the old.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 5

So now this isn’t news—the power of distinction—see I had that as a defi nition distinct from
HEIDEGGER’S PEDAGOGY
Here, despite the aff inities we are proposing between the thinking
of Heidegger and the work of Werner Erhard, we call attention to a
fundamental diff erence in the nature of their work. This diff erence
lies in the rhetorical form of their communication. In The Forum, the
model is not orator and audience, a commonplace view of rhetoric.
Rather, The Forum’s form, elements of which have emerged in the
various perspectives expressed in this book, is rhetorical dialogue, a
strategic transaction which has as its aim the inclusion of the dialogic
participants in the disclosive experience itself. Preservation, in this
model, stands in a diff erent relationship to disclosure: it becomes the
dwelling-within the work by those who have themselves participated
in the disclosive and creative act of communication.

distinguishing distinction. And then I saw that there’s a particular relationship that I’ve adopted.
I don’t see the incident, but I’ve got an already always listening, a new one I hadn’t seen before:
“this is theirs, not mine.” I can see now that’s been using my life. There’s an opening.
ERHARD
When you can see “it’s theirs, not mine,” then there’s a possibility beyond “it’s theirs, not mine.”
When you keep avoiding it, there is no possibility.
KYLE
What is the diff erence between diff erence and distinction?
ERHARD
Distinction is not dependent upon relationship, and diff erence is. Something that’s diff erent
is dependent upon that from which it is diff erent. I don’t see photons, I see people, although
what’s out there are photons. I don’t see with my eyes. I see with my mouth. That is to say, I
see with language. Things occur as they occur because of language. What distinguishing is, is
to take something like an undiff erentiated mass and to bring forth from that mass a realm of
possibility. Distinction gives existence. It makes existence possible. Distinctions aren’t depen-
dent on. They are kind of, of themselves. The eff ectiveness of someone who can deal from the
whole—and all that means is having the distinction—is very diff erent from someone who has
all the parts.
(Kyle sits down)
Why we had this whole discussion: so we can distinguish racket—so your racket occurs for
you as a racket. So that you’re not looking around for what fi ts the defi nition. I want it to show
up for you as a presence. I’m going to distinguish a racket. A racket’s got to be something that
you’re protesting, saying you don’t want to be doing or being. Something you wish you weren’t
doing, or trying not to do it. Like let’s say you’re being stupid. It’s not a racket if you say listen,
I’m being stupid on purpose, I get a lot out of being stupid. See when I’m stupid I don’t have to
be responsible for anything. That’s not a racket. A racket is where you are like, “I wish I wasn’t
so stupid!” That’s when it’s a racket. A racket has got to be something you’re doing or being that
you are protesting or resisting or that you don’t want to do or be. That’s what makes it a racket.
And what’s driving it is the payoff . You’re getting something out of being stupid—that’s your
racket. Like, “my family walks all over me, and I don’t want them to do that.” There’s a protest
there. Then what’s the payoff ? I get to feel sorry for myself. “Oh I see: that’s a racket.” What’s
driving you to be a way that your family walks all over you is the payoff  you get for having your
family walk all over you. And then there’s a cost. There are three elements to a racket. You’re
doing or being something that you’re protesting or resisting, but you’re still doing it. It’s persist-
ing and you’re protesting the persistence. The second element is the payoff . It’s the payoff  which
drives the racket. Rackets are not habits. Take the payoff  away, the racket disappears immediate-
ly. Being cranky is not a habit. Brushing your teeth is a habit. Pull all your teeth out, you’d brush
your teeth about three days. The payoff s are invariant and the costs are also always the same.
Someone give me an example.
The scholar John Anderson has observed that throughout his
work, Martin Heidegger is “urging his hearers and readers toward
a kind of transmutation of themselves. . .” (DT 12). Ronald Bruzina
locates this transmutation in a surrender to the direction of Heide-
gger’s thinking:
Heidegger is not attempting to formulate a
position, but rather to execute a movement. If
we realize now that this “movement” he exe-
cutes is not only always in language, but also
in a highly original and strange kind of word-
ing, then we are close to seeing that this very
immersion in a wording movement constitutes
thinking. (Ronald Bruzina, “Heidegger on the
Metaphor and Philosophy” 197)
“
Heidegger himself claimed that this direction of movement
requires a transformation, which “occurs as a passage. . . in which
one site is left  behind in favor of another. . . and that requires that
the sites be placed in discussion” (“DL” in OWL 42).
The critical element in this process was the passage. This point
was made again at the beginning of the lecture series later published
as On Time and Being, when Heidegger instructed his students on
the way of listening they should bring to the lectures in order that the
intended transformation might be achieved: “Let me give a little hint
on how to listen,” he said. “The point is not to listen to a series of prop-
ositions, but rather to follow the movement of showing” (OTB 2).
At the same time, Heidegger recognized the limitations of the
lecture format for achieving the transformation he sought. In con-
cluding this same lecture series, he acknowledged that “the form of a
lecture remains itself an obstacle. . . . The lecture has spoken merely in
propositional statements” (OTB 24). Neither, he suggested elsewhere,
is a “scientific dissertation” an appropriate medium for an inquiry into
language and Being, since “the movement of the questioning that is
called for here might too easily congeal” (“DL” in OWL 50, emphasis
added). Nor, he added, can “a transformation” be “established as the
consequence of an accumulation of the results of philosophical re-
search” (“DL” in OWL 42). For Heidegger as for Erhard, transformation
was a gestalt switch from one site of understanding to another, a leap.

It’s just not a racket if you’re up front about it. So if I say, hey Wes, I want to follow the rules in

Right, good. We’ll get into more examples, but fi rst I want to talk about the payoff s. If you’re
unhappy about something in your life, unhappiness is invariably a racket because there’s some-
thing that you are that you don’t want to be. Nobody wants to be unhappy. What’s the payoff ?
“Well there’s no payoff , it’s just terrible. I’m unhappy.” No, no. There’s a fucking payoff  in there.
And the payoff  is...

You’re protesting, but it persists... When you go home tonight and start to run your racket,

While Heidegger was committed to a transformation of
his students’ thinking about Being, he did not engage them as
individuals in a dialogue about the possibility of this transforma-
tion in their own lives—that is, in their own Being-in-the-world.
Heidegger’s student Gadamer has commented in an interview with
Ansgar Kemmann that Heidegger’s lectures, while astonishing in
their eff ects, were not explicit exchanges with his audience. In fact,
Gadamer has suggested that Heidegger’s relentless dedication to
the communication of his ideas, in many ways so gripping, actually
worked against his ability to engage the students in mutual con-
versation (“Heidegger as Rhetor” in HR 50).
An example of Heidegger’s pedagogical inquiry, consistent with
Gadamer’s observation, is given in Medard Boss’s account of Heide-
gger’s 1958 seminars at the Psychiatric University Clinic in Zurich.
Says Boss: “Only the participants of those first seminars are able
to estimate what endless eff ort it cost until his medical listeners,
trained solely in natural science, began to even suspect what Heide-
gger was trying to say” (Heidegger and Psychology 10). The following
y
exchange is a fragment from the transcript of one of the seminars.
Heidegger: What is distance?
Listener E: A definition of space.
Heidegger: What then is space as such?
(Ten long minutes of silence. . .)
Listener F: We have never heard such questions
and do not know what you regard as important,
what you want to hear, what you want to say.
Heidegger: I am only concerned that you open
your eyes and do not immediately dim and dis-
tort your vision once more with artificial sup-
positions or theoretical explanations. How is it,
then, with this matter that you have called an
interval of space?
(Seven minutes of silence. . .).

ERHARD
It’s as real as any soap opera ever got.
We can assume that the students in Heidegger’s philosophy classes
would have been more responsive. Yet the transcript suggests
that Heidegger, accustomed to the one-way communication form
of the lecture, seems not to have been practiced in prompting
dialogue. ■

ANGEL
But when I hurt over it, it’s not my decision to hurt over it.
ERHARD
Horseshit! Angel, listen up. When you walk out of here tonight, you are not going to be carrying
your divorce around with you.
ANGEL
I’ve had it for a long time.
(laughter)r
ERHARD
Wait. Wait. Listen to me.
(holding a director’s chair and dragging it across the stage, to laughter)r
See this is what you look like. And you wonder why are people looking at you funny. “What the
hell are they looking at? I don’t see anything funny.”
ANGEL
But that’s not my racket. I already picked out my racket.
ERHARD
Wait. Wait. Wait. You’re not a woman, you’re a woman who was divorced...
ANGEL
Twice.
(loud laughter)
ERHARD
Yeah, when you walk out of here, you won’t be carrying around your divorces anymore.
ANGEL
Are you telling me I won’t hurt about them anymore?
ERHARD
What hurts about them is carrying them around. Getting divorced does not hurt.
ANGEL
Yes it does.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD
No it doesn’t. And you’re a fucking racketeer and you’ve been carrying those goddamned di-
vorces around, and the pain, for the payoff . And after Kipp gets this distinguished when we get
back, you and I will have a little conversation. But we’ve got the ground established clearly. Do
we not? Look, you’re so frightened of losing that racket it’s got you really upset. You’re going to
be a real wrong lady when we’re done with the conversation. You will have spent years in pain
for nothing. You’re going to lose that whole justifi cation after being in pain. You’ll also lose all
that baggage you’ve been carrying around.
ANGEL
All that pain makes it worth something.
ERHARD
Ahhh. Emerging racket. Listen. There is a payoff . Yeah, you got to justify what happened. That’s
one of the payoff s. Self-justifi cation. Listen. I want you to be upset. I want you to be bothered.
I want you to stay that way until we talk after the break again. And I intend to insult you and
make you feel bad.
ANGEL
Thank you.
ERHARD
You’re welcome.
(laughter)r
Yeah, and I’m insulting you and making you feel bad because you are your divorces. And I have
no respect for your divorces. No respect for the story and no respect for the soap opera. And I
can’t fi nd any of you to respect there. Once we get some of you up, then I’ll have some respect.
Not insult. I’m insulting that crap.
ANGEL
There are a lot of people who respect me for my divorces, and my story about my divorces.
ERHARD
For certain, or you wouldn’t still be doing it otherwise. No one infl icts pain on themselves.
ANGEL
Then why are you accusing me of infl icting pain on myself?
ERHARD
Because you are. You’re listening to this like it’s your fault. I didn’t say it was your fault.
SOLICITUDE OF A FORUM LEADER
In Heideggerian terms, the Forum leader’s way of Being-with-The-
Forum participants is characterized as extreme positive solicitude.
Solicitude is Heidegger’s term for Dasein’s way of Be-
ing-with-Others who are themselves Dasein—that is, other human
beings. This is distinct from how Heidegger understands concern,
which indicates our way of being toward Things, or present-at-
hand entities (please see the sidebar “Concern” in Session Four of
Day One). Solicitude is an existentiale, which is to say, an aspect of
Dasein’s Being. “Thus in concernful solicitude the Other is proxi-
mally disclosed” (BT 161).
T
Throughout Being and Time, Heidegger introduces charac-
teristics of Dasein as occurring in various ways or “modes,” which
indicate that the characteristic generally shows up to a greater or
lesser degree, or in some cases not at all. Describing this feature of
Heidegger’s work, the book’s translators, John Macquarrie and Ed-
ward Robinson, comment: “It is as if zero and the negative integers
were to be thought of as representing ‘deficient modes of being a
positive integer’” (BT 42, note 1).
T
Heidegger tells us, for example, that solicitude, as a charac-
teristic of Being-with-one-another, maintains itself for the most
part in the “deficient and Indiff erent modes.” “Being for, against,
or without one another, passing one another by, not ‘mattering’ to
one another—these are possible ways of solicitude” (BT 158).
T
Because of the prevalence of these deficient modes, Dasein,
sensing a need to create factical human connection, has devised

ANGEL
Having this as a racket isn’t my fault?
ERHARD
No, the question of fault is... it isn’t somebody else’s fault either. And it’s your responsibility.
And as I’ve said, nobody knows what I’m talking about when I use the word responsibility, so
we’re not going to talk about that much anymore. Relax until we get back. You’ve been living
with the pain for however many years it’s been, another... while people take a break... You know,
peeing is very important to people... Peeing is more important to people than their lives. And
particularly more important than your life. If it was their life they might not have to pee, but
because it’s your life, they have to pee. So we’ll continue this after the break.
Erhard left the room, and Kipp came onto the platform. He moved to the blackboard and expanded
what Erhard had written about the structure of a racket:
right
g
dominates
justifi es itself
j
win
wrong   avoids domination        invalidates others      lose
KIPP
The payoff  expresses itself as: it always dominates, wins, or justifi es itself. Till you can get up
here on the board, I promise you nothing. The structure for the payoff , what keeps the payoff  in
place, is what’s up there on the board. The fi rst thing it costs you is your self-expression. Second,
the cost is any happiness in your life. You’re only happy to be right. The next cost is your vitality
or your health. And the fi nal cost of having your life be lived by your racket is the possibility of
love, of affi  nity.  You cannot put love, affi  nity, and being right together. If the cost gets bigger
than the payoff , you’ll give it up in a moment. That’s why in a tragedy you’ll be heroic: because
the cost is right there in your face. Angel has been too generous. She has given you the whole
mechanism. If she couldn’t be right about the pain what would she have to confront in her life?
Erhard joined Kipp on the platform.
ERHARD
Angel, the pain makes the divorces right. You getting a divorce was wrong, and the pain makes
it right. You’ve got the pain to make yourself right. That’s the payoff . What I’m asking you to see
is that the pain is not there because you got divorced. The pain is there to keep you from being
wrong about having been divorced. It works that way, doesn’t it?
ANGEL
Yes.
ERHARD
Never mind why it’s there. Forget that for the moment. Too hard to see that. If the pain weren’t
there you’d be very wrong wouldn’t you? You’d be a shallow nobody whose promises didn’t
ontic structures to correct the problem—empathy and “welfare
work” are two that Heidegger mentions. But he also points out that
these ontic solutions can never constitute or adequately replace
Being-with, since they overlook the fundamental ontological issue:
the deficiencies in the dominant modes of Being-with.
But solicitude has a positive mode as well, which Heidegger
calls extreme solicitude. This mode has two forms. On the one
hand, Dasein can leap in for the Other:
This kind of solicitude takes over for the Other
that with which he is to concern himself. The
Other is thus thrown out of his own position. .
. . In such solicitude the Other can become one
who is dominated and dependent, even if this
domination is a tacit one and remains hidden
from him. This kind of solicitude, which leaps
in and takes away ‘care,’ is to a large extent
determinative for Being with one another. . . .
(BT 158)
“
In normal circumstances, a Forum participant might expect to
receive that kind of sympathetic response to her circumstances,
such as the marital issues being described by this participant. But
Erhard’s solicitude in The Forum is of the second form:
[This is] a kind of solicitude which does not
so much leap in for the Other as leap ahead of
him . . . not in order to take away his ‘care’ but
rather to give it back to him authentically as
such for the first time. This kind of solicitude
pertains essentially to authentic care—that is,
to the existence of the Other, not to a “what”
with which he is concerned; it helps the Other
to become transparent to himself in his care
and to become free for it. (BT 158–159)
“
We find in Heidegger’s distinction here of extreme solicitude as
leaping ahead of the Other a profound characterization of the role
r
of a Forum leader. ■
134
SPEAKING BEING
mean anything, wouldn’t you? Yeah. So you need the pain to keep you from being wrong. At
least it works that way doesn’t it?
(She nods)
Good, that’s all I want you to see for the moment. I want you to see how godawful important
it is to look good. Now we’ve gotten looking good a lot more sharply defi ned. Looking good is
constituted by being right. Or having something you identify with as right. And having other
people and other things be wrong. Angel would tell you that people who get divorced easily and
don’t have any pain are wrong. I want you to see that it is so important that you’re willing to
suff er pain over a long period of time: intense pain over a long period of time that destroys your
happiness. Being right is so important, so sacred, that even a lot of pain over a long time is not
too much a price to pay to be right. I want you to see that this is not anything that would occur
to you normally. It would never ever in a million years occur to Angel that the pain made her
right, because that’s not the structure for interpretation in which we hold life. You and I have
invented a new structure of interpretation for life: racket. Getting divorced does not produce
pain. Having your child die does not produce pain. Rackets produce pain. What happens never
produces pain. If you lose a child and you’re sad, that heals the loss, and that’s not a racket.
Authentic sadness heals the loss, then the loss diminishes, then the sadness, and fi nally it’s
complete. But not in a racket: where life becomes about being sad. It’s very hard to see this, and
that’s why you need to distinguish this possibility powerfully so that what was a soap opera, a
drama, which is very real and valid, can be seen for what it is, namely a racket. That isn’t going
to be easy for you to do, so you need to listen up with the distinguishing.
(indicating Angel)
You and I are not fi nished. After the break.
Kipp set up paired shares. The Forum Supervisor announced the beginning of the break at 3:50 pm.

SPEAKING BEING
SESSION TWO INTERVAL
The Forgetting of Being, Part One of Eight: Getting and Losing
In November 2013, while this book was in development, we delivered a presenta-
tion about it as members of a panel at the National Communication Association
conference in Washington DC. Our thesis was that the ontological discourse of The
Forum provides participants with direct access to an experience of Being. Following
the presentation, an audience member asked this question: Aft er participants have
undergone the experience of Being that The Forum makes available, what becomes
of that experience? Does it persist?
This is obviously a central question for any consideration of Erhard’s work.
From its inception as the est Training, there has been a persistent quality of elusive-
t
ness, and therefore of mystery,
y about the transformation this work makes available.
People do not leave The Forum having gained the kind of cognitive understanding
we generally expect from an educational process. The result, instead, is that by en-
gaging in the conversation that occurs in The Forum, participants have “gotten it,” in
somewhat the way that one gets a joke. Heidegger characterizes such a phenome-
non as undergoing an experience with language, which means that language “befalls
us, strikes us, comes over us, overwhelms us and transforms us” (“NL” in OWL 57).
The process is not linear; Erhard has described it as not getting it for a long
time, and then getting it all at once. But there is at the same time a recognition that
what you’re suddenly seeing is a truth you’d already always known at some level.
Heidegger characterized it as “a leap” onto the ground on which we are already
standing (WCT 233), and Erhard has characterized it in similar terms: “I can’t have it
T
and give it to you. But I can communicate in a way so that you get an opportunity to
realize that you have it yourself already. Essentially, this is what the est Training [and
t
later The Forum] was developed to do” (Bartley 169).
y
Heidegger’s German word for this kind of experience is Augenblick. The usual
translation is instant, moment, or split second; but Hubert Dreyfus says that in Heide-
gger’s use, the word is more appropriately rendered as moment of vision or transfor-
mation (BT, note 376; Dreyfus,
T
Being-in-the-World 321). In
d
Being and Time, Heidegger
uses the word to designate the gestalt switch that occurs when a human being takes
resolute ownership of his life and an authentic existence becomes possible (BT 387).
T
Since the experience of The Forum is not understood in the usual way, neither
is it retained in memory in the way that cognitive understanding is. Being can be
communicated, and the results reported by Forum participants give evidence that
its communication is experienced as transformative; but a quality of elusiveness
persists in the way that transformative experience is retained. Further, according to
Erhard, the elusiveness is to be expected. “That’s the way it’s supposed to happen,”
he tells The Forum participants. “Getting and losing.”
Why the elusiveness? What is it about Being that leads it to withdraw—as it
has withdrawn over two millennia from the human experience of existence; and as
it withdraws repeatedly during The Forum dialogue as Erhard and the participants
struggle to bring it to presence?
Heidegger has provided a response to this question in a series of lectures he
delivered at the University of Freiburg in 1935. Published in 1959 under the title An
Introduction to Metaphysics, these lectures became his first book-length work to be
translated into English. He later extended his thinking on the subject in four essays,
published in 1975 as Early Greek Thinking. In these volumes, Heidegger locates the
source of Being’s withdrawal at the point of its first emergence. He calls this junc-
ture the beginning of history—the moment when the West’s first philosophers were
beginning to think about the nature of Being, and to understand themselves as
world-creators.
But in Heidegger’s account, Western thinking, at its very inception, failed to
capture the truth of Being in language. As a consequence, Being, and what its
experience might make available, has been lost to us, and so thoroughly that even
its conceptualization defies our thinking. What does Heidegger see as possible
if human access to Being was restored? He says that we would be opened to the
epiphany of a world (IM 69)—our everyday perceptions and experiences would occur
newly, in a context of possibility that is not present in our current view of things.
This context of possibility, he says, was available to humans in one brief
moment of history. What became of Being? In this series on the forgetting of Being,
during Intervals between sessions, we will present Heidegger’s account.
138
SPEAKING BEING
The Forum resumed at 4:20 pm. Kipp returned to the platform and called for participants to share
what they had discovered about their rackets.
KIPP
We asked you to distinguish sharing yourself. The time in The Forum for explaining your life is
f
over.
JODIE
I want a relationship.
KIPP
Are you sharing or talking about?
JODIE
I don’t know.
KIPP
My racket is... My payoff  is... The way my racket shows up in my life is... Share the juice.
JODIE
My racket is that I want a relationship. And every time one appears I sabotage it, so that it
doesn’t happen.
KIPP
What’s the truth?
JODIE
I’m not in a relationship.
KIPP
No. What’s authentic is “if I had a relationship, I’d be wrong. What gets me up in the morning is
how I can avoid being in a relationship.” And the racket is that you say what?
JODIE
That I want a relationship.
KIPP
Who do you get sucked into the racket? There’s a distinction called “on the court.” There’s
another distinction called “up in the stands talking about what’s on the court.” What your life is
about is not having a relationship. How do you feel about that?
FORUM DAY TWO:
SESSION THREE
Forum Day Two: Session Three
139
JODIE
Cheated.
KIPP
That was on the court. You could hear that. Who has to pay for your not having a relationship?
JODIE
Everyone in my life.
KIPP
If you’re not cheated, you don’t know who to be in life. Maybe there is no being authentic.
Maybe the best there is, is being authentic about your own inauthenticity. Being related is much
more risky than being unrelated. You’ve got to be there in the presence of being human.
JODIE
I got it.
KIPP
Don’t be so quick to get it. See, I don’t think you got it. I don’t think you got the dagger in your
heart. What’s your racket an excuse for? You don’t have to reveal yourself. You don’t have to
create a relationship. What persistent condition do you complain about? A cheated person has
to look like a cheated person. You can’t have love in your life or you’d be wrong. What today’s
about is beginning to be in the presence of your own life.
JODIE
I want to get beyond this.
KIPP
There is no getting beyond it. That’s more California. The opportunity is to be with it. Maybe
there is no getting beyond your racket. Maybe the only dignity is in owning it.
The participant, Mike, who earlier in the day had interacted with Erhard about “knowing how to
walk,” raised his hand.
MIKE
I don’t know what my racket is. I’m lost.
(laughter)r
KIPP
What case are you pleading?
140
SPEAKING BEING
MIKE
I don’t know.
KIPP
Look at your life. What is your life about? What is something that if you could do, you’d do it?
MIKE
I would have everybody like me.
KIPP
But...
MIKE
But if they get to know me, they stop listening to me after ninety seconds.
KIPP
When you are in the presence of another human being, what’s there?
MIKE
I look at the ceiling.
KIPP
Do you feel stupid?
MIKE
Yes.
KIPP
What happened when you were young?
MIKE
I tried to get in with a crowd of kids at school. I tried to blend in. A good friend of mine turned
away and cut me out of the circle.
KIPP
Any others?
MIKE
When I was sweeping. Ten-years-old. My dad said I didn’t sweep well. I wasn’t smart enough to
sweep.
Forum Day Two: Session Three
141
KIPP
“I’m not smart enough to sweep” never happened.
Erhard joined Kipp on the platform.
ERHARD
Mike, it’s something you became. Did “I’m not smart enough to sweep” ever happen?
The tone here was very quiet and still—the interaction was delicate, Mike somehow fragile.
MIKE
I don’t understand; I need more clarifi cation. I know that I missed places.
ERHARD
Did it happen that you missed places?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
Did it happen that your father pointed out where you missed?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
Did “I’m not smart enough to sweep” ever happen?
MIKE
I guess not.
ERHARD
What do you mean, you guess? Guess is part of your racket about being stupid. I want you to get
something: you became “I’m not even smart enough to sweep.” You didn’t just think it. You didn’t
”
just have that thought. You became “I’m not smart enough to sweep.” You made yourself into
“I’m not smart enough to sweep.”
Erhard sat on the edge of the platform facing Mike. The room was very still. Kipp sat nearby on the
platform edge.
MIKE
I became “I’m not smart enough to sweep.”

"هویت" ، و این توسعه ماهیت این رابطه است
که در مرکز فکر بعدی هایدگر است. در ورنر
کار Erhard ، این رابطه به طور مداوم در گفتگو مورد بررسی قرار می گیرد
از انجمن هایدگر تأکید می کند که روش تفکر تفکر نیست-
در مورد تفکر ، عملی که در غرب شکوفا شده است
حرف
"منطق" (WCT 21). و نه ، حتی اساساً ، این نوع است
حرف
فکر کردن که نیچه "چشمک زن" خوانده است ، شکل گیری ایده ها
که "ارائه و پیشنهاد همه چیز فقط زرق و برق ، فقط
ظاهر سطوح و جنبه های پیش زمینه "(WCT 82). t
صرفاً داشتن افکار ، برای هایدگر ، "ایجاد ایده" است ، "
و اصلاً آنچه در تفکر واقعی دخیل نیست: "ما می فهمیم ،
البته ، و آن را بدیهی ترین چیز در جهان در نظر بگیرید ،
وقتی کسی می گوید ، "من فکر می کنم موضوع چنین و چنین است" ، و
با توجه به این نکته ، "من چنین و چنین ایده ای از موضوع دارم" "
(WCT 45). اما ما هنوز واقعاً فکر نکرده ایم که چه چیزی درگیر است
حرف
در ایجاد ایده. یعنی ما به "شکل گیری ایده" فکر کرده ایم
به عنوان "فکر کردن" ، اما ما هنوز به فکر شکل گیری فکر نکرده ایم
ایجاد ایده ، یعنی به عنوان یک روش تفکر مشخص. بنابراین ما
فکر نکرده اند چیزی که تعیین کننده ما باشد

تئودور
چگونه می توانید چیزی را بدون استفاده از آن متمایز کنید؟ درز
بله ما می خواهیم به آن برسیم. تئودور
من در مورد خوب به نظر می رسم در اینجا بودن می خواهم این موفقیت آمیز باشد و یکی از من
ترس ها خوب به نظر نمی رسد ، به خانه می روید و می بینید که هیچ اتفاقی نیفتاده است. درز
شما آزاد نیستید و این اتفاق از اتفاق می افتد. بنابراین وقتی می خواهید با او باشید
یکی از نتایج احتمالی - که هیچ اتفاقی نخواهد افتاد - پس در جایی هستید که چیزی در آن قرار دارد
می تواند برای شما اتفاق بیفتد می بینید که چقدر عجیب به نظر می رسد؟ با تمایل به هیچ اتفاقی
شما در مکانی هستید که اتفاقی می تواند رخ دهد. ممنون (تئودور نشسته است)
تمایز عملیاتی در زبان است. در دوره عادی وقایع ، من و شما به آن فکر می کنیم
زبان به عنوان چیزی که ما برای گزارش در مورد چیزی استفاده می کنیم. زبان برای صحبت کردن است
حرف
درباره این برای
در مورد توصیف و توضیح عملیات به زبان به نام گزارشگری است. ما فکر می کنیم که
چیزی در آنجا وجود دارد که روش خاصی دارد ، و من نمایندگی از آن را ارائه می دهم. وت
اگر نمایندگی من دقیق باشد ، می توانم آن را عملی کنم. اما اکنون ما یک نوع جدید را متمایز می کنیم
بهره برداری در زبان. این یک عمل به زبان به نام تولید است. انگار گفتم
"صندلی" و یک صندلی از دهان من بیرون آمد. ساعت شما می خواهید ببینید که این چیز از من خارج می شود
دهان همانطور که می گویم: قول می دهم. وقتی گفتم "قول" ، آنچه از دهان من افتاد ، یک وعده بود. وقتی می گویم "من قول می دهم" ، این یک وعده است ، اینطور نیست؟ وقتی می گویم "من" چه چیزی از دهانم می افتد
وعده "؟ یک وعده. وقتی می گویم" قول می دهم "یک وعده از دهانم خارج می شود. تمام آنچه شما می خواهم
ببینید آیا این امکان وجود دارد که به زبان شما رخ نداده باشد ، زیرا شما متمایز نشده اید
زبان به عنوان یک عمل تولیدی. بنابراین ما در حال پاسخ دادن به پاسخ این سؤال هستیم: چیست؟
عمل توسط کدام یک متمایز است؟ عملیاتی در زبان مانند گزارش نیست ، بلکه ایجاد است. گوش کن میمون ها احمق نیستند. اما هیچ میمون تاکنون چوب را در یک مسیر انتخاب نکرده است زیرا او
نیاز به ضرب و شتم موزها داشت. چرا نه؟ زیرا میمون ها در دنیایی زندگی می کنند و امکان پذیر نیست. be-
آنها بدون زبان زندگی می کنند. و منظور من میمون های آزمایشگاهی نیست. میمون های آزمایشگاهی لکه دار هستند
با زبان لوئیز
در مورد میمون صدم چطور؟ درز
این مثال کاملاً نادرست است. این گلوله است ، و نشان داده شده است. نویسنده تصدیق کرده است
به این نتیجه رسید که او آن را نوشت تا یک نکته را بیان کند. لیال واتسون به عنوان شواهد علمی C این امر را دوباره به دست آورد. من
می خواهید جلوی شنیدن آن تلخه در مورد میمون صدمین را بگیرید. یعنی ایده شکل ما را شکل می دهد ، و بنابراین "جوهر
ایجاد ایده احتمالاً اولین چیزی است که باید در آن قرار گیرد
زبان تفکر "(WCT 55). این اولین قدم در
حرف
تخصیص روش تفکر فعلی ما: شناخت
و گرفتن این تفکر ، که قبل از ما لازم است
می تواند فراتر از آن را بدست آورد. این جنبه از تفکر هایدگر مهم بوده است
تکامل آن ، که در تکرارهای مختلف ظاهر می شود ، از reso-
لوتین دازین در وجود و زمان به خوشحال کننده ملایم
از کار بعدی او همچنین یک عنصر اصلی در ورنر ارهارد است
روش شناسی هر دو مرد این ایده پارادوکسیکال را مطرح می کنند.
از مقاومت در برابر آن جنبه های خودمان که در بعضی ها می بینیم
با مشکل ساز ، ما به آنها اجازه می دهیم که آنها باشند ، و آنها را به دست می آوریم و از این طریق به دست می آوریم
آزادی فکر کردن به فراتر از آنها. این ایده برای
دگرگونی که هر دو مرد در تلاشند تا در دسترس باشند. ■
به عنوان مثال ممکن است کسی بگوید: "من فکر می کنم چنین خواهد شد
امشب برف. " اما کسی که از این طریق صحبت می کند
فکر نکند ، او فقط در مورد چیزی دیدگاه دارد. ما باید بسیار مراقب باشیم ، با این حال ، نه
این "مشاهده" را ناچیز در نظر بگیرید. همه ما
زندگی روزمره و همه کارهایی که انجام می دهیم در کاری که ما انجام می دهیم
در نظر داشته باشید ، و لزوماً چنین است. (WCT 32)

میمون ها و سگ ها زبان دارند. سنگها را هم همینطور انجام دهید. درز
اگر همه چیز به زبان آمده است ، هیچ چیز برای صحبت کردن وجود ندارد ، زیرا هیچ چیز متمایز نیست. لوئیز
آنها زبانهای مختلفی هستند. درز

شما ، "شما باید تعادل برقرار کنید. و تعادل مانند این است." این کمکی نکرد. همه چیز هنوز هم احساس می شود

احساسات به عنوان تعادل شروع می شوند ، زیرا در حال سقوط نیست. (مکث

هیچ دوازده قدم آسان برای تمایز وجود ندارد. اگر مایل به شرکت در گفتگو هستید

وقتی گفتید "من قول می دهم" ، یک قول از دهان شما خارج می شود. اگر من به شما قول داده بودم قول داده ام
بیست بار و قول خود را حفظ نکنید ، پس وقتی کلمه "قول" را گفتید ، یک وعده
فقط کلمه "وعده" از دهان شما بیرون نمی آید. درز
بله اگر قول خود را به طور مکرر حفظ نکنید ، شما یک امکان پذیرش برای وعده ایجاد می کنید-
این کلمه است که آنچه از دهان شما خارج می شود کلمه است. بنابراین امکان در گفتگو زندگی می کند. شرکت کننده (رهبر انجمن 3

در نقشه برداری از این مکالمه بر روی منطقه ای از زندگی من که در آن من یک بدنه غنی از تمایزات دارم ،
مواردی مانند اسکی یا رهبری انجمن ، یا بودن در کنار بچه هایم. با نگاهی به توسعه بچه های من-
مربی. به نظر می رسد سه چیز در گفتگو برای تمایز تمایز وجود دارد. من
می خواستم ببینم که آیا من با آن پیگیری می کنم. یکی این است که تقریباً کاملاً در آنچه ناگفته است. چه چیزی
سعید تقریباً فقط به این دلیل است که باید چیزی گفته شود که در آنجا ناگفته باشد. دوم است
این عمل یک مؤلفه ضروری است. درز
بله ، در این مرحله اشتباه درک می شود. شما می توانید در زبان نیز یک عمل انجام دهید. شرکت کننده (رهبر انجمن 4
(
)
گفتگوی گفتاری لزوماً در مورد آنچه متمایز است ، لازم نیست. درز
درست است این همان چیزی است که من از هایدگر در مورد ترک آن قلمرو ناگفته خواندم. مانند در
بچه کاراته. یکی دیگر از شرکت کنندگان (رهبر انجمن 5
(
)
من به عنوان یک مشارکت مشارکت داشتم و به یک تمایز تغییر یافت. من شروع به گوش دادن به تفاوت در
لاین وقتی در مورد استفاده از یک تمایز صحبت کردید ، دو اتفاق افتاد. من یک فیلم را به یاد آوردم
اره ای به نام خدایان باید دیوانه باشد. هیچ بطری کک برای آنها وجود نداشت ، اما من می دانم که وجود دارد
نه بطری دلخراش برای من. من برای دستیابی به موفقیت در تعهد خود در رابطه خودم اینجا هستم
با فرزندانم و همسرم. من از متن برای خانواده ام استفاده کرده ام. درز
اینجا گوش کن شما برای خانواده خود امکان ایجاد می کنید و وقتی از این امکان استفاده می کنید ،
و تعجب می کنید که آب آن به کجا رفت: آنچه از دست رفته ممکن است بیشتر و بهتر باشد. چه چیزی
گم شدن ممکن است یک افتتاح جدید باشد ، یک احتمال جدید. شرکت کننده (رهبر انجمن 5

و می توانم ببینم که مکالمه برای گسترش ابعاد واحد. تقاضای جدیدی وجود دارد
برای خودم برای ایجاد تمایز. درز
چیزی خارق العاده با قلمرو جدید تمایز باز می شود. این افزودنی نیست غیر امنی است-
به آنچه قبلاً بود هیچ پایداری قدیمی نیست. شرکت کننده (رهبر انجمن 5

بنابراین اکنون این خبر نیست - قدرت تمایز.
تعلیم و تربیت هایدگر
در اینجا ، علی رغم مواردی که ما بین تفکر پیشنهاد می کنیم
از هایدگر و کار ورنر ارهارد ، ما توجه را به یک
تفاوت اساسی در ماهیت کارشان. این تفاوت
نهفته در شکل بلاغی ارتباطات آنها. در انجمن ،
مدل Orator و مخاطب نیست ، منظره ای معمول از لفاظی است. در عوض ، شکل انجمن ، عناصری که در آن ظاهر شده اند
دیدگاههای مختلفی که در این کتاب بیان شده است ، گفتگوی بلاغی است ، a
معامله استراتژیک که به عنوان هدف خود گنجاندن گفتگو است
شرکت کنندگان در تجربه افشای خود. حفظ ، در این
مدل ، در یک رابطه متفاوت با افشای اطلاعات قرار دارد: این تبدیل می شود
ساکن با کار کسانی که خودشان شرکت کرده اند
در عمل افشای و خلاق ارتباطات. 128
وجود
تمایز تمایز. و بعد دیدم که رابطه خاصی وجود دارد که من اتخاذ کرده ام. من این حادثه را نمی بینم ، اما من همیشه گوش می دهم ، یک مورد جدید که قبلاً ندیده بودم:
"این مال آنهاست ، نه مال من." اکنون می توانم ببینم که از زندگی من استفاده کرده است. یک دهانه وجود دارد درز
وقتی می توانید "این مال من باشد ، نه مال من" ، پس از آن می توان فراتر از "این مال آنهاست ، نه مال من".
وقتی از آن اجتناب می کنید ، امکان وجود ندارد. کایل
تفاوت بین تفاوت و تمایز چیست؟ درز
تمایز به رابطه بستگی ندارد و تفاوت آن است. چیزی که متفاوت است
وابسته به آن است که از آن متفاوت است. من فوتون ها را نمی بینم ، من مردم را می بینم ،
آنچه در آنجا وجود دارد فوتون ها. من با چشمانم نمی بینم. من با دهانم می بینم. یعنی من
با زبان ببینید. اتفاقات به دلیل زبان رخ می دهد. آنچه متمایز است ، این است
برای به دست آوردن چیزی مانند یک توده غیرقانونی و برای بیرون آوردن از آن توده ای از قلمرو
امکان تمایز وجود دارد. این وجود را امکان پذیر می کند. تمایزات depen-
دندانه دار آنها نوع خود هستند. اثربخشی کسی که می تواند از آن برخورد کند
کل - و همه این معنی است که تمایز دارد - با کسی که دارد بسیار متفاوت است
تمام قسمت ها (کایل می نشیند)
چرا این کل بحث را داشتیم: بنابراین می توانیم راکت را متمایز کنیم - بنابراین راکت شما برای
شما به عنوان یک راکت به طوری که شما به دنبال این نیستید که چه چیزی را از بین ببرید. من می خواهم آن را نشان دهد
برای شما به عنوان یک حضور من می خواهم یک راکت را متمایز کنم. یک راکت باید چیزی باشد که
شما اعتراض می کنید ، می گویید که نمی خواهید انجام دهید یا بودن. چیزی که آرزو می کنید نبودید
انجام ، یا تلاش برای انجام آن. مثل اینکه بگوییم احمق هستید. اگر بگویید گوش دهید ، این یک راکت نیست ،
من به عمد احمق هستم ، از احمق بودن بسیار دور می شوم. ببینید وقتی احمق هستم مجبور نیستم
مسئول هر چیزی باشید. این یک راکت نیست یک راکت همان جایی است که شما مانند آن هستید ، "ای کاش من نبودم
خیلی احمقانه! " این یک راکت است.
شما اعتراض می کنید یا مقاومت می کنید یا نمی خواهید انجام دهید یا باشید. این همان چیزی است که آن را راکت می کند. و آنچه را که رانندگی می کند بازپرداخت است. شما از احمق بودن چیزی می گیرید - این مورد شماست
راکت مانند ، "خانواده من در سرتاسر من قدم می زنند ، و من نمی خواهم آنها این کار را انجام دهند." یک اعتراض وجود دارد
آنجا پس بازپرداخت چیست؟ برای خودم احساس پشیمانی می کنم. "اوه من می بینم: این یک راکت است." چه چیزی
شما را به سمت راهی که خانواده شما در سراسر شما قدم می زند ، بازپرداخت شما برای داشتن خود است
خانواده در سراسر شما قدم می زنند. و پس از آن هزینه ای وجود دارد سه عنصر به یک راکت وجود دارد. شما
انجام یا کاری که به آن اعتراض می کنید یا مقاومت می کنید ، اما هنوز هم این کار را انجام می دهید. این پایدار است-
و به پایداری اعتراض می کنید. عنصر دوم بازپرداخت است. این بازپرداخت است که
راکت را رانندگی می کند. راکت ها عادت نیستند. بازپرداخت را از بین ببرید ، راکت فوری ناپدید می شود-
لاین خنجر بودن عادت نیست. مسواک زدن دندانهای خود یک عادت است. تمام دندان های خود را بیرون بکشید ، برس می کنید
دندان های شما حدود سه روز. بازپرداخت S ثابت است و هزینه ها نیز همیشه یکسان هستند. کسی به من مثال می زند. محقق جان اندرسون مشاهده کرده است که در طول خود
کار ، مارتین هایدگر "از شنوندگان و خوانندگان خود به سمت
نوعی انتقال از خود. بشر . " (DT 12)
این انتقال را به صورت تسلیم به جهت هاید-
فکر گگر:
هایدگر در تلاش برای تدوین A نیست
موقعیت ، بلکه برای اجرای یک حرکت. اگر
ما اکنون متوجه می شویم که این "جنبش" او
برش ها نه تنها در زبان ، بلکه همچنین در زبان است
در یک کلمه بسیار اصیل و عجیب و غریب-
، پس ما نزدیک هستیم که ببینیم این خیلی
غوطه وری در یک جنبش جمله ای تشکیل شده است
فکر کردن (رونالد بروزینا ، "هایدگر در
استعاره و فلسفه "197)
"
خود هایدگر ادعا کرد که این جهت حرکت
نیاز به تحول دارد ، که "به عنوان یک گذرگاه اتفاق می افتد.
یک سایت به نفع دیگری باقی مانده است. بشر بشر و این به آن نیاز دارد
سایت ها در بحث قرار می گیرند "(" DL "در OWL 42) عنصر مهم در این فرآیند گذرگاه بود. این نکته
دوباره در ابتدای سریال سخنرانی که بعداً منتشر شد ساخته شد
همانطور که در زمان و هستی ، وقتی هایدگر به دانش آموزان خود دستور داد
راه گوش دادن آنها باید به سخنرانی ها برسند تا
تحول در نظر گرفته شده ممکن است حاصل شود: "بگذارید کمی اشاره کنم
وی گفت: "در مورد نحوه گوش دادن ،" نکته این است که به یک سری برنامه گوش دهید
ots ها ، بلکه برای پیروی از حرکت نمایش "(OTB 2). در همان زمان ، هایدگر محدودیت های موجود را تشخیص داد
فرمت سخنرانی برای دستیابی به تحولی که وی به دنبال داشت. در
او با بیان این مجموعه سخنرانی مشابه ، اذعان کرد که "شکل a
سخنرانی خود مانعی است. بشر بشر بشر این سخنرانی صرفاً در
اظهارات گزاره ای "(OTB 24). نه ، او در جای دیگر پیشنهاد نکرد ،
یک "پایان نامه علمی" یک رسانه مناسب برای تحقیق در مورد است
زبان و هستی ، از آنجا که "حرکت سؤال که است
فراخوانده در اینجا ممکن است خیلی راحت به راحتی محاصره شود "(" DL "در جغد 50 ، تأکید
اضافه شده) وی افزود ، و همچنین نمی تواند "تحول" به عنوان "ایجاد شود"
نتیجه تجمع نتایج فلسفی دوباره
جستجو "(" DL "در OWL 42). برای هایدگر در مورد Erhard ، تحول

شما اعتراض می کنید ، اما این همچنان ادامه دارد ... وقتی امشب به خانه می روید و شروع به اجرای راکت خود می کنید ،
من می خواهم که مثل یک راکت برای شما حضور داشته باشد ، نه مثل برخی از اپرا های صابون لعنتی در مورد "شما
ناراضی "؛ برای شما بیشتر مانند" من اینگونه هستم زیرا من چیزی را از آن خارج می کنم. وت
در حالی که هایدگر متعهد به تحول بود
فکر دانش آموزانش در مورد بودن ، او آنها را درگیر نکرد
افراد در گفتگو درباره احتمال این تحول-
در زندگی خودشان-یعنی به خودشان در جهان. دانش آموز هایدگر گادامر در مصاحبه با
Ansgar Kemmann که سخنرانی هایدگر است ، در حالی که حیرت انگیز است

گادامر پیشنهاد کرده است که فداکاری بی امان هایدگر به
ارتباط عقاید او ، از بسیاری جهات ، در واقع بسیار گیر است
در برابر توانایی خود در درگیر کردن دانش آموزان در متقابل کار کرد
متن ("هایدگر به عنوان بلاغت" در HR 50). نمونه ای از پرس و جوهای آموزشی هایدگر ، مطابق با
مشاهدات گادامر ، در حساب Medard Boss از هاید ارائه شده است
سمینارهای 1958 گگر در کلینیک دانشگاه روانپزشکی در زوریخ. رئیس می گوید: "فقط شرکت کنندگان در آن سمینارهای اول قادر هستند
برای برآورد هزینه های بی پایان آن تا زمانی که شنوندگان پزشکی وی هزینه داشته باشد ،

شنونده F: ما هرگز چنین سؤالاتی را نشنیده ایم
و نمی دانید که شما چه مهم می دانید ،
آنچه می خواهید بشنوید ، آنچه می خواهید بگویید. هایدگر: من فقط نگران این هستم که شما باز کنید
چشمان خود را و بلافاصله کم نور نکنید

فرشته
داشتن این به عنوان راکت تقصیر من نیست؟ درز
نه ، سوال تقصیر این است ... این تقصیر شخص دیگری نیست. و این مسئولیت شماست و همانطور که گفتم ، هیچ کس نمی داند وقتی از کلمه مسئولیت استفاده می کنم ، درباره چه چیزی صحبت می کنم ، بنابراین
ما دیگر نمی خواهیم در مورد آن صحبت کنیم. استراحت کنید تا برگردیم. شما زندگی کرده اید
با درد برای هر چند سال گذشته ، دیگری ... در حالی که مردم استراحت می کنند ... می دانید ،
Peeing برای مردم بسیار مهم است ... Peeing برای مردم از زندگی آنها مهمتر است. وت
به خصوص مهمتر از زندگی شما. اگر این زندگی آنها بود ، آنها ممکن است مجبور نشوند ، اما
از آنجا که این زندگی شما است ، آنها باید پوست بگیرند. بنابراین ما این کار را بعد از استراحت ادامه خواهیم داد. ارهارد از اتاق خارج شد و کیپ روی سکو آمد. او به تخته سیاه حرکت کرد و گسترش یافت
آنچه Erhard در مورد ساختار یک راکت نوشت:
حق
جف
تسلط دارد
خود توجیهی
j
پیروز شدن
اشتباه از سلطه جلوگیری می کند و دیگران را از دست می دهد
کله
بازپرداخت خود را بیان می کند: همیشه خود حاکم ، برنده یا خود است. تا زمانی که بتوانید بلند شوید
در اینجا در هیئت مدیره ، من به شما قول نمی دهم. ساختار بازپرداخت ، آنچه بازپرداخت را در آن نگه می دارد
مکان ، چیزی است که در آنجا در هیئت مدیره است. اولین موردی که برای شما هزینه دارد ، بیان خود شماست. دوم ،
هزینه هر خوشبختی در زندگی شماست. شما فقط از حق بودن خوشحال هستید. هزینه بعدی نشاط شماست
یا سلامتی شما و هزینه زندگی شما در زندگی شما توسط راکت شما امکان پذیر است
عشق ، از آفرینش. شما نمی توانید عشق ، تطبیق و درست بودن را در کنار هم قرار دهید. اگر هزینه بزرگتر شود
از بازپرداخت ، شما در یک لحظه آن را تسلیم خواهید کرد. به همین دلیل در یک تراژدی قهرمان خواهید شد: زیرا
هزینه درست در چهره شما است. فرشته خیلی سخاوتمند بوده است. او به شما کل داده است
مکانیسم اگر او نمی توانست در مورد درد درست باشد ، چه چیزی برای مقابله با زندگی خود باید باشد؟ Erhard به KIPP روی سکو پیوست. درز
فرشته ، درد باعث می شود طلاق ها درست باشند. شما طلاق گرفتید اشتباه بود و درد ایجاد می کند
درست است شما درد دارید تا خود را درست کنید. این بازپرداخت است آنچه از شما می خواهم ببینید
این است که درد در آنجا نیست زیرا شما طلاق گرفتید. درد وجود دارد تا شما را از بودن باز دارد
در مورد طلاق اشتباه است. اینگونه کار می کند ، اینطور نیست؟ فرشته
بله درز
هرگز مهم نیست که چرا آنجاست. آن را برای لحظه ای فراموش کنید. دیدن آن خیلی سخت است. اگر درد نبود
در آنجا خیلی اشتباه خواهید کرد؟ شما هیچ کس کم عمق نخواهید بود
ساختارهای رویی برای اصلاح مشکل - همدلی و "رفاه
کار "دو نفر هستند که هایدگر از آن یاد می کند. اما او همچنین به این نکته اشاره می کند
این راه حل های ontic هرگز نمی توانند یا به اندازه کافی جایگزین شوند
با این وجود ، از آنجا که آنها از موضوع اساسی هستی شناختی غافل می شوند:
کمبودهای موجود در حالتهای غالب بودن. اما حلالیت نیز یک حالت مثبت دارد که هایدگر
حلالیت شدید را صدا می کند. این حالت دو شکل دارد. روی یکی
دست ، داسین می تواند برای دیگری جهش کند:
این نوع حلالیت برای دیگری به دست می گیرد
آنچه او با خود نگران است. در
بدین ترتیب دیگر از موقعیت خودش بیرون رانده می شود. بشر بشر بشر در چنین حلالیت دیگری می تواند یکی شود
چه کسی مسلط و وابسته است ، حتی اگر این
سلطه یک ضمنی است و پنهان است
از او این نوع حلالیت ، که می پرید
در و از بین می رود "مراقبت" ، تا حد زیادی است
تعیین کننده برای بودن با یکدیگر. بشر بشر بشر (BT 158)
"
در شرایط عادی ، ممکن است یک شرکت کننده در انجمن انتظار داشته باشد
این نوع پاسخ دلسوزانه را به شرایط او دریافت کنید ،
مانند موضوعات زناشویی که توسط این شرکت کننده توصیف می شود. اما
حلالیت Erhard در این بخش از فرم دوم است:
[این] نوعی حلالیت است که چنین نمی شود
آنقدر جهش برای دیگری به عنوان جهش جلوتر
او بشر بشر نه به منظور از بین بردن "مراقبت" او بلکه
به جای اینکه آن را به طور واقعی به او بازگرداند
برای اولین بار این نوع حلالیت
اساساً مربوط به مراقبت های معتبر است - یعنی ،
به وجود دیگری ، نه به "چه"
که با او نگران است ؛ این به دیگری کمک می کند
تا در مراقبت از خود شفاف شود
و برای آن آزاد شوید. (BT 158-159)
"
ما در تمایز هایدگر در اینجا از حلالیت شدید می یابیم
جهش جلوتر از دیگری توصیف عمیق نقش

به معنای هر چیزی ، شما نیستید؟ بله بنابراین شما به درد نیاز دارید تا شما را از اشتباه بودن باز دارد. در
حداقل به این ترتیب کار نمی کند؟ (او گره می زند)
خوب ، این تنها چیزی است که من می خواهم شما را برای لحظه ای ببینید. من می خواهم شما ببینید که چقدر گودال مهم است
خوب به نظر می رسد اکنون ما خیلی خوب به نظر می رسیم که به شدت کمرنگ تر به نظر می رسد. خوب به نظر می رسد
با حق بودن تشکیل شده است. یا داشتن چیزی که با آن مشخص می کنید. و داشتن دیگری
مردم و چیزهای دیگر اشتباه است. فرشته به شما می گفت افرادی که به راحتی طلاق می گیرند و
هیچ دردی اشتباه نیست. من می خواهم شما ببینید که این بسیار مهم است که شما مایل به آن هستید
درد کافی در مدت زمان طولانی: درد شدید در مدت زمان طولانی که شما را از بین می برد
خوشبختی درست بودن آنقدر مهم است ، آنقدر مقدس ، که حتی درد زیادی در مدت زمان طولانی وجود ندارد
بیش از حد قیمت برای پرداخت درست است. من می خواهم شما ببینید که این چیزی نیست که رخ دهد
به طور عادی به شما هرگز در یک میلیون سال برای فرشته اتفاق نمی افتد که این درد باعث شده است
درست است ، زیرا این ساختار تفسیر نیست که ما در آن زندگی می کنیم. من و شما داریم
ساختار جدیدی از تفسیر را برای زندگی اختراع کرد: راکت. طلاق گرفتن تولید نمی کند
درد مرگ فرزندتان درد نمی کند. راکت ها درد ایجاد می کنند. چه اتفاقی نمی افتد
درد ایجاد می کند. اگر فرزند خود را از دست بدهید و ناراحت هستید ، این ضرر را بهبود می بخشد ، و این یک راکت نیست. غم و اندوه معتبر ضرر را بهبود می بخشد ، سپس از دست دادن کاهش می یابد ، سپس غم و اندوه ، و از این رو است
کامل اما نه در یک راکت: جایی که زندگی در مورد غم و اندوه بودن می شود. دیدن این بسیار سخت است ، و
به همین دلیل شما باید این امکان را با قدرت تشخیص دهید تا آنچه که یک اپرا صابون بود ، a
درام ، که بسیار واقعی و معتبر است ، می تواند برای آنچه در آن است ، یعنی یک راکت. این نمی رود
برای انجام آسان برای شما ، بنابراین باید با متمایز گوش دهید. (نشان دهنده فرشته)
من و شما در معرض دید قرار نمی گیریم. بعد از استراحت KIPP سهام زوج را تنظیم کرد. سرپرست انجمن از آغاز استراحت در ساعت 3:50 بعد از ظهر خبر داد. erhard (ادامه)

جلسه دو فاصله
فراموشی بودن بودن ، بخشی از هشت: گرفتن و از دست دادن
در نوامبر 2013 ، در حالی که این کتاب در حال توسعه بود ، ما یک ارائه ارائه دادیم-
در مورد آن به عنوان اعضای یک هیئت در انجمن ارتباطات ملی
کنفرانس در واشنگتن دی سی. پایان نامه ما این بود که گفتمان هستی شناختی
Forum دسترسی مستقیم به تجربه هستی را در اختیار شرکت کنندگان قرار می دهد. متعاقب
ارائه ، یک عضو مخاطب این سؤال را پرسید: شرکت کنندگان در عقب
تجربه این که این انجمن در دسترس قرار می گیرد ، چه چیزی می شود.
از آن تجربه؟ آیا ادامه دارد؟ این بدیهی است که یک سوال اصلی برای هرگونه بررسی کار Erhard است. از آغاز آن به عنوان آموزش EST ، کیفیت مداوم گریزان وجود داشته است-
حرف
ness ، و بنابراین رمز و راز ،
y در مورد تحولی که این کار در دسترس قرار می دهد. مردم با به دست آوردن نوع درک شناختی ، این انجمن را ترک نمی کنند
ما به طور کلی از یک فرایند آموزشی انتظار داریم. در عوض ، نتیجه این است که
شرکت کنندگان در گفتگو که در انجمن اتفاق می افتد ، "آن را بدست آورده اند"
تا حدودی به روشی که شخص شوخی می کند. هایدگر چنین فنوم را توصیف می کند-
بدون تجربه با زبان ، به این معنی است که زبان "رخ می دهد
ما ، به ما اعتصاب می کند ، بر ما می آید ، ما را تحت الشعاع قرار می دهد و ما را دگرگون می کند "(" NL "در OWL 57). این روند خطی نیست ؛ Erhard آن را به عنوان مدت طولانی توصیف نکرده است
زمان ، و سپس همه آن را یکباره می گیرید. اما در عین حال یک تشخیص وجود دارد که
آنچه ناگهان می بینید حقیقت است که قبلاً همیشه در بعضی از موارد شناخته شده اید. هایدگر آن را به عنوان "جهش" بر روی زمین که در حال حاضر هستیم توصیف کرد
ایستاده (WCT 233) ، و Erhard آن را با اصطلاحات مشابه توصیف کرده است: "من نمی توانم آن را داشته باشم
حرف
و آن را به شما بدهید. اما من می توانم به گونه ای ارتباط برقرار کنم تا شما فرصتی پیدا کنید
درک کنید که خودتان آن را قبلاً دارید. در اصل ، این همان چیزی است که آموزش EST [و
حرف
بعداً تالار گفتمان] برای انجام این کار ساخته شد. »(بارتلی 169). Y
کلمه آلمانی هایدگر برای این نوع تجربه Augenblick است. معمول
ترجمه فوری ، لحظه ای یا تقسیم دوم است. اما هوبرت دریفوس می گوید که در هاید-
استفاده از gger ، این کلمه مناسب تر به عنوان لحظه دید یا ترانس
mation (bt ، note 376 ؛ dreyfus ،
حرف
بودن در جهان 321). در
د
بودن و زمان ، هایدگر
از این کلمه برای تعیین سوئیچ ژستالت که هنگام استفاده یک انسان رخ می دهد استفاده می کند
مالکیت قاطع زندگی او و یک وجود معتبر امکان پذیر می شود (BT 387). حرف
از آنجا که تجربه انجمن به روش معمول درک نشده است ،
آیا در حافظه به روشی که درک شناختی است ، حفظ می شود. بودن می تواند باشد
ابلاغ شده ، و نتایج گزارش شده توسط شرکت کنندگان در انجمن شواهدی ارائه می دهد
ارتباط آن به عنوان تحول آمیز تجربه می شود. اما یک کیفیت اولویت بندی
به روشی که تجربه تحول آمیز حفظ می شود ، ادامه می یابد. علاوه بر این ،
Erhard ، انتظار می رود که از این امر خارج شود. "این راهی است که قرار است اتفاق بیفتد ،"
او به شرکت کنندگان در انجمن می گوید. "گرفتن و از دست دادن".
چرا اظهارات؟ چه چیزی در مورد بودن است که باعث عقب نشینی آن می شود -
بیش از دو هزاره از تجربه انسانی وجود خارج شده است. و به عنوان
این بارها در طول گفتگوی انجمن به عنوان Erhard و شرکت کنندگان عقب نشینی می کند
تلاش برای حضور آن؟ هایدگر در یک سری سخنرانی ها به این سؤال پاسخی داده است
در سال 1935 در دانشگاه فرایبورگ تحویل داده شد. در سال 1959 تحت عنوان AN منتشر شد
مقدمه ای برای متافیزیک ، این سخنرانی ها به اولین کار طولانی کتاب او تبدیل شد
ترجمه به انگلیسی. او بعداً در چهار مقاله تفکر خود را در مورد این موضوع گسترش داد ،
منتشر شده در سال 1975 به عنوان تفکر اولیه یونانی. در این حجم ها ، هایدگر پیدا می کند
منبع عقب نشینی موجود در نقطه اول ظهور آن. او این جونک را صدا می کند-
آغاز تاریخ - لحظه ای که اولین فیلسوفان غرب بودند
شروع به فکر کردن در مورد ماهیت هستی و درک خود به عنوان
سازندگان جهان. اما در حساب هایدگر ، تفکر غربی ، در آغاز ، نتوانست
حقیقت بودن در زبان را ضبط کنید. در نتیجه ، هستی و چه چیزی
تجربه ممکن است در دسترس باشد ، برای ما گم شده است ، و به این ترتیب حتی
مفهوم سازی آن مخالف تفکر ما است. هایدگر چه چیزی را ممکن می بیند
اگر دسترسی انسان به هستی احیا شد؟ او می گوید که ما به
Epiphany of A World (IM 69) - درک و تجربیات روزمره ما رخ می دهد
به تازگی ، در زمینه امکان که در دیدگاه فعلی ما در مورد چیزها وجود ندارد. به گفته وی ، این زمینه امکان در یک مختصر در دسترس انسان بود
لحظه تاریخ. چه چیزی از وجود شد؟ در این سریال در مورد فراموشی بودن ،
در طی فواصل بین جلسات ، حساب هایدگر را ارائه خواهیم داد. 138
