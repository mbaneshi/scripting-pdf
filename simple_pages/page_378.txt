SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (continuing; participants raising hands)
You’re scum, I know that. 
(laughter)
We told you not to do that and you did it right away, and if you haven’t yet, you will. Sleazy.
SALLY
I’ve also found myself wanting to do the same thing with them. It’s only bad if you make it 
mean something bad.
ERHARD
No, it’s bad because it’s bad. But you have to understand whence bad arises, or bad disempow-
ers you. You can’t avoid bad. Bad’s there. Like I said, go out and do something illegal, and you’ll 
fi nd out about what bad is.
SALLY
So what if I don’t think something’s bad but my dad does?
ERHARD
Who pays the food bills in your house?
SALLY  (laughing)
He does. So it doesn’t matter if I think something’s bad or not. 
ERHARD
Sure it matters if you think it’s bad. But look, what you’ve got is not the same kind of authority 
that your father has because you don’t pay the bills. So if you’re going to deal with the way you 
see things and the way he sees things, you’re going to have to deal with it in a diff erent method 
than he does. He deals with it like he pays the bills. You can’t deal with it like that, because you 
don’t pay the bills. You’ve got to fi nd another way to deal with it. Did you hear what I said?
SALLY
I think so. What I do costs him money, so...
ERHARD
No, what I mean is, he’s got authority. You don’t have authority. You’re not the boss in his 
house, he is, right? 
SALLY
Yeah.
