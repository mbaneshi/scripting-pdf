Forum Day Four: Session Two

KIPP
Right. That’s accurate terminology. Wants are part of the structure of being a human being. The
truth is: You’ve got to make people wrong in order to be right.
DOREL
The fi rst night I left here I got lost, because I don’t live here.
KIPP
No, you got lost.
DOREL
I got lost.
KIPP
You hear the diff erence? You got lost. You just got lost.
DOREL
And I got so damn angry at my brother-in-law who was supposed to leave me with a map and
directions and everything, but he didn’t. He just called me the night before everything started.
KIPP
You were lost and angry. Before you were just lost. Now you got lost and angry. A stupid person,
right?
DOREL (laughing)
Right.
KIPP
You could have just been lost.
(laughter)r
Except you had to screw it up and put anger in there.
DOREL
That’s right. And in a way I enjoy that.
KIPP
It’s familiar. Kick the walls. Spit on the fl oor. Exactly.
DOREL
The following night I had to get mad at the parking lot attendant.
various relationships), and we ourselves (and our properties and in
various relationships), along with the spatiality of here and there,
and the temporality of the past, the present, and the future.
The “ourselves” that shows up in the clearing that we are, is
that to which we refer when we say “I” or “me”—that is, our partic-
ular way of being in this or that moment, or our sense of ourselves
(our identity or persona).  You can confirm this by noticing that you
(as the clearing you are) are capable of being aware of yourself as
whatever it is that you are referring to when you say “I” or “me,”
and the at-the-moment way of being of that “I” or “me.”  In other
words, what you refer to when you say “I” or “me” shows up for
you in the clearing that you fundamentally and essentially are.
We note here that a drawback with the phrase the clearing
that we are is that it seems to imply subjectivity, and it is definitely
not meant in that way.  We will clarify and fully develop this during
t
the in-class sessions of the course.
Saying all this in other words:  Being for human beings (the
fundamental and essential nature of being for human beings)
is always and only, as philosopher Martin Heidegger so brilliantly
nailed it, “being in the world” (Being and Time). While we
generally think of being as something located “in here,” if you
take a careful look you will see that you are always being with
something or being about something, that is, always being in
t
the world (even if the part of the world you are being with is that
thing you refer to when you say “I” or “me” or the way of being
of “I” or “me”).
You can confirm for yourself that being for you is being in the
world, that you are so to speak a clearing for it all, in that when you
are conscious, you are always conscious of something or conscious
about something (even if what you are conscious of in a given mo-
ment is being conscious).  In other words, for human beings what
it is to be is for the world, all of it (our entire “state of the world”) to
show up (to occur).
Our moment to moment way of being is not the fundamental
t
and essential nature of being for us human beings.  When we are
being the clearing for life to show up, and our “I” or “me” self is

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
Yeah. He was there.
(laughter)r
Right. What the hell is he there for? That’s his job.
DOREL
The following night, I didn’t get angry. So what if it takes fi fteen minutes to let one car go.
KIPP
Right. If it takes fi fteen minutes, then it takes fi fteen minutes. And that’s the whole story. Get
your car. Life is hard. And then you die. They throw dirt over your face, and that happens
whether you get your car or not, whether you get it in two or fi fteen minutes.
DOREL (smiling)
I am just a goddamned bitcher and complainer in life. I get upset and angry and I bitch and
bitch and bitch and bitch.
KIPP
That’s right.
DOREL
So that’s the thing with me.
KIPP
Yeah. It’s interesting. You’re so honest in your speaking, it contributes to everybody in the room
a lot, Dorel. Your authenticity is powerfully contributing. It’s real. Makes a big diff erence for
people. I was leading The Forum in London, and during the evening session after the four days,
a man stood and shared that his younger son came to him: “Daddy Daddy, Johnny hit me.” “Uh
huh.” “But Daddy, you don’t understand, he hit me in the same place as before, where it really
hurt!” “Uh huh.” “But Daddy, Johnny’s older and you said before he should know better not
to hit me.” “Uh huh.” “Daddy, I don’t want you to go back to that seminar anymore because it
makes you stupid!”
(laughter)r
DOREL (laughing)
Am I going to be stupid?
KIPP
Yes. What’s going to be stupid is: It’s going to take fi fteen minutes to get your car when it takes
fi fteen minutes. And when you’re lost, you’ll be lost. And that’s life, yes? You don’t have to add
simply one of the things that shows up in the clearing, that leaves
us free to be and free to act in life—free to be and free to act with
whatever we are dealing with in any situation.   This is critical for
being a leader and exercising leadership eff ectively as one’s natu-
ral self-expression; and during the in-class sessions of the course
access to this fundamental and essential nature of being for us
human beings will be made available to you.
As was the case with the previous section (Section 2), during
the course everything in this section will be gone over and made
clear for you so that you can confirm its validity for yourself in
your own lived experience.  In addition, the critical importance of
what has been covered in this section for being a leader and the
eff ective exercise of leadership as your natural self-expression will
be dealt with in depth during the in-class sessions of the course. ■
