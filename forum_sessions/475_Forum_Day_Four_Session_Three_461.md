Forum Day Four: Session Three 461
that.’” And if it’s appropriate you communicate that, and that has the thing moving. And the
other thing I saw about problems is, just like you said, it’s stuck, it’s not moving, and when the
conversation is out here, it’s moving then, and it begins to work its way through whatever’s
stuck.
KIPP (to the group)
What you want to notice here is that even if you don’t quite understand what he is saying, you
can be with him distinguishing something. What’s enlivening is this business of learning and
growing. That’s what’s attractive to you, it’s his life that he’s inquiring into here. The guy’s so
turned on he can barely stand it.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 12)
That’s the last thing I want to say. I’ve been doing this for a long time...
KIPP
That’s why this Forum is special. You’ve got the old timers in this room. You fi nd out what it’s
like to live this stuff  for seventeen years. Doesn’t get less. Not like something you did seventeen
years ago.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 12)
I remember when I read Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind. The biggest pitfall is that you think
you know Zen, is that you “got it.” There was a part of this Forum when I was listening,
“yeah I got that.” And then there was another moment when I saw that I’d had the
conversation fifty times and a lot of people have gotten value out of that, but my life sucks
in that area. I’m so good at working with all these people making a difference, but what
about me and problems?
KIPP
That’s the diff erence between leading The Forum and being The Forum.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 12)
Exactly. And all of a sudden, at that moment, I got all excited about The Forum and the work,
and participating in it again, and learning, and growing and it was all brand-new for me.
KIPP
Thank you.
(applause)
It’s going to take everything you’ve got to be unreasonable with yourself to keep it opened up.
WANDA (whose mother is also a participant in The Forum)
I completed my relationship with my mother, I’m thrilled to say, and I actually didn’t think
that I needed to. But then yesterday when someone was sharing, I just started to cry a lot, and I
didn’t know what she had just said that made me cry.

SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
She said what she said. You cried. She did not make you cry.
WANDA
All right. What I did notice was I didn’t want her to see me crying. What I saw was two things
my mother said to me as a little girl that had been driving my life. She said that the way to make
her happy was that she’d be happy if I was happy.
KIPP
A lot of you withhold that from your parents. A lot of you don’t want to be well, alive, happy:
You’ve got to keep being a little bit screwed up so that they’re not quite sure they did it all right.
WANDA
The second thing she said about how to make her happy was that whatever I did was that I
would do my best, be the best that I could be. I saw early on that I could not deliver on the fi rst
point, I couldn’t make her happy by me being happy because growing up, my mother was beat
up a lot and I was miserable in that situation. I was telling her this whole thing over dinner
and she didn’t want to hear that part. It was too painful. It brought up that I wasn’t supposed
to share all of the sadness that I had. I was only allowed to share the good things. So I made
that decision that I couldn’t deliver on that promise. I did deliver on the arrangement that I
would be the best I could be at what I chose to be. I went on to gather a lot of credentials and
accomplishments, so that my mother would be happy. I told her that I have been living her
life for her because she also told me when I was little that she had her artwork as a teenager
featured in the Brussels World Fair and I said “Why didn’t you pursue that?” She said, “I went
to career day and went into the room for commercial artists and it was all men.” And the man
leading the event said to her that she had the wrong room. “The typing room is down the hall.”
KIPP
You all got sucked into that one. That’s how much strength you’ve got. One little thing and you
go...
(to laughter, Kipp imitates again a runt trying to break into the litter to feed from)
WANDA
When she had shared that with me, that she didn’t get to pursue her career I made a decision
that I would for her. I’ve been living her life for her. I would carry that torch...
KIPP
It’s not a torch; it’s an anvil around your neck.
WANDA (to laughter)
Right. Right. And then I asked her why she didn’t pursue it later and she said, “Well, I got
married and had sixteen children.”
