Forum Day Two: Session Three 
139
JODIE
Cheated. 
KIPP
That was on the court. You could hear that. Who has to pay for your not having a relationship?
JODIE
Everyone in my life.
KIPP
If you’re not cheated, you don’t know who to be in life. Maybe there is no being authentic.
Maybe the best there is, is being authentic about your own inauthenticity. Being related is much 
more risky than being unrelated. You’ve got to be there in the presence of being human. 
JODIE
I got it.
KIPP
Don’t be so quick to get it. See, I don’t think you got it. I don’t think you got the dagger in your 
heart. What’s your racket an excuse for? You don’t have to reveal yourself. You don’t have to
create a relationship. What persistent condition do you complain about? A cheated person has 
to look like a cheated person. You can’t have love in your life or you’d be wrong. What today’s 
about is beginning to be in the presence of your own life.
JODIE
I want to get beyond this. 
KIPP
There is no getting beyond it. That’s more California. The opportunity is to be with it. Maybe
there is no getting beyond your racket. Maybe the only dignity is in owning it.
The participant, Mike, who earlier in the day had interacted with Erhard about “knowing how to
walk,” raised his hand.
MIKE
I don’t know what my racket is. I’m lost.
(laughter)r
KIPP
What case are you pleading?
