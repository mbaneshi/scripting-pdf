Forum Day Three: Session Three 255
got that because I wrote my letter yesterday before I went to bed. And I didn’t have to wake up 
to get there. If someone asked me what I would give up, if I snored, I could give up the idea if I 
could stop myself from snoring.
KIPP
You only snore if you snore.
RICHARD
Well, there’s more to the story. I only snore in hotels.
KIPP
Got it.
RICHARD
I learned to snore in hotels. I lived in them for a year and a half.
KIPP
Clear.
ERHARD
What there is to get out of Richard’s share is that life is made up of trying to be. It’s made up of 
trying not to be, and of trying to be. Is there any being in trying not to be or trying to be?

MOLLY (in tears)
I came to The Forum on a mission from God to save WE & A. It’s actually not a joke. I mean: it 
is a joke on me... What I found out is that my racket is being abandoned. And I found out that I 
play my racket with God. 
ERHARD
I don’t talk about God a lot, because I don’t have a license to talk about God. You didn’t pay me 
to talk about God, so if somebody brings it up, I do what I can to avoid it, and if I can’t avoid 
it, I say as little as I can. I don’t like talking to you about God because God’s a racket for you 
and that’s disgusting. You need to listen to what Molly is saying because she knows both sides 
of the coin...now. So we’re not going to have a lot of discussions about this. We’ll have this 
discussion with Molly for everybody else. Go on.
MOLLY
I told my husband that when I was meditating that God told me to take The Forum, and he 
said, “so how are you going to get in this time, ’cause they rejected you last time.” I said I 
would play it their way. On the form I wrote what was so, but not the real so. It was the “how 
to get in” so.
