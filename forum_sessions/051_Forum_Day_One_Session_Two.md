Forum Day One: Session Two

MAX
The story is that I joined the service, and went to Vietnam. And my welcome home isn’t what
I expected. What happened was, I went to war and came back alive. Same as any other war,
there’s...it’s cleared up a lot of issues to look at it as what happened rather than my story in
relation to my coming home.
ERHARD (with emphasis)
Listen up! Vietnam’s a great, great story. Lot of people badly, badly fucked up by the story. Notice
I didn’t say by what happened? Lots of people profoundly disabled by the story. Lot of freedom
for people to start to distinguish the story from what happened. Thanks Max.
Erhard shifted his tone, calling attention to the process they had been engaged in: they had devel-
oped a number of distinctions as tools for their inquiry.
ERHARD
We’re going to get these tools sharpened up as we proceed. Your questions are useful. You notice
I’ve done most of what I’ve done out of people’s speaking. This is not a lecture, that’s why we
call it The Forum. This is a dialogue. My job is to manage the dialogue, not to lecture. I have
no pipeline to the truth. No one is asking you to believe anything that is said in here. But I’m
asking you to think about it. That’s diff erent from “reject” or “accept” it. Instead, see what the
world looks like standing in that idea. It doesn’t matter whether you agree or not. To tell the
truth, I’m not that impressed with you yet, to care whether you agree or not. I do want to hear
what you have to say. I’m not interested in your agreement or approval, or endorsement. I am
interested in you looking at what we’re saying here, to think about it yourself. And the way I’d
like you to do that is to not judge it or evaluate it to see if it fi ts with what you already think. If
I say anything that fi ts with what you already think, you shouldn’t be here. You can forget all
that. Anything I say that fi ts with what you already think: that’s not The Forum. Only what I
say that doesn’t fi t with the stuff  you think, that provokes you to think and see things in a new
way: that’s what’s valuable. But this isn’t the truth either. I don’t know about the truth. I know
how to talk so that people have new possibility in their life. If you talk with me, you can bet that
you’ll walk away with a new possibility in your life.
Now he introduced a new way to address what has already been the subject of the discussion.
ERHARD (continuing)
We’re going to talk about existence. That’s what we’ve been talking about. It’s hard to talk about.
It’s hard to pick yourself up by your own bootstraps. It’s got to exist to talk about it. If you’re go-
ing to question existence—talk about existence—it’s got to exist to talk about it. The word for a
concern for existence is ontology. And the reason I bring up that fancy sounding word is I want
you to know The Forum is not psychological. Most people can’t tell the diff erence. Psychology
is pervasive in our culture. The structure for interpretation for most people in this culture is psy-
chological. We’re all amateur psychologists. You see everything through a psychological lens.
untransformed audience whom one intends, through one’s rhetorical
transactions, to transform. Johnstone stated the problem this way:
Heidegger’s entire position is specifically
committed to the task of awakening phi-
listines from their ontological slumber
. . . . Das Man [the “they,” the philistine, the
untransformed] expects to be told in plain En-
glish what he can in fact come to understand
only by being awakened. But because Heide-
gger’s entire thrust is toward the awakening
of das Man he cannot reject as a mere philis-
tine the man who fails to understand him. In
Heidegger’s own terms, he is not successful
until he has reached the philistine. Hence in
a sense there are no philistines at all for him.
(“Rhetoric” 68)
“
How does one awaken people from a debilitating slumber if
they resist the process which is necessary for their awakening?
This question, as we will show, is a central one for the rhetorical
process of The Forum. ■

Only what I say that doesn’t fit with stuff
you think, that provokes you to think and
see things in a new way: that’s what’s
valuable.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (pausing to wake a participant who was nodding off )
It’s okay to sleep in here if you can do it bolt upright with your eyes open.
(returning to his topic)
Ontology is the diff erence between knowing how to play tennis and being a tennis player. They
don’t teach this in school for the most part, and when they do, they do it badly for the most part.
An ontological approach—that is to say, a concern-for-being approach—has got a lot of room in
it because it’s something we haven’t engaged in very much. The point is, there’s a lot of room
in a new realm. The psychological approach is one we’ve pushed really hard. And I want to be
clear I’m not denigrating it. And that’s not our approach.
(moving to one of the blackboards)
So far, we’ve distinguished two realms of existence. A phenomenon can exist in the realm of
story and it can exist in the realm of what happened.
Erhard drew two circles on the board: in the left circle he wrote the word  “Story,” and in the right he
wrote “What Happened.”
ERHARD (indicating the left circle)
Max gave us a good example. There’s the story of Vietnam and that’s here. And there’s what
happened, and that’s here.
(indicating the right circle in which he wrote “what happened”)
We’re going to see what happens when you begin to distinguish these two. You’re going to see
the impact it has on your ability and state of being to distinguish Vietnam “the story” and Viet-
nam “the what happened.” You can apply the demonstration anywhere. We need to talk about
thinking. Listen up. This is hard. Human beings have the notion that they think. Or—I might
as well introduce this—they are that they think. They be like they’re thinking. And there is
something happening. You and I call that “I think.” Here’s an exercise to tell if you’re thinking.
I’m going to shut up and you’re going to stop thinking.
(pausing for about fi fteen seconds)
You didn’t make it, did you? Nobody ever does, because it’s not you thinking. If you were
thinking then you could stop thinking. It is thinking, and you are having the thoughts it thinks.
t
Which is true? The old way of saying it or the way I said it? That’s not the point. I told you,
I don’t know the truth. I’m saying there’s something empowering about this, in the recogni-
tion that you don’t think. Like: “Hmm. I’m not thinking. It’s thinking, and I’m having those
thoughts.” What comes up when you think this way is the possibility of actually thinking.
Thinking is a process independent of those thoughts. Thinking is something like sitting with,
or more precisely something like dwelling in. It’s not like fi guring it out. You see, I asked you to
g
dwell in the possibility that it’s not you thinking.
(pausing again to address a number of people in the room who were getting sleepy)
It always happens about now. Thinking about thinking puts you to sleep. Thinking wakes you
g
up. Thinking is when you have to break your mind—though not all of that is thinking. Some of
it is bullshit.
“
It is thinking, and you are having the thoughts
t
it thinks. . . . Thinking is something like
sitting with, or more precisely something like
dwelling in. It’s not like figuring it out.
