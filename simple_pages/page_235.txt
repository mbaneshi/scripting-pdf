Forum Day Three: Session Three 221
ERHARD
You don’t want my job: I’m a throwaway. You turn God into another racket, another way to 
be right and make others wrong, another way to avoid the domination of the responsibility to 
be human. They’re going to put your ass in a hole in the ground and throw dirt in your face 
and that’s the end of that story. Don’t turn that into more bullshit. And don’t do it because 
everybody else does. Tony, you kind of got there early. And it’s important to go through all the 
parts of the conversation. We’re going to do that. Stick around. Thanks
TONY
Thank you.

When I did the last session, I immediately felt ripped off , because my girlfriend took this last 
month. I already knew what was going to happen through the whole thing, and I...
ERHARD
Didn’t make that much of a diff erence, though, knowing what was going to happen, did it? 
BETH
Right. And it’s because I didn’t stop myself and a lot of times I stop myself. And so I thought, 
“okay, I’m going to do it,” and so I closed my eyes, and I was... stuck. And I thought: “Okay, I 
want to get out of this” because I was thinking that this person was supposed to kill me and 
the person next to me was going to kill me and that was too far removed from me. And so I 
said okay, what other kind of fear do I have? And that kind of fear was the fear of intimacy. 
(crying)
And that...
ERHARD
Slow down. Slow down. Go ahead.
BETH
That made me sad. But I felt good about being sad, because I was doing the process and I didn’t 
stop myself and I still have the fear of intimacy. And I stop myself a lot of times by not taking 
risks. 
ERHARD
And you made a soap opera out of it.
(to the group)
And you stopped yourself a lot of times and you don’t take risks and that’s sad and you tried 
and you struggled and then you gave up and fi gured the hell with it, and tried to be something
