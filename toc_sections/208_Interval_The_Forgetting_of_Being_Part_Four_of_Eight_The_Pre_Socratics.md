SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (rejoining the conversation)
“I’m confused” is a racket; always only a racket. It’s a way of being from which you can survive
when you’re threatened. “I know that I don’t know” is an opening for enlightenment. Nothing
shows up in confusion. Confusion is a resistance to knowing, and it’s built on a resistance to not
knowing. Your resistance to not knowing produces this racket called being confused. Lots of the
time when I’m reading I have to read something over again because I don’t get it. But I’m not
confused. If I’m confused I put the book down and walk away. Not knowing is a very high state
of knowing. It’s the step next to knowing. But confusion is way down at the bottom. The state
before natural knowing is knowing that you don’t know. Confusion is a defense mechanism, not
an attempt to learn. It’s a defense mechanism against fear.

My sleepless nights disappeared the moment I signed up for The Forum.
WES
How many of you had something signifi cant happen out of enrolling?
(most people in the room raising their hands)
Why that happens: it was a commitment. Filling out the card, paying the money, created a
commitment. It’s a stand for something, which itself generates the results.
PARTICIPANT
What I’m in the presence of is the cost of trying to change my racket instead of having it.
WES
You always have a reason for everything. That’s what it is to be human. What displaces the
possibility of contributing or making a diff erence is identity.
PARTICIPANT
I was surprised that the person I chose to write the letter to was my mother—surprised that she
was the person who would understand—with all the stuff  I have going on.
WES
You notice her mother didn’t change. This shift in her relationship with her mother came
from a realization she had. When your racket is running your life, your life isn’t happening.
Something dead is happening, not living. When your racket is running your life, something is
thwarting life.
At this point Wes announced a break, and gave participants an assignment.
WES (continuing)
Two questions for the break: What is your fundamental point of view about life? What is the
fundamental point of view about life?
They adjourned for a break at 12:25.

the pre-Socratics because they survive only in fragments whose interpretation can
easily be skewed in a Heideggerian direction” (Polt 133).
But Gerald L. Bruns, in his study of Heidegger’s later writing, has suggested
that in his conversation with the ancient Greeks, Heidegger is musing on “a handful
of overtranslated words (physis, logos, moira, eris, aletheia, hen)” in order to
‘undertranslate’ these words, as if to preserve them in their darkness” (Heidegger’s
Estrangements 181). This means taking words in “a sense which is diff erent from
what is customary or established or used with reason; it is to take them in a sense
which is wandering or ambiguous in the manner of the word rather than fixed in the
manner of the term” (Heidegger’s Estrangements 181). Here we have wandered into
a traditional definition of rhetorical figures, both tropes and schemes, which serve
to turn us away from the common usage and meaning of sentences (schemes) and
words (tropes). Etymology is one such turning away from the current and common
to retrieve and make present what has been lost and dispersed; etymology is in
essence a form of punning that brings about a shift , an awakening to a sense distinct
from the obvious and everyday. Bruns writes that
“
Aft er all, an etymology is, rhetorically, a figure of speech that
consists of taking a familiar expression strangely, where the
strangeness takes the form of some repressed or forgotten
“original sense.” But of course there never was such a sense
in the sense of a time when etymology determined use. There
never was anything but idiom, that is, no time of pristine,
undisseminated (fixed) meaning. . . . To imagine a people
somewhere actually speaking etymologically is comic theatre
worthy of Jonathon Swift  or James Joyce—or Woody Allen.
(Gerald Bruns, Heidegger’s Estrangements 134–135)
While there is no “original” meaning of a word, the tendency to forget the constitutive
possibilities of language leaves us to assume there was a time of pristine and fixed
meaning from which we have devolved, and back to which the practice of etymology
might bring us. Thus, remembering our forgetfulness through etymological punning—if
we follow the movement of Heidegger’s figure—evokes the “strangeness” of what
appears to be an “original sense.”
John D. Caputo has proposed a similar justification for these etymologies:
Heidegger’s goal, says Caputo, is “to eff ect a ‘destruction,’ a shaking loose, of
Western philosophy in order to gain access to what is really being said in and by it.
The Forgetting of Being, Part Three of Eight: Heidegger's
Etymologies
Heidegger’s project may be seen as a reaction against the development of the
metaphysical tradition in Western thinking, and as a corresponding attempt to
think a way back to the greatness which was promised at the beginning of Western
philosophy. For Heidegger, a significant step in this thinking-back involves tracing
the etymologies of terms whose meanings emerged with the pre-Socratic Greek
thinkers, whose writings mostly exist as fragments. These meanings, and the path
of their development over the centuries, have critically influenced the way human
beings in Western cultures (and, increasingly, global cultures) experience their
world.
The meanings of these terms, Heidegger claims, took an unfortunate turn
early in their development, so that today, in our loss of an experience of Being, we
suff er the consequences of this devolution. Heidegger is forceful on this point: our
language, he says, is “worn out.” We must therefore “seek to win back intact the
naming force of language and words; for words and language are not just shells
into which things are packed for spoken and written intercourse. In the word, in
language, things first come to be and are” (IM 15).
In tracing this historical process, Heidegger has constructed what Richard
Polt describes as “a saga in which an original Greek experience of unconcealment
degenerated into a focus on correctness, with dire consequences for us all”
(Heidegger: An Introduction 133). Heidegger’s historical perspective on language,
and thus Being, is developed throughout his writing, and is therefore complex and
varying, especially aft er the “turn” in his later work. But, says Polt, what remains
constant is that the story of Being is a story of decline, “a fall from a promising Greek
beginning” (132).
In his attempt to restore the power of Being, therefore, Heidegger proposes
to explore the earliest extant written clues to our origins. In his development of
these etymologies, Heidegger’s readings of the Greek texts are controversial. John
Stewart, among others, has raised the question of whether these readings are in fact
supported by the texts themselves (“Speech and Human Being” 64); and Richard
Rorty has gone so far as to call Heidegger’s etymologies “largely fake” (Contingency,
Irony, and Solidarity 131). Polt characterizes them as “idiosyncratic,” and wonders
whether, in his selection of Greek texts to deconstruct, Heidegger is “so attracted to
Forum Day Three: Session One Interval
197
For Heidegger . . . the deepest meaning of a text is ‘concealed’ within it, for what a
text has to say is ‘unspoken’ in it.” This is why Heidegger’s interpretations appear
“outrageous” and “scandalous,” says Caputo: Heidegger hears a “primal address,”
“the power of the first word” (The Mystical Element in Heidegger’s Thought 170).
It is also useful, given the emphasis that Heidegger’s later thinking placed on
the generative nature of the language of poetry, to consider this passage from his
analysis of the Anaximander fragment, considered “the oldest fragment of Western
thinking”: “Thinking of Being is the original way of poetizing. . . . Because it poetizes
as it thinks, the translation which wishes to let the oldest fragment of thinking itself
speak necessarily appears violent” (EGT 19).
Thus Heidegger may be seen in his exploration of Greek thinking to be weaving
a linguistic and poetic tapestry, threaded throughout with ambiguity, but a tapestry
to which his entire thought is devoted: the language of Being, which is already
always in language. If language is “the house of Being,” the question of Being is
necessarily implicit in every question and yet at the same time always beyond
language: “Being remains unthought” (“LH” in BW 242).
His etymological discursions should therefore be considered in the same way
as his phenomenological proposals regarding Dasein’s existential components: we
should try them on, to consider whether, in the end, they allow us to see something
we had not heretofore seen. As Polt points out, Heidegger’s etymologies, while
idiosyncratic, nevertheless succeed in shedding a new light on the tradition:
“Translating logos as ‘reason’ may not be wrong, but it certainly does less to make us
think than does Heidegger’s rendition of it as ‘collecting collectedness’” (Heidegger:
An Introduction 135).

SPEAKING BEING
The Forum resumed at 12:55 pm. Wes was on the platform, and called for participants to share about
having called their parents or others in their lives to “get complete.”
PRESTON
I think I’ve had what’s called a breakthrough. I will try to contextualize it using the language I
am learning here.
WES
Why don’t you just share it?
PRESTON
I always feel better after a disclaimer. I was in New Jersey two weeks ago and Werner was there.
On the blackboard was written: “I am prepared to be the man I haven’t been, and I won’t be the
man I was.” And what came to me as I was settling up with my parents is that I chose to honor
the integrity of the process.
WES
What’s happening in The Forum could be called coaching. That’s the conversation The Forum
leaders are committed to. Very few people in life are coachable. Children are uncoachable.
Because every time you say anything to them they say, “I know.” And very few of us ever grow
out of that. Making oneself coachable is an act of generosity.
PRESTON
It was an act of trust. I got that as soon as the fl oor is raised by one of us, it aff ects all of us.
There’s a redundancy of overlap that makes for perfect survival. I felt the mechanism of the
fl oor. My racket is manipulation: When it comes to relationships with women, fi rst I fascinate,
then I entice sexually, and then I become emotionally unavailable. But I’m able to be with
that now. The boss racket I run is manipulation. The way I am in the world is manipulation.
And the way that it is, is that you can have anything in the world as long as it isn’t touched by
manipulation. The manipulation that I’ve crafted into a high art turns out to be the only thing
that can sabotage what really exists, which is, you can have it, just don’t tell a story, have it, go
about the steps to have it. I completed with my parents, who are both gone. I see that I’ve got
doubts to meet every situation, but I’ve also begun listening. I want to acknowledge you all for
the privilege.
WES
So you want to hear in people’s speaking: The Forum. That’s the whole Forum. So now he’s
going into the bonus land. He got the whole Forum. You don’t even have to remember what he
said. What you want to see is The Forum working in people’s speaking, and allow yourself to be
used by it. Joyce?
JOYCE
Yesterday, I was clear that I was complete with my father, who had passed away. Then I
looked at my mother, and saw that she is perfect the way she is, and that I was complete with

her. There was nothing else to do. But then I realized that there was something incomplete,
which was how I was in the relationship, but not how I presented myself in the relationship.
I saw what a shit I was when I was a teenager, and how much damage I had done by leaving.
I left home after college and I emigrated to this country alone. I made it on my own. I never
completed that I ran away.
WES
She’s talking about running away as a solution to a problem. Probably useful for you to look
at the things you have left, the people you have left in order to solve a problem. To get the
communication you left from their perspective.
JOYCE
Yesterday I saw the damage I had done. I see that I participate, but I don’t share. I’m very good
at what I do, but I don’t put myself in there. And I knew that I had to give that up here in The
Forum. I called my mother. I told her. She said “that’s great!” I told her about two incidents that
were very troubling. I told her that I got how rotten I was in the process of leaving. She said,
“yes you were.”
WES
And right there was the moment of getting off  it.
JOYCE
She said, “thank you for telling me that.” She described how I was and it was frightening. I can
see what it must have been like for her. I saw what I am like; I can see what a pain in the ass I
am for all the people I work with. I have heard it but haven’t really seen it. It was very settling.
WES
There’s a possibility for being in communication that settles issues.
JOYCE
She told me “hearing this gives me a wave of warmth.” I got that I set her free and that I was
too.
WES
Great. Thank you.
(applause)
I invite you to listen to big people, people willing to set aside their accomplishments, to not use
them as an excuse to not participate, as a way for you to put yourself into The Forum.
Jake stood—the participant from Day One who was “hustle waiting to happen” and who also was
“nutty” about inauthenticity.

SPEAKING BEING
JAKE
I was a shit to my mom when I was nine years old. Our relationship has been the same, and so I
apologized to her. I told her I was here and she thought that was neat. She was glad to hear that.
I said “let’s not be this anymore.” I told her that I accept her. She drives me nuts, but I want a
relationship with her.
WES
She doesn’t drive you nuts. You can have an interpretation that your mother drives you nuts.
I know that one very well. When I was thirty-fi ve I visited my mother in Miami and she told
me what time she thought I should be home. Drove me nuts. If it was raining out, she would
suggest clothes to wear. Drove me nuts: until I got off  it and got how much of a creep I was. I
got off  it and I allowed my mother to mother me. Because that’s what mothers do. That’s their
job. What did you expect your mother to do? Business deals with you?
JAKE
I’ve got a complex network of anxiety of reactionary being. When I’m that way it destroys what
we can’t have between each other. We don’t have a connection. I told her I loved her and she
said something to me. I realized she knew more of what’s going on than I thought. She said that
she would give me the space to be me. She knows how crazy she is. And she said she was going
to stop doing that with me.
WES (to another participant taking a microphone)
This is about completing with your parents?
ESME
My twin sister. I saw how I make her wrong. I told her that I loved her, that I had taken things
out on her instead of “you,” which I mean everyone.
WES
There’s a lot more love going on around you than most people are willing to experience.
ESME
I completed with my sister about our competition for our dead father’s love. But I still was
having an issue with “you” when I overheard a bunch of people asking a woman from Uganda
really stupid questions. I realized she wasn’t upset about stupid questions, and that I don’t have
to be. I can be an expert about being a twin.
WES
We’ve got to move on. But you have a standing invitation to keep getting complete with people
in your life. One of the commitments of The Forum is to unconceal the being of human
beings—what’s giving you who you are. What was there before you were born? If you’re a man
or a woman, you were born into what it is to be one. If you’re trying to carve out a new version,
you’re doing it against that already always background. The being of human being was decided
at a party you weren’t invited to and you had to fi t into that once you showed up. One of the
Danger: Attunements and Moods
In Heidegger’s account of human existence, Dasein—human
being—is always being some way. Being-in-the-world, that is, is
always a particular way of being. Heidegger uses two terms for
this condition—Befindlichkeit, which is translated as state-of-mind
(Dreyfus translates this as aff ectedness), and Bestimmung, translated
as attunement. Both terms will be found in passages quoted in this
book, but we will focus on the latter term, “attunement,” since it
avoids psychological implications embedded in “state-of-mind,”
and more powerfully suggests the totality of the situation: I am
always attuned to the world in some way, and my attunement at
any moment determines what things in the world mean to me—how
much and in what way they “matter.”
But my options for ways of being attuned to the world have
been made available to me in my thrownness—that is, they are
limited to a certain range of opportunities for understanding, a
context of meaning into which I have been thrown, willy-nilly,
and over which I have no control (see the “Thrownness” sidebar
in Session Three of Day Two). The nature and source of these
limits are invisible to me; like water to a fish, this background is
so enveloping, so constitutive of everything, that I cannot see it. I
simply experience its strictures in my life, and, occasionally, have
the vague sense that there might be something more. In another of
Erhard’s expressions, my thrownness lies in the realm of what we
don’t know that we don’t know, and is therefore beyond our grasp.
But it colors everything.
Further, there is something primordially threatening about the
nature of this context, a danger that leads us to avoid confronting
it (though we don’t know that this is what we are doing),
despite our sense that more might be possible in life. Dasein,
at some level, recognizes that it does not want to face up to the
inescapability of its limits—what Heidegger calls “the facticity of
its being delivered over” (BT 174). To avoid this confrontation, we
lose ourselves in the distractions of the they-self—averageness,
curiosity, ambiguity, and the chatter of the public realm. In certain
states of mind, a situation may occur for us with a heightened
intensity, but its nature remains obscured: an attunement is the
kind of Being in which
Forum Day Three: Session Two 201
commitments of The Forum is to unconceal the entire design of human being. Something very
powerful occurs, transformation occurs when you can actually be present to the design: human
being. What we want to confront, near the source of the design “human being,” is what is your
fundamental point of view and relationship to life? Life is really composed of other people.
What we’re really asking is, what’s the fundamental relationship to other people?
At this point, Wes called two participants to come to the chalkboards.
WES
We’re going to start with the question, what is the fundamental point of view of human beings
for life? Your fundamental point of view toward life occurs in a very simple statement. I’m not
interested in your complicated philosophies. Call out, “Life is —”
The group began calling out responses, and as they did so, the two participants at the boards wrote
the answers: hard, change, imperfect, me, a problem, survival, dangerous, fun, experiences, etc.
WES
When you’re being in life, what’s really there?
Various participants called out: “Imperfect. Hard. Quest for knowledge. Change. Problem. Me.
Evolvement. Survival. Dangerous. Not fair. Getting by. Threatening. Fun. Continual state of
learning...”
WES
A lot of this is bullshit—When you’re being in life. “Continual state of learning” is conceptual.
That’s not you walking down the street having to deal with the street. See, there’s you, and
there’s it... everything else. Isn’t that a fundamental division? There’s you and then there’s “it.” I
want to know your relationship to “it.” When you’re present to you and “it,” what’s there, like a
presence?
People continued to call out answers which were written on the board: I’ll show it, impressing
it, struggle, approval, hide from it, it’s fucked and I’ll never fi x it, separation, dealing with stupid
people, life can hurt you, etc.
WES (continuing)
Your relationship to “it” is struggle, and “it” is going to win. It will. You don’t live like that.
“It” is bigger. You’re going to die. Your life is about a relationship to “it,” to prevent dying, and
“it” is going to win. You don’t live like that. You know it. People forget how they originated.
You’re dealing with “it,” but in a way that you’re going to lose. The fundamental point of
view upon emerging into noise and cold and pain at birth: life is about avoiding the threat.
Life is dangerous. It’s threatening. Life is a threat. How do you respond? Survive. Life is about
surviving the threat that life is. That’s the already always way it is. That’s what you inherited.
That’s what you joined. You didn’t choose it. And you are it. Some of you are dealing with
danger by getting “its” approval. Some of you are dealing with danger by fl attering “it.” Some
Dasein constantly surrenders itself to the
‘world’ and lets the ‘world’ “matter” to it in
such a way that somehow Dasein evades its
very self. (
f
BT 178, emphasis added)
“
Attunements disclose thrownness in such a way as to conceal it;
thrownness is disclosed in the manner of an evasive turning-away
(BT 175). It’s there but we don’t want to look.
Closely related to an attunement is a mood, which may be
seen as the attunement’s affective dimension—the ontic
manifestation in human experience of an ontological condition
that remains in the background. We are never free of moods,
whether intense or pallid. But nothing like a mood could occur
for us, says Heidegger,
if Being-in-the-world, with its state-of-mind
[Befindlichkeit], had not already submitted
itself to having entities within-the-world “mat-
ter” to it in a way which its moods have outlined
in advance. (BT 177, emphasis added)
“
A mood arises from an attunement. So while we generally ascribe
the cause of a mood to the circumstances, Heidegger suggests that
we always already have a relationship with the world that evokes
our particular moods. Our unwillingness to confront this situation
leaves us stuck as the victim of the circumstances. It leaves us
going through the motions of a life that is not our own, and thus
we are immersed in an inauthentic existence.
But in certain attunements, Heidegger saw the possibility for
an authentic human experience of Being. Some moods, he saw,
have more significant potential for prompting such a disclosive
experience. The prerequisite is that the mood evoke a shift  of focus:
we must become present to the world, rather than to those specific
things in the world with which we are concerned.
Generally, in our everyday preoccupations, we seem to “cling
to this or that particular being.” But at some level, says Heidegger,
we are always dealing with beings as a whole. This does not mean
assuming a detached “objective” stance toward the populace; it is
rather an element of our attunements:

of you are dealing with danger by being smart. Some of you are dealing with danger by being
successful. Your racket is your way of dealing with the danger that life is. I want you to consider
the possibility that along with this fundamental point of view there is an experience of living,
which is almost never acknowledged by people. It’s totally suppressed, but it runs your life. It
runs your relationships with other people. Ask yourself, why do I have to have a racket? What’s
it covering over? What’s driving it?
LOTTIE
I’m so tough I don’t need anybody. I’m supposed to know and if I don’t know then I’m not
tough.
WES
What does that cover over?
LOTTIE
That I’m a woman.
WES
What’s the experience underneath that?
LOTTIE
That I’m a sexual being; that I’m not supposed to want it.
WES
Are you scared of sex?
LOTTIE (reluctantly)
Yes.
WES
You see, she couldn’t even say it. Couldn’t acknowledge it. And this is a woman who was really
trying to say it, but it was horrifying to even acknowledge that she’s scared of it—because she’s
tough. Tough people are never afraid.
LOTTIE
I just about died at the thought that it could be a part of my life.
WES
Got it. Great. Thanks.

Other participants shared their answers and as they did so Wes indicated the fear that underlay
each one: “I’m afraid I’ll get taken advantage of”; “I’m terrifi ed of being alone”; “I’m afraid of being
Why do such moods give a possibility of authentic self-disclosure?
Remember, we are questioning aft er the background, the
determinative context for the everyday. Heidegger calls it the nothing,
but it generally occurs for us as something, and we resist it. If we are
moved to seek it, however, where can we look? Heidegger’s response:
In the end an essential distinction prevails
between comprehending the whole of beings in
themselves and finding oneself in the midst of
beings as a whole. The former is impossible in
principle. The latter happens all the time in our
existence. (“WM” in BW 99, emphasis added)
“
If the nothing itself is to be questioned as we
have been questioning it, then it must be given
beforehand. We must be able to encounter it.
Where shall we seek the nothing? . . . The total-
ity of beings must be given in advance so as to
be able to fall prey straightway to negation—in
which the nothing itself would then be mani-
fest. (“WM” in BW 98, emphasis added)
“
But for the background to be disclosed, it must become the
foreground: our presence to the whole must occur as salient.
This shift may happen, for example, in the mood of boredom:
No matter how fragmented our everyday exis-
tence may appear to be, [. . .] it always deals with
beings in a unity of the “whole,” if only in a shad-
owy way. Even and precisely when we are not
actually busy with things or ourselves, this “as
a whole” overcomes us—for example in genuine
boredom. . . . Profound boredom, drift ing here
and there in the abysses of our existence, like a
muff ling fog, removes all things and human be-
ings and oneself along with them into a remark-
able indiff erence. This boredom reveals beings as
a whole. (“WM” in BW99)
“
It is the function of The Forum to make present the totality of beings
so that it can be cleared through negation.
WES (continuing)
