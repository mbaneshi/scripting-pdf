Forum Day Four: Session Three 517
BILL
For a great part of my life I’ve been doing things in-order-to. Very often in-order-to. I changed
jobs in-order-to; I got a college degree in-order-to. Everything I’ve done has been in-order-to.
I’ve been searching a lot to fi nd out how to be happy just being. And coming here is a... I want
to thank the people who compelled me to be here. Well, infl uenced me, empowered me...
ERHARD
People pressured you into being here. I understand. Go on.
(laughter)
BILL
They empowered me and they were very magnanimous in doing so. I recognize now that there’s
a lot of joy in just being.
ERHARD (to the group)
You want to hear that. You don’t want to listen to that like it’s some kind of platitude. Listen
to it like it’s a possibility into which to live your life. Joy in just being. That’s diff erent than
running your racket just being.
BILL
I came here with a lot of things on the line.
(holding back tears)
I had a brother who lived with me who was just killed in an automobile accident, and...
ERHARD
And that’s sad. Authentically so.
BILL
Yes.
ERHARD
Not racketedly so. Racketedly so it’s bullshit. Authentically it’s sad—to lose your brother.
BILL
But the way I was responding to it was I wanted to get out of my immediate environment and,
as I said, I’ve always been putting reasons and contingencies on every move in my life.
ERHARD
Hold on for a second. We’ve gotten a lot of people up here so you could see yourself. And a
lot of that was hard to see. Seeing some of the bullshit you are is hard to see. Now you got
a guy being the other end of the spectrum. A guy standing up being possibility. Start seeing
yourself there too. I don’t hear Bill giving a report. I hear Bill making a declaration. I hear

SPEAKING BEING
Bill standing for what he got out of his participation in The Forum. Bill’s making all this
up. There’s not one bit of it that’s not made up. Just like when the umpire says “strike”: It’s
a strike because he said so. It’s not a report on the man’s internal state. That’s not the way
I listen it. I listen him declaring himself, saying who he is in the matter of his participation
in The Forum.
BILL
I had called a friend that I had told I was moving to Germany. I had lived there previously and
was looking forward to it. My experience is not that I am going there because of anything: I get
now that I choose to go there.
ERHARD
Do you understand that’s just a way of speaking? But it’s not mere semantics as you would
call it. “I’m going there because I’ve chosen to go there.” It’s just a way of speaking. He could
say that he’s going there because he already made the commitment, or that it would be
inconvenient to get out of going there. Or I made the commitment when I wanted to get away
from being reminded that my brother died. Which one is empowering? Which one’s going to
give Bill the most power? The most freedom to be?
BILL
I’d like to in the future use this experience to make choices for myself and not blame them
on circumstances, and take complete responsibility for my life, and to experience the joy of
each day, every day of my life: to look forward to each day with a possibility; to not have my
happiness contingent upon anything I create or anything that I want in life. This is really giving
me the framework for, the context...
ERHARD
Because you said so. It is because he said so. When he stops saying so it won’t be. Brilliant, Bill.
Absolutely brilliant. Thank you for your generosity.
(applause)
(to the group)
The last step is the answer to the question, why can’t you say “I love you” to somebody? Because
you’re too sincere to do that. And you won’t say “I love you” to somebody unless you really feel
it, will you? I mean, that would be terrible, wouldn’t it? Saying “I love you” to people you didn’t
feel love for, that would be insincere, wouldn’t it? That’s true insincerity. Saying “I love you”
to people you don’t feel love for. That would be insincerity, right? That’s my proof for: You are
your feelings. You get that? I just proved to you that you are your feelings. See, what you say isn’t
insincere unless it’s an expression of your feelings. Which means you are that over which you’ve
got no dominion. That’s what you are... I’m accusing you of being your feelings. I’m accusing
you of being something over which you have nothing to say. I’m accusing you of being sincere,
which I fi nd disgusting, because that’s what sincere is, sincere is identifying with the way you
