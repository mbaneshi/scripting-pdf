Forum Day Three: Session Four

WES
Okay.
KEVIN
I always have to back it up, in every way I can, so that if they screw up I’ll have a way to get 
myself out of the situation.
WES (shifting back and forth)
Yeah. So you’re like this. One foot kinda in, one foot kinda out? In coaching, right?
KEVIN
Professionally I’ve been very eff ective. Been very successful. So why am I here, well because this 
doesn’t work in other aspects of my life.
WES
It may not even work in the area you think it does work.
KEVIN
Well I think there’s certain objective evidence there that...
WES
Oh, I know you’re successful and all that stuff , but you have no idea of what could have been 
possible.
KEVIN
Oh yeah, I agree, now, looking back, I can see what I could have done better, if I... 
WES
Yeah, not even taking into account who you could be in life. 
KEVIN
Right.
WES
Rather than just successful, but who you could be. 
(to the group)
Kevin’s sharing something powerful in telling one on himself. Remember: people resist being 
coached, so we’re not really open to other people’s contribution. And to the degree you do that 
you miss the contribution that’s available. Now you can start to see that. You’ll always come up 
with a story that justifi es it; there’s always a story that justifi es it: “I didn’t like this”; “they’re 
selling me this”; “they said that”; etc. That’s human being. 
KEVIN
Oh, I’ve got a lot of those stories.
