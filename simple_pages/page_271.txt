Forum Day Three: Session Three 257
MOLLY
And then we got to the deeper part of the story. My father told me how much I didn’t 
appreciate what he gave me, and my mother said that I abandoned them when I went to 
college...
ERHARD
Hold on, I want everyone to get this.
(loudly)
They’ve got a big fucking story too! They got their story. Can you imagine the story my 
mother’s got? My mother doesn’t have any story. She could have a story. So. You were noticing 
that they have a story.
MOLLY
I’ve been terrifi ed all my life of anger. And I would do anything I can to avoid anger. I do that 
with my husband. Standing on this ledge on the phone with them. The anger would pull me 
down to the valley. I would become comatose.
ERHARD
Right, you became comatose once to survive being with your parents.
MOLLY
I was comatose.
ERHARD
When you are that it’s empty and meaningless and it’s empty and meaningless that it’s empty 
and meaningless, and you can be with another’s story no matter what it is, you’re fearless. 
Without fear you don’t have need for courage.
MOLLY
My father’s anger didn’t frighten me for a change. I loved him. 
ERHARD
It’s not that you like or endorse his being angry. He’s angry, that’s all. And when you can be 
with his anger it disappears. When you got to try to do something to get him from being angry, 
or get him to stop being angry, or some other ploy, the anger persists no matter how good the 
ploy is. I know this because I talk to your kids. They forgive but they don’t forget, until you can 
be with whatever it is that they’re remembering. 
MOLLY
I didn’t have to prove anything.
ERHARD
Because it’s horseshit. What is this more or less love, to start with? “You either love me or you don’t”.
