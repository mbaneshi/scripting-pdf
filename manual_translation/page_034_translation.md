SPEAKING BEING
DORIS (stammering slightly) 
Are you inferring that I don’t . . .?
ERHARD
No.
(pausing) 
We don’t know yet. 
DORIS
I assure you I do. 
ERHARD
Really? We’ll see. You either do or you don’t, so there’s nothing to be nervous about. Then we 
could discuss ultimate being. 
(pausing)
I want you to get that I am not a guy in a diner.
He moved toward the back row where Doris was standing:
ERHARD (continuing) 
When I was growing up on the east coast, my family took trips to visit people. And we would 
drive home, oftentimes very late at night, oftentimes when it was raining or snowing or nasty. 
And diners, as far as I knew, were places where you stopped to get a cup of coff ee so you could
stay awake while you were driving. And at my age I couldn’t let anybody do anything without
my being there, so I always had to go in with them. And I learned about guys in diners. Guys in
diners, late at night like I’m describing to you, are usually fairly lonely, because they don’t have 
anybody to talk to. And they just love for somebody to stop in because then they’ve got some-
body to talk to. And you know, you go in, and you’re the only person there, and you sit up at the
counter, and you have your cup of coff ee and whatever else. And you fi nd out that this guy in 
the  diner—the guy behind the counter—knows everything about everything. There is nothing 
about which he does not know. He knows what the president ought to do about the defi cit, he 
knows what the country ought to do about international relationships, he knows what you 
ought to do about your marriage, he knows what kind of work you ought to do and how what-
ever kind of work you are doing how you could do it better, he knows something about every-
thing. Most people are like a guy in a diner. Goddamned near everybody knows everything 
about everything. So in here—at least in The Forum—I question everything. Everything—in-
cluding whether or not you know your ass from a hole in the ground. And whether anyone is
qualifi ed to discuss ultimate being. I didn’t say you weren’t. That’s the way I do The Forum.
(to Doris)
Okay? 
Being-in-the-world: Being-in
An important term that Werner Erhard often employs in his work, 
and one which is central in the thinking of Martin Heidegger is 
Being-in-the-world. To indicate clearly that a human being in his 
model of things is not a self-contained Cartesian subject, separate 
from an objective world “out there,” Heidegger never presents 
Dasein’s Being as disconnected, either from others or from the 
world. Dasein’s Being is Being-in-the-world. This indicates “a
unitary phenomenon” which “must be seen as a whole” (
y
BT 78).
T
However, while “Being-in-the-world cannot be broken up into 
contents which may be pieced together,” the constituent parts 
may be “brought out for emphasis.” One of these parts is Being-in.
