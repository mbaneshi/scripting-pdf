WES
Yeah. You give reasons for not doing it.
NICOLE
Yes.
WES
And lies about it. Right?
(Nicole nods)
And there’s other things that you’re not doing that you don’t feel the need to give reasons for
and lies about.
NICOLE
Yes.
WES
How come you feel the need to do it in this thing, which is a problem and not in the other thing?
NICOLE
Because it has to get done.
WES
Close. Close. “It has to get done” has got some quality in it. It’s like that. Now, see, there’s some
things that have to get done and they’re getting done. This other thing has to get done, and it’s
not getting done. And what’s your relationship to that?
NICOLE
I make myself wrong.
WES
Yeah. Now it’s closer. Someone or something is being made wrong. You see that?
NICOLE
Yeah.
WES
That’s at the source of a problem. The box that problems come in is called shouldn’t be.
(writing “shouldn’t be” above the square on the chalkboard)
“I’m not getting my thesis done”: that shouldn’t be. “There’s something wrong here.” “I should be thin;
I keep eating. That shouldn’t be.” It’s not like, “hey, I’m fat, dig it.” It’s not like “Hey stupid-ass thesis.
Primordial Metaphor: Clearing
Earth—the planet—existed prior to the emergence of human be-
ings. The world as clearing did not “exist,” however, since “world”
d
is a meaningful phenomenon, and meaning emerged on the planet
concurrently with human beings.
One interesting view of the way the world came into being
was proposed by the eighteenth-century Italian philosopher

SPEAKING BEING
I’ll just keep lying to people so that they keep giving me grant money. I don’t care.” But no, that’s not
your relationship to your thesis, but it could be. You wouldn’t have a problem: You’d have a scam.
(laughter)r
What turns it into a problem is “it shouldn’t be.” “I should be doing this thing and I’m not
getting it done.” “Not getting it done” shouldn’t be. The box that problems occur in is “shouldn’t
be.” It’s kind of obvious, right?
NICOLE
Yeah.
WES
You’re waiting for the heavens to part. They’re not going to part; you just may get a powerful
and profound insight that may let you get your damn thesis done.
NICOLE
True.
WES
Can you see that the occurrence “not getting thesis done” occurs “shouldn’t be”? That whole
thing?
NICOLE
Yeah.
WES
Great. And where does “shouldn’t be” occur? Does “shouldn’t be” occur in the thesis?
NICOLE
No.
WES
Does “shouldn’t be” occur in the ceiling?
NICOLE
No.
WES
No. “Shouldn’t be” occurs where?
(Nicole points to her mouth)
Very good Nicole. Thanks.
Giambattista Vico. Like Martin Heidegger, Vico perceived a lost power
in the thinking of the ancients. His interest in the thinking of the
“first men,” those who shaped the early use of language, anticipated
Heidegger’s persistent attempt to reconstruct the understanding of
the pre-Socratic Greek thinkers. Like Heidegger, Vico understood that
he was entering shadowy territory: it is beyond our power, he said,
“to enter into the vast imagination of those first men, whose minds
were not in the least abstract, refined, or spiritualized, because they
were entirely immersed in the senses, buff eted by the passions,
buried in the body” (The New Science 118).
But his exploration of this realm led him to develop a theory
of primordial metaphor that resonates with Heidegger’s distinc-
r
tion of originary naming. Metaphor, for Vico, was based in identity
rather than similarity (James M. Edie, Speaking and Meaning: The
Phenomenology of Language 166). It was a theory of first thought;
according to the scholar Donald Phillip Verene, Vico proposed that
the mind’s cardinal act was “a transference or bearing of meaning
from sensation as placeless, momentary flux to the fixation of sen-
sation as a god.” Thus, through metaphor, the beings were brought
into Being. Says Verene: “Metaphor can be understood as likeness
or similarity only if we ignore its role in relation to the is. To regard
the constructive power of metaphor as based on its analogical
capacity is also to presuppose its primordial power to construct
the is” (Vico’s Science of Imagination 174).
There was, then, a moment at the dawn of time when hu-
mans brought forth beings through the creation of metaphors. On
this view, whether we recognize it or not, we are already always
thinking and speaking from within the metaphors that have
been constructed and then passed down in our tradition, meta-
phors that generate assumptions about what is possible in being
human. The philosopher Richard Rorty has proposed that what
we should be doing as thinking beings is using up the metaphors
that we have inherited, and creating new ones. Not to do so, says
Rorty, is to worship the dead metaphors of our ancestors (Contin-
gency, Irony, and Solidarity 20). The work of Martin Heidegger and
Werner Erhard may be seen as the creation of new metaphors.
An important Heideggerian metaphor that Erhard has adapted
for use in his own work is the term clearing. “Clearing” is a metaphor
