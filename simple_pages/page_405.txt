WES
They are close enough for now. People who sign are participating in languaging. Here’s what
I’m including in languaging: picturing, signing, speaking, music-ing: that whole range of 
human activities in which communication takes place. The easiest thing for us to talk about is
speaking and listening. 
PAULA
What about touching?
WES
What about touching?
PAULA
To me, touching can be communicating.
WES
It can be, and it may not be...
PAULA
Are you including it...?
WES
...if it’s an intentional communication.
PAULA
Okay.
(sits down)
WES
Okay, so problems occur in languaging. Is there anyone who cannot see that? Clear enough.
Close enough... for government work. 
(laughter)r
DAVID
I’m not really clear that the problem is in languaging.
WES
Yeah. Where is it? Give me a problem you got?
DAVID
Fully participating in the projects that I do. Getting excited by the projects.
