(applause)
At this point Jane raised her hand. When she stood, her appearance was strikingly diff erent, and the 
participants applauded.
ERHARD (to Jane)
Do you know what they’re clapping about?
JANE
No.
(laughter)
ERHARD
People don’t clap for ugly worthless people, do they?
JANE
No.
ERHARD
So you know what they’re clapping about?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
They’re clapping in part due to your attractiveness, which comes from your being a big, 
generous person. 
JANE
Hmm hhmmm.
(laughter)
ERHARD
You got that didn’t you? You’ve been big and generous in our conversations, haven’t you?
JANE
Yeah.
ERHARD
Good. Nothing to be embarrassed about there. Nothing to be caught in. They’re also clapping for 
another kind of generosity and that’s the generosity that they think they see and that I think I see in 
your beginning to get off  it. Like getting off  your act about being worthless. All those other things.
