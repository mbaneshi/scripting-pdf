Simply, it’s nonexistent.

Or: The fl oor is down there because...
BILL
There’s no “because” to the fl oor being down there.
KIPP
The fl oor is down there because...
BILL
There’s no reason for it to be down there.
KIPP
And the fl oor is down there because...
BILL (laughing)
It doesn’t have a because. Because somebody built it and stuck it there.
KIPP
The fl oor is down there because...
BILL
I shouldn’t have volunteered to continue with this. I seem to be losing it.
KIPP
That’s fi ne. That’s the diff erence between a distinction and a defi nition. You can’t get a distinc-
tion by defi ning it, or exampling it; you can only get it by creating it... So the fl oor is down there
because... Okay, forget about the fl oor, but the ceiling’s up there because...
BILL (looking up)
Because it’s there.
KIPP
Where? Up there, right? The ceiling’s up there because it’s up there.
BILL
...because the ceiling’s up there. Is that correct?
Forum Day Four: Session Two
435
KIPP
I don’t know if it’s correct or not, but the ceiling’s up there because the ceiling is up there, isn’t
it? And Ashley is the way that Ashley is, and the fl oor is down there because the fl oor is down
there, and the ceiling is up there because the ceiling is up there, and the sound of one hand
clapping is... What’s the sound of one hand clapping?
BILL
There is no sound.
KIPP
That’s one interpretation. What’s another one?
BILL
It doesn’t make any sense.
KIPP
Right. And what does make sense is your reasons. Choice doesn’t make sense. It just is. So the
sound of one hand clapping is...
(Bill swings his left hand back and forth)
What is that?
BILL (to applause and laughter)r
It’s the sound of one hand clapping.
KIPP
They got it, but I don’t know if you got it. The sound of one hand clapping is the...
BILL (smiling and to applause)
Sound of one hand clapping.
KIPP
The sound of one hand clapping is always the sound of one hand clapping, isn’t it?
BILL
Right.
KIPP
You cannot answer what they call in Zen a koan—a little riddle given by a Zen master to someone
studying Zen—you cannot answer that koan in your mind. You’ve got to be out of your mind.
436
SPEAKING BEING
And all you’ve had so far to operate from in life is your mind. All you’ve had is your reasons,
your thoughts, your feelings, your considerations, for action. It’s all you’ve been given by hu-
man being to do something: You’ve had to decide and have a reason for your actions. But as you
have demonstrated for us, we can distinguish that choice is based on what? It’s based on...
BILL
Your choice.
KIPP
Exactly. It’s simply your choice. Now which is more risky? A decision or a choice?
BILL
Choice.
KIPP
Exactly. Because as long as you have your reasons, if it doesn’t go well, if it goes a way it
shouldn’t have gone, you can always say “See, it didn’t work out! Why?” That’s why people get
married. “Let’s see. I’ll get married because you’re nice looking, and we get along, and you want
to live in the same city I do, and all that other stuff , and then, when something happens and
the reasons for doing something stop being present in your life, well then, you question your
marriage, because your marriage isn’t based on you, you never got married. What got married
was your reasons. That’s not called a marriage, that’s called an entanglement. You see, you’ve
never chosen to work where you work. You wonder why you have no power where you work?
Because you’re not there. What’s got you there are your reasons. No power here, just force: just
trying to move around the reasons.
(to Bill)
Bill, you did an extraordinary job. And why you did an extraordinary job is because you were
absolutely authentic about it.
BILL
Thank you.
KIPP
Why I appreciate it and why everyone in the room appreciates it is because you never stopped
looking and inquiring. Most people, when they don’t see it right away...
(referring to the quote Erhard read from On the Way to Language)
Heidegger says that the kind of beings that human beings are, we’re born thinking that we
comprehend everything, you know, everything is comprehendible. And so if something
is not comprehendible, the best we can do is be off ended by it. We’re off ended by what we
KIPP (continuing)
Forum Day Four: Session Two
437
don’t comprehend versus being willing to think. In order to create that distinction, Bill, and
if you were sitting in your chair doing the demonstration, you had to think. It wasn’t given by
thoughts; you had to really think. So I’m asking you to start thinking that thinking and distin-
guishing are synonymous—not perfectly, not neatly. But you have to think to get a distinction,
to bring forth distinction.
(to Bill)
And that’s what you were willing to do. And you were big about it. And we appreciate it.
Bill returned to his seat as the group applauded. Another participant, Joan, raised her hand and
stood.
JOAN
I feel really stupid. I didn’t get it.
KIPP
Okay. What didn’t you get?
JOAN (in tears)
I don’t understand how to make a choice without a reason.
KIPP
The reasons are still there, aren’t they? They don’t go away.
JOAN
No they don’t. I have a zillion of them.
KIPP
What’s a current choice you need to make?
JOAN
Figuring out what I want to do with my life. It sounds really stupid. What I want to do for a job.
KIPP
Okay. “What I want to do for a job.” You have a couple diff erent ideas?
JOAN
Yes.
KIPP
Okay good. What are the ideas?
438
SPEAKING BEING
JOAN
Start my own business.
KIPP
Okay.
JOAN
Or work for a small company.
KIPP
Let’s take those two for an example, Okay? Start your own business, work for a small company:
choose!
JOAN (laughing)
Start my own company.
KIPP
Perfect! Now why are you going to start your own company? “I’m going to start my own compa-
ny because...”
JOAN
Because my father did.
KIPP
Perfect reason! That’s an example of a decision. What has you now starting your own company
is your father did that: That’s not you making a choice, is it? It’s your father, so if it doesn’t work
out, you can kick the shit out of your father.
(laughter)r
Decisions get you off  the hook, don’t they? Because the reason “because my father did” has you
starting your own company, not you. When you make a choice, you’re the chooser. You can
still have all the thoughts; you can still carefully consider it all. I’m not saying to throw out the
analysis. But if what you do is based on your analysis, I promise you a future determined by
the past. Because analysis is always looking where? What’s already happened! And so far, that’s
where you look in your life. You go:
(contorting his body to look behind him)
“Let’s see what’s possible in my life.”
JOAN (laughing)
Yes I do that.
Forum Day Four: Session Two
439
KIPP (to the group)
And everything we’re starting to distinguish—you didn’t come equipped with this. You’ve got
to invent it. We’re beginning to invent a body of distinctions beyond what you got when you
became a human being. You’re not used to this; it’s going to take real thinking. This is what
Einstein was talking about: The problems that we’ve got are not going to be solved at the level of
thinking that created them. What’s required is a new level of thinking. Choice requires thinking.
(to Joan)
Start your own business or work for a small company: choose!
JOAN
Start my own business.
KIPP
Great! And why did you make that choice? “I’m going to start my own company because...”
JOAN
...because if I don’t do it in my life, I’m going to be really disappointed.
KIPP
Perfect decision! The reason “because I’ll really be disappointed”—that’s what’s getting you
going again, that reason. Choice isn’t based on that, it’s to select freely: You are the chooser. You
simply choose because you choose. You can still look at all that stuff . Look at this part of it and
that part of it, but when it comes to a choice it’s you choosing. Ready? Start your own business,
work for a small company: choose!
JOAN
I choose starting my own company because it’s what I want to do.
KIPP
That’s a wonderful want.
JOAN
Because I think I should do it.
KIPP
And your wants and shoulds, which are totally a product of your past, now have you starting
your own small business and what you’re going to be given—see the important thing is—if
that’s what gets her into that game, she’s going to have whatever she’s got from her past. Every-
thing she needs for that is going to be given by the past because she’s not there starting her own
small business; it’s the past starting her own small business, and she’ll have whatever power,
ability, excellence, and all that other stuff  she’s got from her past, and not “you,” because you
440
SPEAKING BEING
haven’t started your own business yet; the past is: all the reasons for doing it, right? Now, start
your own business, work for a small company: choose!
JOAN
Start my own company.
KIPP
Good. Now why are you going to start your own company?
JOAN
Because it sounds like fun.
KIPP
Good. Then when it’s not fun, you’re going to go: “Well, this really wasn’t fun! I really thought
it was going to be fun, but now it’s not, so now I’m not going to do it anymore.” Do you under-
stand? Are you hearing your own reasons?
JOAN
Here are my reasons...
KIPP
By the way, they aren’t even your reasons. They are reasons given to you by being human.
JOAN
Does choosing have anything to do with looking forward with nothing out there and not look-
ing behind you?
KIPP (now face-to-face with Joan)
It’s got to do with you saying so. You being the chooser. When you make a choice, you’re the
chooser. When you make a decision, the reasons are doing the deciding, not you.
JOAN
Okay.
KIPP
Start your own business, work for a small company: choose!
JOAN
I’ll choose working for a small company.
KIPP
Okay. Fine. And why are you going to do that? Neither one is better than the other. That’s fi ne.
We’re just distinguishing choice. “I choose to work for a small company because...”
KIPP (continuing)
Forum Day Four: Session Two
441
JOAN
Because I’m into suff ering.
KIPP
Okay good! Can you hear that that’s a decision?
JOAN
Yeah.
KIPP
And it’s a decision because the reason “I’m into suff ering” is doing the selecting, not you. You’re
the chooser. When you make a choice it’s based on nothing except you saying so. You are the
chooser. This is why it’s so diffi  cult, because your entire life has been used to reduce the risk.
Choice is going to put you fully into risk. You make the choice, you’re at risk, with no back door.
Start your own business, work for a small company: choose!
JOAN
My own company.
KIPP
Good. “I choose to start my own company because...”
JOAN (to applause)
Because I chose it.
KIPP
Because you choose it, yeah. And she messed up a little bit because she said she “chose” it.
Choice is never in the past. It’s only right now and right now and right now and right now. And
you wonder why the aliveness, the enthusiasm, the possibility starts disappearing from those
choices you’ve made in your life, it’s because you’ve stopped choosing. See you chose once...
(brushing hands together)r
“I chose fi fteen years ago! What do you want?” No, a choice is right now and right now and
right now and right now. Risky, huh?
JOAN
Yeah, that’s what I’ve been looking at the whole four days here, is that risk.
442
SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
Which risk?
JOAN
Choosing. Choosing to be out there.
KIPP
Right. That is the risk. That’s what everybody here is up against. Nobody here is interested in liv-
ing their lives; they are very interested in having their reasons design their life—their thoughts,
their feelings, their considerations, not them, “not me! Then I couldn’t complain!” See, if you
choose, you can’t complain. It’s what everybody in here is up against. And what it is to be a
human being is to avoid responsibility. You cannot make somebody else responsible. You’ve
already tried doing that. You can’t even make yourself responsible. You can only choose to be
responsible. But we haven’t distinguished responsibility yet. Choice equals freedom because it’s
you choosing, not some reason.  I didn’t say reasons were bad. They just don’t give you: you!
JOAN
I got it.
KIPP
Thanks for staying with it.
Another participant stood.
ROSS
Somewhere along the line I got stuck in that you have to choose yes, and that if you choose no,
it’s not a real choice.
KIPP
No, no, no, they are both the same. A choice is a choice. So “I choose no because I choose no.”
ROSS
Whenever I’m presented with a choice...
KIPP
Notice how you said that: as if it is an edict. “Whenever I’m presented with a choice, at all times...”
ROSS
Sometimes when I am presented with a choice, I choose yes because, who would say no?
KIPP
But that’s not a choice then. That’s the reason: “Why would somebody say no?” That’s a deci-
sion, not a choice. A choice is a choice. You choosing for no reason, simply because you say so.
Forum Day Four: Session Two
443
ROSS
I had this distinction of choice at some point, and then I made a choice called “no” when I
really wanted to say “yes,” and now I can’t say no anymore. So when faced with big things, real
choices, I say yes, and then look around and say “what did I get myself into?”
KIPP
Consider that you lost the distinction “choice.” It got folded back into reasons and thoughts
and feelings. What’s going to empower you in the matter is to work with this choice business,
to actually see: “Oh I see, choice is simply a choice. Me choosing. I choose whatever because I
choose whatever. You stopped being the chooser. You called a decision a choice and got them
muddled up again.
ROSS (hesitant)
Yeah...
At this point Wes rejoined the conversation.
WES
We’re not saying choice is right. We’re saying choice is choice. We’re not saying decision is
wrong. We’re saying decision is decision. They’re diff erent games. You don’t want to play one
game and call it the other. That’s pretty silly. Mixing them up is like dressing up to play football
and then walking out onto the baseball fi eld, and the pitcher throws the ball to the catcher and
you tackle the catcher.
(laughter)r
Does that look like your life Ross?
ROSS
Exactly. I really got that because sometimes the circumstances are really overwhelming and I
give into them, and instead of saying that I gave in to the circumstances and made a decision, I
say “Oh, I chose that.”
WES
You should decide when deciding is the game you want to play and be responsible for the pro-
cess called decision. Choosing is distinguishing a way of being with life. And there are appropri-
ate times for deciding.
ROSS
Or at least be clear when you decided or when you chose. At least you’re on the right ball fi eld
and can play that game.
WES
In your game—you’re a physician, right?—you better make decisions.
444
SPEAKING BEING
ROSS
Sure. Lidocaine, epinephrine...
WES (to laughter)r
Well, “I did the operation because I chose to.” You get in a lot of trouble that way. That’s not
responsible. Choice puts you into a certain relationship to life like “responsible for.” It shifts your
relationship to what is. So now we need to do the real choice demo, right? So, all that stuff  we did?
That wasn’t it. We’re close. We did the “getting up to this place” choice demonstration. We haven’t
done the real one yet. There’s an illusion in the one we just did, which we are going to handle.
KIPP
So we want to distinguish choice as choice. Okay, ready?
(holding out one hand to a participant, Andy)
Chocolate. Choose.
ANDY
Chocolate.
KIPP
Chocolate: How come you chose chocolate?
ANDY
Because I chose chocolate.
KIPP
Yeah. And what else was there?
ANDY
No choice at all...
KIPP
Was there anything else other than chocolate?
ANDY
Yes.
KIPP
Where? Chocolate: choose!
ANDY
I choose chocolate.
Forum Day Four: Session Two
445
KIPP
Yeah. Was there anything else?
ANDY
There was a choice not to choose chocolate.
KIPP
Where was the “not choose chocolate”? Chocolate: choose! Where did you get the “not choice”?
There was no “not choice.” Chocolate: choose!
ANDY
I choose chocolate.
KIPP
Right and that’s all that was there, right?
(laughter)r
Don’t you think that choice is selecting options?
ANDY
Yes.
KIPP
When you come down to it, you are that choice is selecting options. Choice is not selecting options.
Choice is choosing what you’ve got. Chocolate: choose! And you go “Where’s the strawberry?”
(laughter)r
What strawberry? What “not choice”? What vanilla? Chocolate: choose! This business called
being? There’s no such thing as being in here.
(pointing to his chest
(
)
Being is giving being. What is giving being? Giving being is very much like choosing chocolate
when what you’ve got is chocolate. And it’s operationally true that whatever you can grant be-
ing to, allows you to be. It works in operation that whatever you can grant being to, allows you
to be. What happened? Chocolate: choose! Can you grant being, can you choose chocolate? Life
is presenting you, moment by moment by moment by moment everything that it presents you.
And what do you keep doing? Well, “not that! Not that! Not that! Not that!” And the moment
you say “Not that!” The moment you don’t choose: no being. Being is granting, or giving, being.
And granting or giving being is very much like choosing chocolate when what you’ve got is
chocolate. What’s the diff erence between the ordinary quarterback and an extraordinary quar-
terback? They both do the same things: The ordinary quarterback goes to the sidelines and talks
to the coach about what the defense is going to run. They walk out on the fi eld...
446
SPEAKING BEING
(grabbing a dictionary from the podium)
The ordinary quarterback walks out on the fi eld and goes “Ready! Hike!” And the defense
doesn’t do what he thought it was going to do. So the ordinary quarterback goes “Ready! Hike!”
(Throwing the dictionary down on the ground and walks away from it, to laughter and applause,
and then walks back and snatches up the dictionary)
The extraordinary quarterback goes to the sidelines and talks to the coach about what the defense
is going to run. The extraordinary quarterback walks out on the fi eld and goes “Ready! Hike!”
And when the defense doesn’t do what he thought it was going to do, he steps back into the
pocket and gets the ball down the fi eld. He’s not waiting for life to be any other way than it is. He
chooses whatever’s happening as it’s happening. He can be with life. That’s choice. Choice is be-
ing with whatever is there, whatever life presents you with. The fi rst thing you’ve got to be willing
to be with is your own racket. It’s taken you three days of hard work to be with the racket you’ve
got. Pretty powerful. I’ve had the privilege of leading The Forum when—at this point—a gentle-
man in a wheelchair came forward and took the microphone and said “Cerebral Palsy: choose!”
Or in a Forum for prisoners, where someone comes up and says “Jackson Prison: choose!”
Because at that moment they stop serving time and time starts serving them, because they choose
what they’ve got. Are you willing to choose what you’ve got? I didn’t say succumb. I didn’t say
submit. I said choose. Grant being. Give being like “chocolate: choose!” So far in life you’ve been
trained to—“Chocolate: choose!” “No! What the hell are you giving me this chocolate for?!”
(laughter)r
“Why do I have to be fat? That person’s racket is that they’re lonely. Why can’t I have lonely as a
racket?”
(laughter)r
What’s going to have you be powerful in life is your choosing moment to moment. Choice isn’t
selecting options. It’s granting being, giving being and granting being is very much like choos-
ing chocolate when what you’ve got is chocolate. The moment you can be with it, something
opens up. Andy, thank you very much for that work.
(Andy sits to applause
(
)
In a moment we’re going to go on a meal break. During the meal break, I’m asking you to con-
tinue to inquire into this distinction of choice, and to see how much you’re willing to choose. So
far in life you’ve got this little teeny-weeny opening for yourself. You know, if you say that and
they say that; and life acts like that and it doesn’t act like that, “that I’m willing to grant being
to.” See, what the rest of your life is going to be about is, if you take this on, what mastery is
about, is simply opening up and opening up and opening up and opening up what you’re will-
ing to be with. When you’re only willing to be with a tiny part of life, you’ll only have a tiny life.
Be willing to open up with what you’re willing to open up to, to be with. It’s easy in here, and
when you go out there it isn’t so easy. You’ll be sitting there, choosing, and someone across from
you will be eating with their mouth open and you’ll want to stick a fork in their forehead.
KIPP (continuing)
Forum Day Four: Session Two
447
(laughter)r
Because you can’t choose mouth open with food in it. “Not that! No, not that!” You’ve got no
mastery yet. You’ve got no muscles for living your life yet. You’ve got a lot of muscles for per-
sisting and a lot of muscles for surviving, but no muscles for living, and the rest of the Forum
is committed to bringing forth a body of distinctions to give you those muscles. To begin to: It’s
not over in just four days. You’re not going to get a PhD in four days. It’s a beginning. A break-
through. An opening. I’m inviting you during the meal break to inquire into this distinction
choice. To notice what you’re willing to choose and mostly what you are not willing to choose.
Not like you’re bad, not like you’re wrong: just like you’ve cut out most of life for yourself. So far
your life has had to be consistent with your racket and that’s all that’s been available to you. I’m
inviting you to open that up for yourself.
Kipp announced that an opportunity to register into the seminar would occur after the meal break.
The Forum supervisor announced a dinner break at 4:35 pm, and that The Forum would begin again
at 6:35 pm.

SPEAKING BEING
The Forgetting of Being, Part Eight of Eight: The Heart of
the Matter
A significant moment in the development of Western thinking, for Martin Heidegger,
was that point in ancient Greek history that he calls the “the inceptive end of the
great inception” (IM 200). The great inception was the new possibility for Being-
in-the-world that emerged in the thinking of the pre-Socratics; and this possibility
reached its end with Plato. The end of a great possibility, however, does not occur as
the culmination of a decline:
The great begins great, sustains itself only through the free
recurrence of greatness, and if it is great, also comes to an
end in greatness. So it is with the philosophy of the Greeks.
It came to an end in greatness with Aristotle. (IM 17)
This process, which Heidegger calls “the play of Being,” has proceeded in such a way
that “this ‘inception’ also covered up the inceptive inception” (IM 200). This is why
current students of Western philosophy begin their studies with Plato and Aristotle:
the great inception of the pre-Socratics has been subsumed by the metaphysical
tradition of Western thinking, which has demonstrated its own greatness, and has
created the circumstances of its own end.
Plato’s role in this development lay in his reinterpretation of physis—which for
the pre-Socratics was the self-blossoming emergence of beings into the world—as
eidos, or idea. Here Heidegger suggests the implications of this move:
We can easily assess the distance between the two intepre-
tations if we pay attention to the diff erence between the
perspectives in which these essential determinations of
Being, physis and idea, move. Physis is the emerging sway,
the standing-there-in-itself, constancy. Idea, the look as
what is seen, is a determination of the constant insofar as,
and only insofar as, it stands opposed to a seeing. (IM 203,
emphasis added)
For Platonic thinking, then, the term idea had quite specific implications: “The word idea
means what is seen in the visible, the view that something offers. What is offered is the
current look or eidos of whatever we encounter” (IM 201).  Emergence has been captured
in appearance.
“
SESSION TWO INTERVAL
As this development has played itself out, therefore, the visible and substantial
outcome of unconcealment (i.e., the being that is unconcealed) has come to sub-
sume in understanding the process by and through which that being has emerged.
Idea, the “whatness” of beings, becomes the definitive interpretation of Being. Even-
tually, when Greek terms were translated into Latin by the Romans, physis became
natura. Nature, the manifestation of physis which is most visible and accessible to
us, in time came to represent Being.
Being was thereby enshrined in language as beings. But an element has gone
missing in that enshrinement, says Heidegger, since “to be the Being of beings is the
matter of Being” (EGT 50). Thus a puzzle arose, a puzzle in the languaging of Be-ing;
and the puzzle lay in the unobtrusive but critical word “of”:
The grammatical form of this enigmatic, ambiguous gen-
itive [“of”] indicates a genesis, the emergence of what is
present from presencing. Yet the essence of this emergence
remains concealed along with the essence of these two
words [“Being” and “beings”]. Not only that, but the very
relation between presencing and what is present remains
unthought. (EGT 50)
The thinking of both Heidegger and Werner Erhard is designed to distinguish this
relation between Being and beings, and to retrieve this relation from oblivion.
Subsequent to the oblivion of this relation, the question of Being, now under-
stood as a higher being, had to look beyond other beings in an attempt to find its
subject. For the Greeks, the tradition which placed Being beyond nature became
meta ta physika. Furthermore, this metaphysical separation of essence from exis-
tence was set firmly in place for the Western tradition by the thinking of Plato:
...Being as idea was elevated to a suprasensory realm.
The chasm, khorismos, was torn open between the merely
apparent beings here below and the real Being somewhere
up there. Christian doctrine then established itself in this
chasm, while at the same time reinterpreting the Below
as the created and the Above as the creator [. . .]. And so
Nietzsche is right to say that Christianity is Platonism for
the people. (IM 116)
We are approaching the heart of the matter with regard to the question which has
generated this inquiry: Why does the transformational experience that is made available
in The Forum occur as elusive, evasive, as a get-it-and-lose-it phenomenon?
“
“
“
Forum Day Four: Session Two Interval 449
It is the authors’ policy, consistent with the thinking we are exploring, to allow
questions to remain open, and if possible to open them further. We therefore pro-
pose this response that opens up a new line of inquiry: it is the nature of Being to
withdraw.
[T]his concealing of its essence and of its essential origin is
characteristic of Being’ s primordial self-illumination. . . .
The being itself does not step into this light of Being. The
unconcealment of beings, the brightness granted them,
obscures the light of Being. As it reveals itself in beings,
Being withdraws. [. . .] Man’s inability to see himself corre-
sponds to the self-concealing of the lighting of Being. (EGT
26, emphasis added)
Being is always the context of meaninglessness from which the meanings have
emerged, the everything/nothing of the sway from which the Greeks struggled to
bring forth beings. Not-Being is Being’s flipside, and must remain its persistent ori-
entation, as Heidegger finds in this passage from the pre-Socratic thinker Heraclitus
(Fragment 123):
Physis kryptesthai philei: Being [emerging appearance] in-
trinsically inclines toward self-concealment. Being means:
to appear in emerging, to step forth out of concealment—
and for this very reason, concealment and the provenance
from concealment essentially belong to Being. Such prove-
nance lies in the essence of Being, of what appears as such.
Being remains inclined toward concealment, whether in
great veiling and silence, or in the most superficial distort-
ing and obscuring. (IM 126, emphases added)
It is essential to recognize, then, that the emergence of physis into the world, and
the unconcealment of Being’s truth that is manifested in such emergence, is never a
once-and-for-all event.
It is the power of logos to hold together what tends apart, maintaining the
oppositional tendencies of that which it gathers in “the highest acuteness of its ten-
sion” (IM 149). But this is not achieved without human participation in the struggle:
“Where struggle ceases, beings indeed do not disappear, but world turns away”

The mystery of Being, for the fortunate among us, may cease for a moment to
be a mystery. That moment may be a minute, a month, or even a year. But inevita-
“
“
bly the mystery becomes again a mystery, a puzzlement. Finding one’s way back
into the heart of the mystery is the adventure of emergence returning to conceal-
ment and emerging and returning to concealment. It is the ongoing challenge of
transformation.

SPEAKING BEING
When The Forum resumed at 6:35 pm, following the dinner break, Wes and Kipp were on the
platform. Kipp began the session requesting that participants share what they had seen about
“choice.” The fi rst to respond was Mac, the man in a wheelchair who had previously complained on
the morning of Day Two about the late ending time of the fi rst day.
MAC
You’ll have to indulge me because I have a need to thank your organization for going out of
their way for me. It was generous. It was done with love and caring. Good stuff .
KIPP
You’re worth it.
MAC
Thanks.
KIPP
Thank you very much.
(applause)
MAC
I also have a need to share with you a progression. I came here and some of you remember that
I was kind of angry. The fi rst thing I said was “Goddamn it, what the hell are you keeping us up
for, to one o’clock, we need our sleep.” Someone I was carpooling with asked what I thought, and
I said, “Werner Erhard: He’s an asshole.” That’s how I started this. A lot of anger. The next day
they asked me, and I said, “You know, he’s not bad.” Today I am convinced he is a genius. And
all you guys really know your stuff , and really care about people, how to get the most for people.
I want to thank you because it has made a big diff erence in my life. I thought I knew a lot of
stuff , and I really don’t. I’ve discovered it doesn’t matter that I don’t know very much. What the
hell’s the diff erence? What is, is. That’s what I’ve discovered here today. I was having dinner and
someone asked what are we going to tell people what we got out of this and what it is all about?
We’ll tell them “Why don’t you go and experience it. It’s a hell of an experience. Period.” Because
I don’t know how to describe in words what has happened to me.
KIPP
You are in the sharing of yourself. Your sharing is the opening for action for people.
MAC
I get it.
KIPP
See, when you share like you just shared, Mac, people want to participate. Whatever opened up
for you in your life, the way you said it, is consistent with who people are. You just share your self.
SESSION THREE
Forum Day Four: Session Three 451
MAC
That is what we plan to do. And other issues have come up. For example, I told my wife, “You
know, we have a lot of tension around getting lost here in the Bay Area.” And we’ve gotten lost
a lot! You know, getting lost is like a way of life for us! So who I’m going to be the next time we
get lost, is lost. I’m going to let myself be lost and enjoy some new lost area!
(applause)
It’s genuine. It’s how I’m going to live! I’m amazed at the diff erence this is in my life! And how
did I get here? I’ve resisted this for something like ten years. I belong to a men’s group. Six of us.
Very intimate. Met twice a month. Five were involved with your program. I was not. I fought it.
I didn’t need it and I thought it was a bunch of shit. Okay? About six months ago my son called
me. He said “Dad, you know what? I just experienced something. I was at a Forum and I think
you ought to go.” I paused and listened to him. I was still resisting. And then he went and did
other programs and kept saying simply, “Dad, I think you ought to go.” And now I am going to
call him to thank him for the wonderful gift he has given me.
(long applause with many people standing)
KIPP
Thank you very much. What occurred to me when you were standing, acknowledging Mac,
you know, what brings tears to your eyes is being in the presence of your own magnifi cence.
As Mac spoke, what he opened up for you is being in the presence of your magnifi cence. He
was astounding as he is in his speaking and his generosity, but what’s present in the room is
who you are. And by the way, if you’re not that way right now—some of you are at the other
level of the roller coaster and you think you should be where the other people are standing and
cheering for Mac—don’t get sucked into that. Wherever you are is where you are.
WES
The other thing you want to get is how shitty you were before The Forum.
(laughter)
It might be useful for you to confront what you were like for those people who shared The Forum
with you, and who you were like for others in your life. Regardless of whether they shared with
you skillfully or not, they were committed to something. And that’s a lot more than most people
are up to. And you couldn’t help but be in the presence of the work when Mac shared. This is a big
person, and you remember he and I had that conversation about the ending time the other day.
Same person. And this is who Mac is now. I had to confront the same thing when I did The Forum.
I’m inviting you to confront it: who you have been for other people and who you can be. And as
you step out of The Forum into your life... you know, I know that Mac will share The Forum with
people, and he’ll do it as well as he does, and he’ll learn and he’ll do it better—sounds pretty good
right now—and no matter how great Mac will be, there will be people unwilling to get what he’s
really committed to, who will turn it into something. And the question will be whether Mac will
stop being committed to whatever he’s committed to in sharing The Forum, or will he continue on
in the face of that.

SPEAKING BEING
Kipp asked participants to raise hands to indicate how many guests (who had invited the current
participants to take The Forum) were coming at 9 pm, so that enough chairs could be set up to
accommodate them.
MAUREEN
When you said, “Chocolate: choose!” I started to cry, because I have this big trauma drama that
has taken me forever to get over, that if I told it to you, I could make you cry, and I could write a
whole soap opera about my childhood, I mean it is so good, right? And it always felt like I never
had a choice, and I worked through that stuff , and I could never like really be with it, and it was
like when you said “chocolate: choose!” I had that choice to choose it, and I didn’t, I resisted it, I
made people wrong, and ran my rackets on them, did a lot of crazy stuff , and I just sat back there
and cried because I got that you said that for me. You gave me a gift. Thank you for giving me that.
KIPP
You’re welcome. Good work!
(applause)
The gift, the satisfaction, is in the creating of the distinctions. There was something inherently
satisfying in the creating of the distinction, which gave her freedom. Like The Karate Kid,
washing cars, waxing cars: wax on, wax off . Wax on, wax off  didn’t seem like freedom to the
karate kid until he got out on the court and played, and he was left in the presence of karate.
Coaching doesn’t look like what you think it should.
JORIE
I just came back from dinner and I was talking to my brother—he is also in The Forum—and
I have been struggling with The Forum. I was grieving over the relationship with my parents,
because I realized I didn’t really know them, with their stories and my stories. And my brother
helped me. He said, at the same time I was grieving, instead of having to grieve, those times I
was, I could have accepted the possibility that now I can be friends with them and just accept
them, and fi nd out who they are instead of grieving about who they were, and being sad about
all the stories that they have. And also, this is my fi rst time to share. This is just the beginning,
like everybody said, and I cannot tell you how much freedom it has given me. Talking about
choice and decision, in every part of my life, and especially my job. I just wanted to share that.
KIPP
Sharing it empowers you. The more you share it and make it real for yourself, the more it’s you.
Fabulous. Thank you very much.
(applause)
VINNY
People who know me: I’m a very signifi cant guy. Very serious. I saw a racket of mine and how
it ties in during the choice exercise I wanted to share with everybody. What I do with people is
I make them authority fi gures. I don’t care who they are. Started off  with my fi rst wife. I made
her the boss: She was a couple years older than me. That was easy. Then I made my second wife
Forum Day Four: Session Three 453
the boss. She was eleven years younger than me. That was a little harder. It took longer but I
turned her into an authority fi gure. And if you’re over twenty I’ll do that to you.
(laughter)
Somehow I’ll make you boss. If you’re under twenty, I’ll have an edge for a little while. I didn’t
see the cost; didn’t see the racket very plainly until this Forum. And I saw that I did it at my job.
Also, I own a company. I’ve got three other partners, and one isn’t even an equal partner, he’s
got ten percent of the company. Two are younger than I am and I’ve turned them all into my
bosses. I made one into the president and I call him the boss. I’ll do that. You can count on that.
KIPP
It’s a great way to avoid the responsibility of your own power.
VINNY
Exactly, not to be dominated by my own power, and the cost is everywhere. But the choice, to
choose, the ability to choose that that’s that: That’s my racket. And to choose that—there’s a
tremendous freedom in that, tremendous possibility to actually not have to be run by the racket.
So thank you.
KIPP
Thank you!
MONTY (to laughter)
Thanks for calling on me, fi nally! It’s my fi rst share! I did the training in ’78 and I didn’t share,
a couple of seminars and I didn’t share. And when we were dealing with that fear thing the
other night, I couldn’t see my fear, but there was sadness. That was the feeling I got up. And I
get a lot of tears, through you and through everybody’s stories. But I can’t contact my fear. I’m
up to being scared shitless. That’s why I got up here to share; I always fi nd a way not to. And I’m
standing and it’s okay. Fear runs me. That’s my major racket. It makes it possible for me to be
invisible; it’s okay to be invisible and not count. Every mealtime I go through a panic, who am I
going to eat with? Am I going to be alone? Can I just walk off  into the city and avoid being with
anybody? Everyone’s been so generous to me. People gave me a ride back home. I’ve met more
people here in these days than I’ve met and been with.
(choking up)
I’m overwhelmed. I don’t know what this thing’s about, but the people in this room are
available to me.
KIPP
That’s what it’s about.
MONTY
I’m really getting that. And I’m so pissed off  that I’ve let myself be run by this fear thing, that I have
to be alone with no friends. It’s all horseshit. And so choosing that is kind of a challenge for me.
454
SPEAKING BEING
KIPP
Moment by moment by moment by moment choosing that.
MONTY
Right. In and out of, and I’m sure, I get I’m real excited about what I’ve realized and then it’s
gone.
KIPP
You have no muscles in this area yet. You have teeny-weeny baby muscles in this area. What
this work is about, what the seminar’s about is the Nautilus of Possibility.
(laughter)
It’s true! You have no muscles for this. You cannot stay unhooked for more than fi ve minutes.
Somebody who looks like your mother walks by, and you’re three years old: You’re gone! It’s not
bad to be weak. It’s just stupid to lie about it if you are. That’s what’s been disempowering you.
Not your weakness. It’s been your act of saying that you’re not. The moment you get to be weak,
you can start building some muscle. It’s going to take everything you got in your life. You’ve got
to have people around you that are more committed to you than you are.
MONTY
That’s what it is. The people I’ve met here are more committed to me than I’ve ever been
committed to myself in my whole life.
KIPP
The conversation that comes with being a human being is not on your side. On my pillow in the
morning, the conversation that’s never there—I never wake up into: “Why don’t you get up and
jog?”
(laughter)
Never, it’s always a committee about how many times I’ve done it already this week, what the
weather’s like, why I really shouldn’t today because I need my rest. It’s never on my side; it’s
always telling me: “Slow down. What are you doing this to yourself for? No jogging. What you
need to do for yourself is get up and go to the fridge, pull out that piece of chocolate cake you
didn’t eat last night, bring it back to your bed, eat it in bed, and then sleep some more.”
MONTY
It’s real easy for me to make, like you and Wes and Werner, and other people, like not... not be
like that. And therefore...
KIPP
We’re not like that? That’s true. Yeah, you can be like us someday.
(Monty laughs and so does Kipp)
He’s not sure!
Forum Day Four: Session Three 455
MONTY (to laughter)
I’m lost.
KIPP
Right. Yeah, it’s easy to make somebody else not be like that, therefore you can sell out. Because
if somebody has some quality, like leadership, or ability, or talent, or whatever that is, and you
don’t have that quality, that property, you get to say, “If I had that property, I would be great like
them, but since I don’t, I won’t.”
MONTY
Yeah.
KIPP
I don’t mind the interpretation “leadership,” you know, if there’s this stuff  called leadership,
except what I’ve noticed is, if you don’t have it, you’re out of luck. As long as there’s this stuff
called leadership, or skill, or talent, or ability, you’ve got to get it somewhere.
MONTY
Well that’s what I came here for.
KIPP
Exactly, or if leadership is a conversation, you’ve got access to it, don’t you? You have access to a
conversation?
MONTY
Yeah.
KIPP
Exactly. So I’m inviting you to consider that leadership or whatever it is that you see that calls
you to be is a conversation. And the conversation that you have been listening to is not worth
your life. That’s the one you’ve been honoring.
MONTY
Yeah. Good. Thanks.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 10)
When Werner was talking yesterday, or you were talking, and he talked about, if this work
“calls” to you in some way... When I participated in this work for the fi rst time thirteen years
ago, this work called to me. You know, I can remember sitting in that room in New York City,
present to that this was somehow how I knew life could be, like a possibility, really. Whether I
liked it or didn’t like it, or whether I felt like I belonged, or whether I felt like I didn’t belong,
I was called to that. It spoke to me. So I said “yes” to whatever was in front of me, and I kept
saying “yes,” and I kept saying “yes,” and I kept saying “yes.” And I’m left with a couple of
things out of this Forum for myself, and one is that...you know, I lead The Forum almost
456
SPEAKING BEING
every weekend, like you do, and I’m never not brought to my knees, like knocked out, by
what happens for people in The Forum, or really what The Forum is for people. And these
four days, sitting in this chair, in diff erent parts of the room, I saw that I had no idea what the
possibility of this Forum was, at all, in being a participant. Who walked in here four days ago
was, you know, “Yeah” to what life brings. But who’s walking out four days later is “Yes!” to
life. I don’t care what life brings me, I’m a “yes” to that. To be grateful, to be thankful, to be
blessed... I don’t know what the words are for that, but to be “yes,” to be able to be a “yes” to
life, that is the greatest gift. Thank you.
KIPP
Avril.
AVRIL
That’s what I wanted to talk about: choice.
KIPP
Good.
AVRIL
I defi nitely have my foot nailed to the fl oor in the area of choice. I’ve been trying to fi nd
satisfaction in my marriage. I’ve kind of tried all kinds of things, hoping about it, creating it. I
created it for about two weeks and that didn’t work. And about two years ago what I realized is
that what I keep doing is trying to do all this stuff  on top of “no.” And so it’s like, “oh!...”
KIPP
The clearing that you are in life is “no.” That’s what you’re saying?
AVRIL
Yes. It’s like “no” has me. And all the other stuff  is on top of that. And so then I fi nally thought,
“Okay, I got it. The choice is no!” So, I separated from my husband, and we’re both here to see
what to do about our marriage. I’ve got all the reasons to get divorced and all the reasons why
not to, and it seems like my choice is “no, I don’t want to be married.”
KIPP
These are two diff erent things. “My choice is no” and “I don’t want to be married” are distinct.
One’s a decision and one’s a choice.
AVRIL (weeping)
My choice is no, and I have this huge “should.”
KIPP
Yeah, that’s right.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 10, continuing)
Forum Day Four: Session Three 457
AVRIL
And I think that’s where I get mucked up, you know, the risk: The “should” is so huge that I
keep getting back into the mud with it.
KIPP
That’s why nobody wants choice. It leaves them being responsible. It’s much easier to be used
by whatever life gives you.
AVRIL
Where I feel confused is, when you say “take what you got.” What I got is my husband, so then I
think that...
KIPP
You don’t have your husband.
AVRIL
I have this marriage, this entanglement.
KIPP
What you’ve got is this question about your marriage. That’s what you’ve got.
AVRIL
That’s what I need to choose.
KIPP
That’s what you’ve got right now, right? This question about your marriage.
AVRIL
Right. I feel like I’ve had that for twelve years.
KIPP
That’s your drama, though. You’re pretty dramatic about the whole thing. I’m not trying to
reduce what it is to be married, to love somebody and not have it go according to your dreams,
and what comes along with that, but we’ve had a pretty straight conversation for four days, and
we can kind of cut the drama pretty easily now: to get on with your life. If you didn’t have this
question, this entanglement, what would you get on with? What’s the big payoff  in your life for
all these histrionics?
AVRIL
I feel like I’ve gotten on with it in every other area of my life except this one, and the payoff  is
that I don’t count, or rather, that’s the racket.
