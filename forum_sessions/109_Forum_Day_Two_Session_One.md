Forum Day Two: Session One

WES
You’re present to your anger.
MARSHA
I’m very present to my anger. And I am not a nice person. I’m really getting that I’m, a couple peo-
ple looked around here and “oh boy, what a bitch she is.” And I’m saying, I am the biggest fl aming
bitch. And I’ve covered that up for a long time.
WES (to the group)
Consider the possibility that you are a “covering-up.” I did not say you have a covering-up. I said
consider the possibility that you are a covering-up. See, when she deals with herself, deals with
the covering up; cheerleader on top of angry woman, but that’s who she is.
At this point (10:30 am) Erhard appeared at the back of the room, and spoke in response to the
conversation about covering up. His attire remained the same throughout The Forum: today the
sweater-vest was olive-green, the slacks brown.
ERHARD
The way it works operationally is—it’s something you’re afraid you might be—is angry. There’s
always a something happened—always, always. However it is that you are, there’s always a
“something happened” that caused that. And almost nobody knows that because they come at
the way they are from the conceptual side, from the descriptive side, from the explanatory side.
When you get to the source of the way you are, there’s always a “something happened.” You put
yourself together, fashioned yourself as you were growing up. We pay attention, particular atten-
tion to various aspects of what we call our selves, or what we might call, more accurately, your
identity at various eras of our growing up. In a certain era of your growing up, you were building
a certain part of your identity. And at another era you built another part of your identity. And
then sometimes you go back and put the fi nishing touches on something you built earlier. But I
want you to begin to be able to think that people are manufactured. You and I are constructed.
Whatever it is that you’re referring to when you say “I think,” whatever the “I” refers to, you call
that your self, or your identity—sometimes you’ll call it your personality. But whatever is being
referred to when you say “I think,” “I feel,” “I believe”; and it gets put together out of “what hap-
peneds”; and there’s a “what happened” for every piece of you. A lot of who you are, of how you
got to be the way you are, and a lot of what maintains your identity is a product of what you’re
afraid you might be. Something happened in Marsha’s life, and she decided it was wrong to be
angry, or she shouldn’t be angry, or only bad people are angry, or something like that.
(Marsha is weeping; Erhard addresses another participant)
Don’t help her. Thanks.
(continuing)
And she decided that was wrong or bad or something she shouldn’t be, and then she got to be
afraid that she might be that, and so she had to keep that down in the swamp, at the bottom of
the Valley of the Shadow of Death, and it’s been there for years, and it runs her life: what she’s
afraid she might be. See I don’t even know that she is angry. I don’t know that the truth about
implies the understanding of Others. This un-
derstanding, like any understanding, is not an
acquaintance derived from knowledge about
them, but a primordially existential kind of
Being, which, more than anything else, makes
such knowledge and acquaintance possible.
(BT 160–161)
Of course, says Heidegger, the factical development of my
relatedness with another human being will always depend upon
how well I have come to know myself. And here he makes a point
that is significant for our understanding of The Forum dynamic:
self-knowledge, he says, arises from relatedness to Others:
“
Of course it is indisputable that a lively mutual
acquaintanceship on the basis of Being-with,
oft en depends upon how far one’s own Dasein
has understood itself at the time; but this
means that it depends only upon how far one’s
essential Being with Others has made itself
transparent and has not disguised itself. And
that is possible only if Dasein, as Being-in-the-
world, already is with Others. (BT 162)
We propose that the transformation that occurs for participants
in The Forum is not an individual experience, but that the
self-knowledge it makes available arises mutually with an under-
standing of others.
This is the function of The Forum’s dialogic structure, in which
even participants who do not participate overtly in the conversa-
tion are able to find themselves in the sharing of others. Forum par-
ticipants are repeatedly exhorted to listen to others’ sharing “like
that’s you in some way speaking.” As the sharing continues, The
Forum leader persistently deconstructs each participant’s story
about his or her experience, and frames the experience instead in
the language of the distinctions being developed. The distinctions
gradually reveal the ontological structures underlying the expe-
riences, structures common to all of the experiences despite the
diff erences in their details.

SPEAKING BEING
Marsha is that she’s an angry person. I know that’s what’s running her life. Once she’s able to be
with being angry, once she’s able to give being to being angry, she might fi nd out she’s not angry
g
at all. But “not being angry” is going to run her life until she’s able to be angry. I know you don’t
get all that yet. You’re starting to get it. As you go along today you will get it. Before you get out
of here, you will get at the source of your identity. What happens if you get at the source of your
identity, somebody with a yellow name tag?
Participant (who is wearing a yellow name tag, i.e. someone doing The Forum for the fi rst time)
It doesn’t own you anymore.
ERHARD
Yeah. It’s that simple. This is something almost nobody knows. You’re now one of the few people in
the world that knows this. What everybody else in the world knows is that you’ve got to fi x what’s
wrong with you, you’ve got to avoid what’s bad, in you or in life. What you now know is any time
you get at the source of something, you are no longer limited to it. Most people would be afraid to do
what Marsha has done. They fi nd anger so abhorrent, that they are afraid they might fi nd out that
they are angry. And they can’t tolerate that, they can’t be with that, and so they never get to the being
angry like that’s a possible way of being; they fi ght against being angry, they reject it. In the 70s you
were supposed to let it all hang out. That’s indulging anger, that doesn’t work either. When you felt
angry you were supposed to spray it all over the place on people. That’s indulging the anger. That’s as
much bullshit as suppressing the anger. There’s a thing called responsibility. As I told you yesterday
you don’t know what that means yet, but we’ll get to it before we’re done here. Something close to
owning something, being able to be with it. So you want to take a look down in the swamp down
there at what you’re afraid you might be or hoped you weren’t, or don’t want to be. That’s where the
monsters are. The green slimy monsters of what you’re afraid to be are running your life. Most of us
would be afraid to get at it, because we’re afraid we might be
t
it. When you own that, at its source, it
e
no longer owns you. We’re afraid to get at it for fear that we might be it. What you’re afraid of owns
you. Marsha, what did you notice in there?
MARSHA
I notice that I’m angry at everybody and everything in this world.
Erhard (to the group)
You want to get the courage in that. She’s angry waiting to happen: already always angry. It’s all
over the place. It colors the clearing in which the world occurs for her. And only to the degree
she is willing to be with that, standing in front of 800 people and starting to communicate it,
you’re starting to be with it. That’s a lot diff erent than hoping you’re not that. You were saying?
MARSHA
There isn’t one person in this world that I’m not angry with.
ERHARD
And that’s sad for you.
Through this process, as people in the room hear their own
concerns repeatedly expressed in the speaking of others, not only
do they gain a new way of understanding their own situation, but
at the same time, through the mutuality implicit in the Forum’s
dialogic structure, the withness of Being-with-Others is gradually
brought to presence. The dialogue of The Forum thus unconceals
the possibility of a profound relationship of Being among human
beings. This relatedness, we propose, is at a deeper and more fun-
damental level than the diff erences—of race, ethnicity, religion, or
politics—that occur for us as persistent barriers to cooperation in
all aspects of our lives. Erhard’s work, and its expanding manifes-
tation in the current programs of Landmark Worldwide, create the
possibility for transcending those barriers. ■
ERHARD (continuing)

So you want to take a look down in the swamp
down there at what you’re afraid you might
be or hoped you weren’t, or don’t want to
be. That’s where the monsters are. The green
slimy monsters of what you’re afraid to be are
running your life. Most of us would be afraid to
get at it, because we’re afraid we might be it.
When you own that, at its source, it no longer
owns you.
