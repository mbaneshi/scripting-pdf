Forum Day Four: Session Three 499
BARRY
I’m a photographer.
ERHARD
Oh, I apologize: I forgot you were a photographer. I don’t want to know about taking pictures;
I want to know where the photographic image occurs. So if you show me a photograph: Where
does the image occur? It’s not on the paper.
BARRY
It’s the person who can recognize it there.
ERHARD
Where does that recognition happen?
BARRY
Through an association?
ERHARD
Not through association. The photographic image occurs in a medium called the possibility of
a photographic image. Now, how long is it going to take you to get this? This is pretty simple. A
photographic image occurs in a certain medium. The name of the medium is the possibility of
a photographic image. To say it a bit more rigorously, a photographic image occurs in a medium
called photographic image as a possibility. Photographic image as a presence, as an occurring,
occurs, happens in a medium called photographic image as a possibility. Is that clear?
BARRY
No.
ERHARD
Then you’re going to have to go home without that being clear then. Sorry. It’s hard.
(Barry sits)
The medium of occurrence is possibility. Possibility shapes the occurring. What Ellen and
I did was to shift the realm of possibility in which we were working. In one realm we were
working on the possibility of catching the ball. That had a smaller possibility for Ellen. In the
other realm we were working on the possibility of telling me which way the ball was spinning;
that had a bigger possibility for Ellen. Hence, the ball traveling at the same is speed, alters
its occurring speed, because occurring is a phenomenon which arises in a medium called
possibility. Not possibility like you mean possibility, something that might, maybe could,
maybe happen. Photographic image as a possibility is like—listen!—a clearing in which
photographic images can happen. It’s not a maybe, might. It’s not made up of photographic
images either. Photographic image as a possibility is not made up of photographic images,
any more than “two” as a possibility is made up of examples of two. As a matter of fact,
examples of two arise in the possibility “two.” So, access to your action, access to your feeling:
Enframing
For Heidegger, our technological understanding of Being emerges
in three stages: “challenging,” “standing-res erve,” and “enframing.”
Challenging
“The revealing that rules in modern technology,” Heidegger says
first, “is a challenging (Herausfordern), which puts to nature the
unreasonable demand that it supply energy which can be extracted
and stored as such.” Thus the “earth now reveals itself as a coal
mining district, the soil as a mineral deposit.” Heidegger protests
this development as a significant change from the days of “the old
windmill.” While the windmill served human beings, the call for its
service was left  to the wind’s blowing, since “the windmill does not
unlock energy from the air currents in order to store it.” Modern
technology, on the other hand, “sets upon nature,” always driving
on toward “the maximum yield at the minimum expense” (“QCT”

SPEAKING BEING
You’ve got no access to your feelings right now, do you? Yeah, you can’t feel sad if you want
to feel sad. You can’t be happy if you want to be happy. The circumstances determine your
happiness or your sadness. And all you got to deal with your feelings is fucking around with
your circumstances. So you do what you think you need to do to create circumstances that will
make you happy. And they don’t. They gratify you for a little while, and then you’re unhappy
again. So, to gain access to your actions, to gain access to your feelings and thoughts, as
actions so to speak, you need to see that your actions and thoughts and feelings are a correlate
with the occurring. And the occurring arises, occurs, in a medium called possibility. So now
the question is: “Well, how do I gain access to this possibility stuff ?” Because if I can shift
possibility, I can shift occurring; and if I can shift occurring, I can shift action. But you’ve got
to get possibility like I’m saying it, not like something that might happen. That’s an option.
Something that might happen is an option. That’s what Mike and I were talking about back
there, options. “If the ball is over there, I might be able to catch it.” That’s an option. “And if
it’s over here, it’s more likely that I’ll catch it.” That’s a better option. These are options, not
possibilities. Possibility doesn’t limit. It opens up. It frees one, not limits one. So possibility is
the medium of occurring, and occurring is the correlate of action. Does anybody not get that?
You’re starting to slide back into the fi rst day. You’re starting to wonder how to use this stuff .
“I don’t understand it.” What you’re really saying is “I don’t see its applicability. I don’t see
how I’m going to apply it, or use it. I don’t see how this is going to make me thinner, or richer,
or younger, or sexier. So I don’t understand it. If it isn’t going to make me thinner, or richer,
or younger, or sexier, then what is it?” So now the question is, “Where do I fi nd possibility?”
And the answer to that is in the ape never picking up the stick because he might fi nd bananas
hanging in the jungle clearing later on. Possibility arises in languaging. And I use the term
languaging instead of language so you don’t confuse what I’m talking about with vocabulary
and syntax and grammar. You know, music is languaging, action is languaging when it speaks,
and actions do speak don’t they? And “in a glass,” which is never said, and is yet present
without being said by virtue of what is said, that’s languaging too. And you want to know
what? Sitting in a chair is languaging. A lot of people would look at a chair and never sit in it.
It would look stupid to them: silly, uncomfortable, or nasty. Like sitting on two stakes sticking
up. You look at two stakes sticking up—that doesn’t look too comfortable to us. There are
people who look at a chair and don’t see it as a comfortable place to sit. It’s something to stand
on to get something in the cupboard that’s up high. Not a place to sit. And the way it occurs
to you is a product of languaging, not a product of what it is. Is a chair a chair? No, it’s not an
is chair, it’s an occurring chair. In other cultures it occurs as something to stand on to get up
to the cupboard that’s up high. It’s not an is chair; it’s an occurring chair. And your actions
with it are exactly like they are with the dictionary. Your actions are correlated to the object as
an occurring. So we’re sneaking up on a statement: You do have something to say about your
actions. You do have something to say about it. And why you have something to say about it is
because possibility arises in language.
At one point during this conversation, at about 10 pm, the doors to the room were opened and
about two hundred people fi led into the room and seated themselves in rows of chairs that had been
placed at the sides and rear. These were friends of the participants who had previously taken The
Forum, and who had been invited by them to join them, for this portion of the course.
in BW 320–321). As Michael E. Zimmerman has pointed out, this
new way of revealing has now overtaken even the windmill: “Forty
miles east of San Francisco in Livermore, California, thousands
of turbo-driven windmills cover the hills  as far as the eye can
see. The wind’s energy is, in fact, being  harnessed and stored to
produce electricity” (Heidegger’s Confrontation with Modernity
216). However, what stands in the way of windmills being really
useful as a power source is merely that no power can be generated
when the wind isn’t blowing. The solution, which is already likely
at hand, will be to invent super batteries that could store up the
energy for use and distribution when and where we need it. This
would transform the “freely flowing” wind into something stored
up, standing at the ready, in reserve.
Standing-Reserve
This situation reveals a second stage of the technological
understanding of Being, which Heidegger calls Bestand, or
standing-reserve. In this mode of revealing, says Heidegger,
“everything is ordered to stand by, to be immediately on hand,
indeed to stand there just so that it may be on call for a further
ordering” (“QCT” in BW 322). This mode of revealing distorts the
appearance of things: the airliner on the runway, for example,
“conceals itself as to what and how it is.”
Revealed, it stands on the taxi strip only as
standing-reserve, inasmuch as it is ordered to
insure the possibility of transportation. For this
it must be in its whole structure and in every
one of its constituent parts itself on call for
duty, i.e., ready for takeoff . (“QCT” in BW 322)
“
David Tabachnick has provided a useful contrast between
the old and new ways of revealing, between the techne of the
craft sman and the techne that we observe in current technology.
For the craft sman, “‘bringing-forth’ describes a working in
partnership or co-operation with the nature of materials to
construct an artifact, such as a chair or a house, while the
contemporary technologist is described as ‘challenging-forth’ or
changing the nature of materials to make them stronger, more
