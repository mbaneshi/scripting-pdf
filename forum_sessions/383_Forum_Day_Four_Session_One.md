Forum Day Four: Session One

JAKE
I was going to ask about the truth, but you already answered that question. But I wanted to also
share a little about my racket. I wanted to thank you. It sounds like you knew a little bit more
about me than I expected. I appreciate that.
ERHARD
I know about being human.
JAKE
It sounds to me that you know what my profession is. I have an attractive profession. It makes
me more attractive.
ERHARD
I have a profound respect for your profession. And I probably have more respect for it than
most of the people who do it. I see it as a very, very, very important opening for humanity. And
I know there are also people in your profession who also see your profession in that way, but
not a lot of them. There’s something very important in there that humanity has yet to explore. I
have a deep respect for design. A deep respect. And it’s a mystery I don’t get. But your partic-
ular profession would not be a bad place to explore the mystery of design. But exploring the
mystery of design is diff erent than just doing design.
JAKE
And that’s what I would want to do, but having it as a racket just fucks it all up. And I chose
the profession because it was an attractive profession. I chose it because I needed a job. I come
from a highly educated family, and there’s one time I thought I was going to be a bum.
ERHARD
And you decided against that.
JAKE
Yeah, I decided against that, so I went to school. I got a career: a degree and a license. And
I was lucky enough to pick a profession, which I now fi nd exciting, but it’s really fucked the
way—it could be a lot more exciting if I get this other shit out of the way.
ERHARD
Exactly. That’s very good. Jake and I have had enough interactions for something useful to
happen here. See I know it sounds in the beginning in particular—and for some of you it still
sounds like—that everything I say is an insult, everything I say is a put-down. I know that
some of you will describe this to people as “they called me bad names”; ”they beat me up”;
“They wouldn’t let me use the bathroom”; “He said ‘fuck’ and went like this.”

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (to laughter, making a gesture with his hands indicating the sex act)
I actually acknowledged that when Jake and I fi rst began to speak, that there’s a lot of accom-
plishment in this room. I didn’t call you an asshole because I didn’t know you were accom-
plished. I knew you were accomplished and I called you an asshole. Like Jake said: There’s a lot
of satisfaction in what he does and there’s the possibility of a lot more satisfaction in what he
does. That is what the asshole was about. It was not meant to denigrate you. It was said in full
knowledge of your accomplishment. It was way more insulting than you thought, but it was
not meant to denigrate. It was said in full knowledge that you’re accomplished and there’s a lot
more there could be.
JAKE
This has been a great experience. I stole a lot of the microphone—talking is another racket. I’ve
got every racket in this room. And I think everybody else in this room have all the rackets...
ERHARD
Yeah: because they’re not your rackets. The racket is not yours. You are the rackets. The racket
owns you; you don’t own the racket.
JAKE
I came in with a chip on my shoulder too. You invited us to speak there at the beginning. I
thought I would ask a question that would really throw this guy about guests for the evening
session, and the money. This experience was a genuine experience and I owe you an apology
for that.
ERHARD
The apology is: You made this work for you.
JAKE
I did.
ERHARD
That makes us even.
(applause)
KIPP
Okay, we’re about to go on a break. Standing in the empty and meaninglessness of life, see if a
conversation for possibility, for participating in life...
ERHARD
Let’s not give them an assignment at this point. Just stay with the empty and meaningless, we’ll
talk about the rest of it when you get back.
