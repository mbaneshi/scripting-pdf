SPEAKING BEING
DIANE (hesitating)
Brown.
ERHARD
If it had a geometric shape, what would it be?
DIANE
Triangular.
ERHARD
How much water would it hold?
DIANE
About a pint.
ERHARD
On a scale of one to ten, where is it?
DIANE
Six and a half.
ERHARD
Why do you have it?
DIANE
Because it’s been a long day.
ERHARD
Headache and long day live in diff erent realms. You have collapsed them. So,
why do you have a headache?
DIANE
Because I’ve been sitting still.
ERHARD
So you’ve got two domains collapsed. Every time I ask you that stupid question 
“Why?” it collapses the two domains.
(repeating this series of questions several times)
How’s your headache now?
DIANE
It’s a four.
ERHARD
How much water would it hold? 
DIANE
Still a pint.
ERHARD
It’s critically important that you get it. The headache now and the headache
a moment ago are collapsed together. When she says the headache is “still” a 
pint, I know she has collapsed the headache now with the representation of 
the headache then.
(continuing to question her regarding the headache’s shape, color and location 
right now)
Do you have a headache?
DIANE
No, I don’t.
ERHARD (to the group)
What happened was, I asked her questions which in order to answer she had
to be in the presence of her headache like a presence.
DIANE
I focused on it.
ERHARD
No! What happened was you got the domains uncollapsed. All that happened
was that the headache, instead of showing up in the vicious circle, showed up
distinct in the domain of presence. You looked at your headache. You were
present to the headache. There are no reasons when the headache is like a
presence.
A second demonstration followed with Patricia, a participant who said she was 
tired. She sat in one of the director’s chairs; Erhard sat on the arm of his, facing 
her. 
ERHARD
How tired are you on a scale from one to ten?
