Forum Day Four: Session Three 495
MIKE
No I don’t.
ERHARD
You’ve got to say slow or fast. Don’t you.
MIKE
Right.
ERHARD
How fast does the baseball travel when the pitcher pitches?
MIKE
Maybe sixty miles an hour?
ERHARD
Is that fast?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
Not for guys with high batting averages: That looks like a home run. A ball traveling that fast:
That’s a ball with home run written on it. That’s like me picking up this ball off  the fl oor for
them. It occurs as a home-run pitch if it’s traveling fast enough. And for me, I don’t even see it.
Right?
MIKE
Right.
ERHARD
Same ball traveling at the same speed according to the radar gun, occurs one way for one person
and a diff erent way for a diff erent person.
MIKE
So state what you said about occurring? You mentioned something else...
ERHARD
I said that your actions are a correlate of the occurring. Your actions dance with the way the
world occurs for you, not the way the world is. And not because of something inside you,
Mike. You don’t have properties inside you. You don’t have skill or intelligence or stupidity
or clumsiness inside of you. All you’ve got is your actions correlated with the world as an
occurring.

SPEAKING BEING
ERHARD (throwing the ball just out of Mike’s reach)
Why did you put your hand up there when I threw the ball?
MIKE
To catch the ball.
ERHARD
No you didn’t. Did you say, “I’m going to catch this ball?”
MIKE
To myself I did.
ERHARD
Did you really?
MIKE
Yes I did.
ERHARD (throwing the ball again out of Mike’s range)
What did you say then?
MIKE
I said...
ERHARD
You didn’t say a goddamned thing! Nothing. Afterwards, in the moment afterwards, you might
have said, “that’s not catchable.” If the ball was catchable for you, you would have reached over.
And you may or may not have caught it, but you would have reached over. Are you athletic?
(pausing)
Stop thinking! Are you athletic or not?
MIKE
I’m neither.
ERHARD
You’re a person for whom the ball is slow and fat. And I’m a person for whom the ball is very
small and fast. And the slower the ball goes, the more athletic you look. Is that clear?
MIKE
Yes.
ERHARD
Very good. Thanks.
