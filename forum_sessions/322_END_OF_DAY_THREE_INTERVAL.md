END OF DAY THREE INTERVAL
In Heidegger’s work, of course, the distinctions are presented in writing. While
many of his published works were originally delivered as lectures, and although
he is reported to have been exceptionally dynamic in their delivery, there is little
evidence that dialogue was an element of his pedagogy; and in the cultural context
in which he worked, certainly nothing like the personal interactions of The Forum
would have been possible (see the sidebar “Heidegger’s Pedagogy,” in Session Two
of Day Two).
But consider: while Heidegger’s collected works include 102 volumes, he is gen-
erally acknowledged to have been single-minded in his exploration of one question:
the question of Being and its meaning. As he wrote in 1947, “To think is to confine
yourself to a single thought that one day stands still like a star in the world’s sky”
(“TP” in PLT 4)

. Significantly, a few pages later we find: “What is spoken is never, and
in no language, what is said” (“TP” in PLT 11).

In Heidegger’s writing, then, the distinctions that he created to speak Being are
generated and communicated in the unspoken/unwritten background. There is, we
propose, a central encompassing distinction—the Distinction—that is hinted at by all
of the distinctions, a “single thought” that remains unspoken and the Same through
all of the turns and evolutions of his thinking. The rubrics for the various distinc-
tions that comprise the Distinction, such as the Same, the they-self, and the Nothing,
occur repeatedly throughout his work as he opens new ways into the distinctions,
beginning from diff erent originating terms. In an essay from a collection entitled
Holzwege (“Woodpaths”), Heidegger wrote this:
“
“Wood” is an old name for forest. In the wood are paths
that mostly wind along until they end quite suddenly in an
impenetrable thicket. They are called woodpaths. Each goes
its particular way, but in the same forest. Oft en it seems as
though one were identical to another. Yet it only seems so.
Woodcutters and foresters are familiar with these paths. They
know what it means to be on a woodpath. (Quoted in Krell,
“Introduction,” BW 34)

For the authors of this book, our experience of Werner Erhard’s work has enabled
us in negotiating the “impenetrable thickets” of Heidegger’s writing—if not with the
skill of woodcutters, at least with the sense that we are always on a way.
Krell comments that in Germany, “to be on a woodpath” means to be in a cul-
de-sac, a path that leads nowhere and has no exit. As an analogy for the rhetorical
strategies we find in the work of Werner Erhard, the “no exit” image is of interest.
Forum Day Three: End of Day Three Interval 309
Throughout this book, we are proposing that both Heidegger and Erhard make
important use of reflexive languaging—ideas presented in such a way that they turn
thinking back upon itself, pulling the rug out from under the reader or the listener
(e.g., “This statement is false”). We suggest that the reflexive impulse (reflex, reflec-
tion, self-referentiality, getting the joke) pervades the thinking and the languaging
of both men, most dramatically when they are saying the Nothing. These reflexive
processes share a particular aff inity with the movement of thinking that makes
available an experience of Being, and one view is that they evoke a cul-de-sac.
At a debriefing meeting between sessions of the 1989 Forum, Erhard told The
Forum leaders that the “critical condition of satisfaction” for doing The Forum is
that for the participants it must be inescapable. That is, in Heidegger’s terms, all
exits by which the they-self might escape an authentic confrontation with its own
thrownness must be closed. To this end, a cul-de-sac may be a useful model; and
The Forum’s culminating distinction (as well as the final process of the est Training)
t
may be seen as eff ective speaking of that form.
The French existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre evoked the cul-de-sac image in the
title of his play, No Exit; and one of Heidegger’s most important essays, published in
1947 as the “Letter On Humanism,” was written, in part, as a response to an essay
by Sartre. A comparison of Sartre’s thinking with Heidegger’s is beyond the scope of
this book, but we will gloss the diff erence in this way: for neither man is there an exit
from the trap of the human situation; but for Heidegger, the appropriation of that
situation—the appropriation of entrapment—creates the possibility of authentic
entrapment. The situation becomes the Situation, which gives releasement.  ■
