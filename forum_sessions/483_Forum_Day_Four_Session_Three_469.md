Forum Day Four: Session Three 469
did anything, I just went to school and I loved God and I did what my parents told me to do, and
it worked. It was kind of like that for a few years. I remember starting third grade, and the fi rst
day—and I always sat in the front row, I loved to participate—the teacher kept asking all these
questions and I kept raising my hand, participating and answering the questions and was giving
all the right answers, and the teacher said “You are going to be my best student.” She went on
and asked another question, and I gave my answer and I got it wrong. And she looked at me and
said “That was really stupid.” And that was it! That was it! I just said “Okay! Fine! We’ll do it your
way” and it’s been that way ever since. And the funny thing is, I really got that’s defi nitely the
point at which I started to withdraw. It started to become about me. Up to that point there wasn’t
me, there was just participating and I felt like life was a privilege all the time...

There’s something in there, a bit clouded. You might not have seen it. Up until that point there
was just participation. Not me. When you’re really participating, you’re not even there. You
know, when you’re really dancing, or really cooking, or really involved in something in life that
you love—that’s happening, not you.

So when she said “You’re going to be my best student,” or whatever the hell she said to me, well
I had never thought about that, I never thought that there was a best or a worst or anything like
that. I started thinking, “Well, I’m going to be the best!” And the next stupid thing out of my
mouth was the exact wrong thing to say, and I decided that...
KIPP
The next stupid thing out of your mouth was the next thing out of your mouth.
PARTICIPANT (Forum leader 13, laughing)
I don’t even remember what it was, and when I got in touch with it today, I was like, “ahh yeah!
I fi nally got my incident!” And it made absolutely no diff erence to know what it was. None!
KIPP (to applause)
Thank you very much. You know, there’s a story in science called evolution. In that story,
sometime, a long time ago, there was a little bit of something that became life in the water. It
started to evolve over eons of time. And then in a moment, a fi sh walked out of the water onto
land. That’s no longer evolution. It’s the evolution of evolution. That’s transformation. What
the past four days have been about was providing you a clearing to walk out on the land. And
the truth is you are not equipped for the land. What the seminars are about is equipping you to
create a new possibility of growth and learning and extraordinary results on the land. And if
you apply the rules of the water to see if you’re going to be in a seminar or not, they’re not going
to work. I invite you to choose to be in a seminar. Don’t concern yourself with which seminar
to be in. If the seminar reserved for you works, do that. If that night doesn’t work, pick another
one. Some of you are saying, fi rst I’ve got to digest The Forum. I invite you to consider what
you digest turns into. You are invited to participate. And you have the right to decline... ...When

SPEAKING BEING
I fi rst started doing this work I’d get up in front of people and they’d send me up notes saying,
“You are a disgusting person. Get off  it.” But I didn’t know how. And two things allowed me to
get off  it. I gave my word to be a Forum leader. And the people in this room didn’t give up on
me. They were more committed to me than I was.
Kipp then set up for the seminar enrollment. A number of people in The Forum group—many of
them WE&A staff  and Forum leaders—stood and moved to the enrolment tables that were placed
around the room. There followed a period of about 45 minutes during which participants could
register for a seminar series.
At the conclusion of the enrollment period, participants returned to their seats. It was 9:00 pm.
Werner Erhard was on the platform.
ERHARD
Okay, as you know, we’re at the second half of The Forum now. Everybody clear about that?
We’ve done enough going backwards; we’re starting to move forward. Nick?
NICK
You know this thing about mucking around in the swamp at the bottom of the Valley of the
Shadow of Death: I’ve been swimming there for the past couple of months. The thing that I
came face to face with was that I was afraid that I was a nobody. But it was more than being
afraid, it was actually being a nobody. Last night we were driving home and I was sharing with...
ERHARD
Whatever you’re afraid you might be, you are, by virtue of being afraid that you might be. Not
like you are for real. Whatever it is that you can’t be owns you.
NICK
When I was a kid, I had a great childhood, and I had a great friend. My memory of it was... like it
was telepathy. We were completely, totally, absolutely related to each other. One time we both wore
shorts, we both got cowboy boots for Christmas, and we walked around with them on the wrong
feet, and had the best time, always together. We were almost never not together. I ate dinner at his
house, he ate dinner at my house. And then one day during the summer between kindergarten
and fi rst grade, his mother told me they were going to move and I was never going to see him
again. I didn’t quite understand what that meant. One day they loaded everything up in a truck
and a station wagon, and he got in the car and they pulled away and I never saw him again. In this
work on rackets I was looking for this decision that I made, and it wasn’t a decision like something
I could see happening. It was more like pulling out a tablecloth from under everything on the
table. Everything was the same but it was suddenly diff erent. Completely diff erent. I knew there
was something wrong. But it wasn’t like there was something wrong. There was something wrong.
ERHARD
Nick has told this clearly enough that you can get it. I don’t know if you can picture it or not,
but the scenery is all the same. All the scenery is the same except there’s something wrong.
