Forum Day One: Session Two

ERHARD
I apologize.
PARTICIPANT
Yeah, sure.
ERHARD
Is that like “fuck you”? Do you mean “I don’t feel apologize”? I’m not my feelings. I’m my
mouth. You’re not your mouth. You say “okay” when you mean “Fuck you.”
PARTICIPANT
Not always.
ERHARD
You did that time.
PARTICIPANT
That’s true.
Throughout this interaction Erhard’s style was relaxed but direct.
ERHARD (to the group)
The truth is that whether you keep your word depends on how you feel. Create this possibility:
that you present yourself as someone who keeps your word, but in fact does or does not depend-
ing on whether you feel like it. Try on that possibility. “Honor your promise” means something
like keep them in spite of the circumstances. Try on this possibility: that you present yourself as
f
someone who keeps your word, but in fact are someone who does or does not keep your word
depending on whether you feel like it. Try that on. I say that if you do that you will have the
freedom to honor your word. I know more about lying than most people in this room. I’ve lied
more than most people in this room, and I know the kind of life it gives. And it’s my observation
that you’re never going to be able to honor your word until you can be with yourself in the way
in which I just accused you of being. I say that until you can be with that, you can’t honor your
word. By the way, I want to introduce a phrase here: that would be called being authentic about
being inauthentic. Who doesn’t get this?
MARY
I know that sometimes I won’t keep my word.
ERHARD
But you don’t present yourself as that.

SPEAKING BEING
MARY
No, I do what I do.
ERHARD
You say, “Hey Werner, I’m going to meet you tomorrow at noon...”
MARY
And I’ll get there at two.
ERHARD
But you don’t say, “But Werner, I may show up and I may not.”
MARY
No.
ERHARD
That’s the inauthenticity. If you went around saying to people, “Look, I’ll give my word, and
maybe I’ll keep it and maybe I won’t.” Nothing inauthentic about that—that’s quite straight.
MARY
And I’m right about that.
ERHARD
We’ll discuss more about that later. You get what I mean about that being inauthentic? Anybody
who can’t see that?
JAKE
I make the best eff ort to... I don’t understand.
ERHARD
Let me tell you how I listen. I just told you that one and one equals two. And I asked you if you
got that, and you said you’re confused. So I think you’ve got something going on in this area.
JAKE
That’s one of the reasons why I raised my hand.
ERHARD
You’re not confused; you’ve got something going on.
JAKE
I’ve got something going on.
Getting It and Losing It
The Forum content is communicated through the gradual
development of a series of distinctions. These distinctions off er
access to a certain way of being; they are ontological clearings,
contexts of meaning. They shape the way the circumstances of
life occur so that a new way of being with those circumstances
arises naturally. The new way of being becomes a possibility when
the distinction is “gotten”—in Heideggerian terms, in a moment
of Augenblick, or ontological insight. Thus the purpose of The
Forum is to have participants “get” the distinctions deeply enough
during the course of the four days that they leave The Forum
dwelling in those distinctions. As Erhard told The Forum leaders
during a debriefing, “What makes a diff erence is that there is a
conversation generated that distinguishes the distinction, and that
they’re dwelling in the conversation,” that is, they are “used by”
the distinction rather than caught up trying to remember a piece of
information as a precondition to being able to apply it.
