Forum Day Four: Session Three 521
For example, if I really meant to do it, that’s just as good for you as if I did it. You can’t even
tell the diff erence. You don’t relate to people out of what they produce, you relate to people out
of their sincerity. No shit. So. There’s another possibility. And the other possibility is an Age
of Integrity. That’s diff erent than the age of sincerity. In the age of integrity you are your word.
Real simple. You just got clear that who you are is your feelings, your attitudes, your states of
mind, your internal state. In the age of integrity you are your word. That means you honor your
word as yourself. You’ve got to get that, because if you don’t you won’t get the rest of what I’m
going to say. You’ve got to get it abstractly. Not conceptually, but just the way I say it. You’ve got
to create the possibility of actually being your word. Not the idea of being your word. Not the
option of being my word. I am my word. I’ve got feelings, and I’ve got thoughts and attitudes
and a state of mind, and I have a hand. I am not my hand. I take care of my hand, I enjoy my
hand, I celebrate my hand, but I’m not my hand. And I have feelings. I take care of my feelings,
I enjoy my feelings, I celebrate my feelings, but I’m not my feelings, or my states of mind, or
my moods any more than I’m my hand. In an age of integrity you would be your word and you
would honor your word as your self: You wouldn’t honor your feelings as your self, you would
honor your word as your self. You would be your word and you would have feelings. Not be
your feelings. You be you word and have feelings like you have a hand. You would have feelings,
and have thoughts, and have an attitude, and have a state of mind, and you wouldn’t be that. So
instead of your life being shaped by your thoughts and feelings and attitudes, your life would
be shaped by your word. Because your word would be the context in which the world occurs,
and your feelings and your actions and your thoughts would be a correlate of an occurring that
arose in a world created by your word. So you would be able to love somebody just by saying so.
See, if I am my word and I say “I love you,” I love you. And it’s got power that your feelings will
never have. No diff erent than feeling “I love you.” See, if who you are is feeling, feeling “I love
you” is the same as if who you are is your word saying “I love you.” The same except that being
your feelings will never have the power that being your word has, because you’ve got something
to say about your word, and ain’t got shit to say about what you feel. When you start to honor
your word as yourself, live as your word, be your word, I don’t mean some silly moral horseshit
about keeping your word. You see this is only a possibility: You can’t struggle toward this; you
can’t set this up as a goal; you can’t try to achieve this; you can’t pray for this. You’ve got to
live in the possibility of this, because that’s the only way it will work. To live in the possibility,
to live from the possibility of being your word, and having your feelings, and your thoughts,
and your state of mind, and having your attitude, et cetera. It gives you power to love people,
rather than have love for them. It makes your word kind of sacred, and it gives you access to
the sacred. Being happy is a sacred state. See, if you are your word, you can say “I am happy”
and you are happy. And it ain’t a bunch of fucking words: It’s your self. It’s no diff erent than
reporting on your internal state. If what you are is your internal state, then to say “I’m happy,”
you’ve got to have an internal state called happy. But if you’re your word, you’re happy because
you say you’re happy: I am happy.” Your feelings and your attitudes and your state of mind and
your thoughts and your hand start to line up with your word. I don’t assess my feelings. I don’t
address my feelings to fi nd out who I am. I don’t look at my hand to fi nd out who I am either. I
also don’t look at my nose or my feet to fi nd out who I am. I don’t look at my feelings to fi nd out
who I am. And my hand lines up with who I am and so do my feelings, and so do my thoughts.
So I’m leaving you at this juncture of The Forum with the possibility of honoring your word as
ERHARD (continuing)
In an age of integrity you would be your word
and you would honor your word as your self:
You wouldn’t honor your feelings as your self,
you would honor your word as your self. You
would be your word and you would have feel-
ings. Not be your feelings. You be you word and
have feelings like you have a hand. You would
have feelings, and have thoughts, and have
an attitude, and have a state of mind, and you
wouldn’t be that. So instead of your life being
shaped by your thoughts and feelings and atti-
tudes, your life would be shaped by your word.

your self. Honoring your word as your self. Honoring your word as your self. Okay, speaking
about one’s word, and all the acknowledgments.
(pausing)
If I gave everyone in the room who’s awake an opportunity to speak, we would all thank each
other. The other people who participated in The Forum gave you an enormous gift, one of great
generosity and magnanimity. You did not pay for The Forum. You did not. The Forum you just
participated in was a gift from the people who assisted here—to you. Not to you as a personality
because they didn’t know you personally. It was a gift to the possibility that you are. This thing
wouldn’t exist without them. There were one hundred and twenty to one hundred and thirty
people who volunteered their time and their intelligence and their ability and their energy
and their humanity so that we could do this Forum together. They got here before you or I did,
and were here after you and I left. You wouldn’t have even gotten enrolled if it weren’t for the
assistants. And you know the kind of courage it took to enroll you. And the deep profound
humanity that it took to put up with your shit. So I wanted to give you an opportunity to
acknowledge the assistants.
(long, loud standing ovation)
Thirty-three staff  members of WE&A from diff erent centers put this together. If you get a
chance to be around staff  members, I recommend that you take that opportunity. Something
rubs off . You know, they are ordinary people like you and me. They’re not something
extraordinary. But what they’ve chosen to do with their lives... what gives you your life—listen
up—what gives you your life gives you: you. And what they’ve chosen to do with their lives
gives them something, and you ought to get some of that. And the way to get some of that is
be around them. One of the things you can do is nurture them and support them. That’d be all
right. The other thing you could do is assist with them. Hang out and watch them. I’d like to
give us an opportunity to acknowledge those thirty-three staff  members who created this Forum
for us.

Erhard at this point invited participants to go to church with him on New Years’ Eve.
ERHARD
I’m inviting you to go to church tomorrow night, New Year’s Eve. Some of you need to go to
church on New Year’s Eve.
(laughter)
It’s an Episcopal church, but there will be a rabbi (a she), a priest, a Zen monk, whatever you’re
up to you’ll be all right. You know, I spent a lot of time in church because my grandmother
got me up on Sunday morning and made me go to church every Sunday. After a while I kind
of liked it a little bit. I served on the alter and swung the incense. I wrote a little bit when I
went to school, and got an award for something I wrote, and the best thing I wrote was about
