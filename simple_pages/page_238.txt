SPEAKING BEING
BETH (to the group) 
All available men: see me at the break.
ERHARD
Very good trolling. Have them line up.
(to the group)
There was a little something you didn’t get out of that. 
Erhard held up his hands and stuck one index fi nger into the circled fi ngers of the other hand, 
making a gesture indicating the sex act.
ERHARD
This is very signifi cant. God and that. 
Erhard looked over at Angel, the participant who had shared the day before about being twice-
divorced.
ERHARD
What are you doing over there, Angel?
ANGEL (angrily)
What do you mean nothing means anything?
ERHARD (to Angel)
I didn’t say “nothing means anything.”
(making the sex-act gesture)
I said this... means this. Stand up. 
(to the group)
How would you like to carry around what she carries around?
ANGEL
You gave me something yesterday, and you just now took it away.
ERHARD
And you turned it into shit when I gave to you. And I didn’t give it to you anyhow; you gave it 
to your self, but then you turned it into shit, because you made it mean something, and now 
you’ve got a new soap opera. The old soap opera was “I was divorced twice.” Now you got a new 
soap opera. Can you not see that you’re stuck and you have a conversation with Kipp and me to 
get unstuck? Then we bring up some new thing and then you get stuck again. You’re a series of 
stucks, one after the other after the other after the other, making up stucks. Tell us your story 
here. What is it that’s bothering you? Tell Kipp.
